Note to Staff at Governor Jeb Bush's office:  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!  I don't know what you did - but people are calling me back from Sprint PCS!!!  THANK YOU!!!
 
__________________________________________________________________________
Hi Diana Falise,
Please forgive me for the lengthy delay.  I am a Charlie victim who is running a multi-family dwelling rebuild, in addition to my full-time "salaried-plus-mountains-of-overtime" job, and a protracted fight with FEMA.
 
Summary:
After hurricane Charley on 08/13/04 (followed by Frances, Jean & Ivan), Sprint sustained over 1 million requests for service on their PCS/DSL/Residential systems.  Their operation was unable to restore residential service to my S Ft Myers neighborhood for 2 months.  When they finally did get residential services back up they were not continuous.  The key issue for me to the present time is that when residential services are not provided, there is no automatic concurrent reduction in my monthly phone bill. 
 
This issue is made more complex by the practice of billing for services not rendered.  Each billing period contains approx. a week of time that has not yet passed.  So what happens if services fail during that period?  How is this failure accounted for in Sprint's billing system?  
 
Despite numerous residential service failures, I have never had my bill voluntarily reduced by Sprint.  I have to call them and negotiate their phone system to get to a CSR who can adjust my bill according to what I tell them...  These CSRs usually make the change without a complaint, but I have had some (in the now closed Vegas call center) not believe me and give me a hard time.
 
I will send a complete set of my bills to you next week.  Below is the chronology of what Sprint Residential has put me through.  Some of the residential service issues seemed to be linked to my DSL installation issues.  I have italicized and colored the residential issues light blue to make them easier to pick out.  I understand that the FL PSC does not address DSL service issues... but you can't get Sprint DSL service without having Sprint Residential first - so they become linked when there are service problems.
 
Thank you for whatever you can do on this.  
 
Sincerely, 
Grayson Porter        (m) 239-839-4031

Cypress Lake Office Boss = Mr. Brasher  Local Svc Rep: Robert (c) 839-9433 (lost house on FMY Bch to fire/arson)   NCSC - Natl Cust Serv Center - BILLING: 800-339-1811 M-F 

Post Installation Tips from Technician: On Sprint website go to: sprintdslhelp.com Any internet explorer problems go to:  Tools -> internet options --> Connectors --> Never dial, then lan button --> none of 3 boxes to be checked.

05/04 Computer hooked up to Internet. Jim Technician #20113 - Came out to 10931 Meadowlark Cove Drive and performed the installation; he brought the 645 Series modem that was declared outdated 2 weeks later. GP never could get the modem update program to run and eventually had to have on-line DSL tech help run it with GP on the phone to go through the prompts.

08/13/04 Hurricane Charley Destroyed home's interior, windows and roof.

08/21/04 4:30pmEST - Call to Establish Residential Service & Residential DSL Service 
_____, CSR (Called from friend's house)
08/23/04 DSL service will be put on vacation until 09/07/04.
09/07/04 Residential Service will be re-established on same number at different location
09/07/04 DSL will be established with no reconnection fee; Order#CA57026 1) DSL Hook Up will be free for Charley customers and, 2) Residential # will be kept the same.

09/08/04 Status Call - GP called and CSR said that residential/DSL start date was always 09/30/04 and had never been scheduled for 09/07/04.

09/30/04 Residential Service Actually Started 

10/02/04 Status Call - GP called to find out status and CSR said that residential/DSL service was never scheduled to begin on 09/30/04 - it had always been scheduled for 10/25/04.

10/11/04 Sprint Billing Issue 239-454-9400 
CSR: Kiera GP called to find out what was going on and Keira told her that the current schedule was:

10/21/04 DSL & Home Service original scheduled to start BUT

10/12/04 DSL billing now actually scheduled to start; GP had DSL billing start date moved out to 10/21/04 again.

10/13/04 WEB HELP DSL Tech Service/On-line E-Mail Instructions (misc. technicians over a 3 week period) GP contacted to see what the next step would be fore re-establishing DSL service at the temporary address. The On-line techs misdirected GP and said that a wall splitter would be sent to GP's physical address. They could not say what address it was being sent too (GP has 3). GP waited for part to be sent to one of her addresses, but the only thing that happened was that (3) line filters were left at GP's temporary apartment door (#2102, 16130 Bayside Point East Drive) on 10/12/04. No other contact was made. . Note: Later, Sprint Billing office staff (Cindy) said a splitter had to be installed in the wall.

10/13/04 - DSL Service Still Interrupted

CSR: Cindy. GP called to 800-339-1811 to make sure that she was not being billed.
Cindy found an "Error" in the account and had to get a supervisor to fix it; total call time 20-30 minutes. Cindy was from Ft Myers and very nice. She said repeatedly that she knew what GP was going through. She had to contact her supervisor to resolve the "error" issue. GP told her everything that had happened so far. Cindy set up DSL installation for 10/22/04 10:00am - 12:00 Noon; Order#C714369.

10/19/04 WEB HELP/On-line Tech providing E-Mail Instructions from DSL Tech Service

After finding out from Cindy that everything the DSL on-line technicians had said was wrong, GP sent note to general DSLTechserv@sprint.com forwarding the erroneous notes, and stating that the advice she had received via e-mails for the previous (3) weeks was wrong.

10/22/04 DSL Installation Failure - Order#C714369 Cancelled by Mysterious Person
First Call - 877-677-7596 Tech Status Center - 12am GP called to find out what had happened to the technician and the CSR had a hard time finding the order because eventually she determined that it had been cancelled. She could not say who was responsible for cancelling the order, or track back to that person in any way. 

Second Call - When GP escalated, the CSR sent GP to a toll free number that went down shortly after she began talking to the next CSR: Jay at 800-672-6242 .
Third Call - 877-646-3282 Tech Service Center - GP then tried to call the original Tech Svc Center # to reschedule the installation appointment and those lines were down too. 

10/23/04 Second Attempt to Reschedule DSL Installation

CSR: Jeff 877-646-3282 Jeff was pleasant and rescheduled the appointment for Monday 10/25/04 3-5pm EST. He also gave GP an ombudsman number to call 877-677-7596 for status if anything happened.

10/25/04 DSL Installation Partial Success

GP got time off from work and met the Spring DSL Tech person at her temporary apartment. A White single line DSL jack was installed in the kitchen and a Removable $2.99 wall splitter plug was installed in the bedroom where the computer is. This part could have been purchased at Radio Shack and was NOT what the Sprint Billing office rep Cindy said was supposed to be installed in GP's location. Technician was polite and helpful. GP did not stand over his shoulder and didn't notice that the jack in the bedroom had not been installed in the wall.

10/26/04 Sprint Billing Issue - Residential DSL Service 239-454-9400 
CSR: Saria.
GP had received (2) bills for -5.47 credit. GP was calling to find out the status of the billing for ALL sprint services. (See Sprint PCS chronology for call results).

Saria convinced GP to upgrade her DSL to 1.5 something for the same rate of $49.99 and said she was giving her a 2 week credit because of the DSL service failure. She gave GP a URL 67.76.113.44, but GP isn't sure what that was supposed to be for.

11/14/04 No Earthlink Internet Service & Sprint DSL Service Failure

GP got Earthlink's# from 800-555-1212 

1) Earthlink rep said they couldn't help GP trouble shoot the issue and to contact a local # for Sprint. The number provided by Earthlink rep at 800-719-4660 --> 935-0013 was fax number not a local assistance provider.

2) GP dialed back to 800-719-4660 - on hold12:19pm to12:20pm EST and got Josh. GP gave Josh location city & state; Josh had to transfer GP to the "Earthlink Sprint support technical staff." GP told him please not to transfer GP to Sprint staff. They are horrible and that GP is suing Sprint.

The recorded msg Josh transferred GP to anyway, was pure Sprint. The female recorded msg voice spoke really fast so GP had to repeat the msg cycle over and over to hear everything and try to make the right choice. GP chose the recorded msg that gave status of current outages and there weren't any. [A week later Texas CSR Annie said she had "just" gotten an e-mail saying there were outage issues in Ft Myers, FL] 

GP was offerred an option to return to Technical support for Earthlink customers, which sent GP back to "Earthlink Support". The CSR who took the call was Deshawn. DeShawn said she had never gotten a "que call" of your nature," so GP mentioned that she was suing Sprint. DeShawn said she had never dealt with Sprint connection type issue. DeShawn had to go back to her supervisor to see if she could take the call. 

The supervisor said that DeShawn could not address GP's issue. The Earthlink supervisor said that the call had to be transferred back to Sprint for support. DeShawn confirmed that Earthlink had created a business partnership with Sprint that does not provide support to Earthlink customers. GP stated clearly that this situation would forever alienate GP from Earthlink's services, and she would recommend that Earthlink be avoided. DeShawn forgot to transfer GP to the Sprint Tech Support staff or provide a phone number. She just said good bye and hung up.

GP called back to Earthlink Tech support. It took 3 iterations, and several nonsensical menus, to get to the hold que for Earthlink's support staff once again 12:48pm EST. John. John gave GP the Sprint DSL 877-646-3282 12:53pm EST. GP told John to please tell his supervisor/team leader during the next meeting that Sprint's lousy service to Earthlink clients was giving Earthlink a bad name and that he had talked to someone who was suing Sprint because of their service quality.

Now GP was back to the same menu that Josh sent her to originally. GP had to chose the residential option (1) twice to get the selection to go through. Recorded msg said that wait time would be "under 5 minutes" but GP was on hold from 12:56pm EST to 1:14pm EST. CSR Melissa came on the line requesting the phone# and area code first. GP stated it and Melissa asked for it again. GP stated it again and said that she had just stated it. Melissa said that she could not hear any response and recommended that the caller call back on 877-646-3282 and hung up on GP!! GP tested the plugs and they were all seated. While Melissa was making her statement that would allow her to hang up, GP said, "No! Don't hang up on me! I have been on hold for 15 minutes!" But Melissa hung up anyway. This was on a direct dial in on a number that GP had called minutes before.

GP called back on 877-646-3282 opt 3 and eventually got a recording to troubleshoot the system automatically. GP followed the recorded instructions, rebooted and restarted the modem and stayed on hold the entire time from 1:19 pm to1:41pm EST. CSR Matthew came on the line and asked for the home residential #. The call was a success and Matthew scheduled a technician to come out on 11/15/04, Order#0638437. The problem was that Matthew did not tell GP what time he was scheduling the DSL technician to come out on Monday.

11/15/04 DSL & Residential Service Appt Failure

2:45pm DSL Technician Mike called GP at work on her cell# 239-839-4031 to get directions. GP was going into a conf call and couldn't come out to let Mike into the unit. So Mike checked all of the exterior areas to see if there were any issues and there weren't. Mike had to close the request due to Sprint policy even though the problem had not been solved. Mike was apologetic because he had heard many horror stories from customers about calling Sprint's Customer Service lines.

11/15/04 Reshedule DSL & Residential Service Appt

GP had to call back to reschedule Mike, or someone, to come out the following day. She dialed 877-646-3282 and was on hold from 7:46pm until 7:51pm. 

CSR: Rick took the call; Rick was fine. The Appt was rescheduled for 1:45 - 3:45PM on 11/16/04 Order#0654874. 

11/16/04 Missed Service Call - GP failed to Take Sprint PCS Cell Phone to Work

Sprint DSL & Residential Technician could not contact GP on (c) 239-839-4031 and therefore could not access the property and call had to be cancelled.

11/17/04 Massive billing errors on first full hard copy residential & DSL invoice.

GP tried to call Sprint 6:00pm Billing Office is closed; Automated system only; no dispute addressed.

11/17/04 Call to Reschedule Sprint DSL & Residential Technician (failed appt on 11/16/04)

CSR: Michael - GP explained that dial tone was lost on one jack after the tech checked the exterior systems on Monday 11/15. Michael put GP on hold from 6:16pm until 6:18pm. A residential dial tone is required to reschedule the DSL technician so Michael told GP to call 800-339-1811 Customer Svc to get service on the actual phone line. GP told him she had just come from there while researching the massive overbilling (that is the number on the Sprint bill) and it had said "come back during business hours." 

So Michael gave GP another number to a fully automated system for getting service on the line: 

1-800-788-3600 Opt 3, Opt1, Opt 1. #0683936 - To get a Sprint Technician to work on the problem between now and 6:00pm on 11/18/04. GP never spoke to a real person on this call.

Next GP found a number in old call records 877-677-7596 Natl Customer Status Center - GP called because she had never tried the number before. She got CSR Lilly who confirmed that conf# was in the system.

AN AMAZING THING HAPPENED 5 MINUTES LATER - DSL & DIALTONE WERE RESTORED (Temporarily) After logging the residential dial tone issue on 800-788-3600 on the automated system. So GP called back to Sprint DSL 877-646-3282 and got Perkins; GP asked Perkins to update her acct record that the DSL line started up miraculously on its own!!:)

11/18/04 Call to Report DSL & Res Line Svc Failure & Reschedule Res DSL Svc Tech

7:22pm DSL would not come up when GP got home from work. GP tried the shut down and restart troubleshooting, but it did not activate the DSL connection. GP called to restart Order#0654874. After being on hold from 7:23pm to 7:27pm she got CSR: George. George rescheduled a DSL tech to come out to the temporary apartment on Friday 11/19/04 at 4:15pm on Order#0698248. GP said that was a risky time to schedule the technician for...but she would go with it. She made sure that George put her cell phone number in as the "can be reached number." [Unfortunately, the "can be reached number George actually put in was not GP's cell phone number as requested.]

11/19/04 Friday - Sprint DSL & Residential Service Tech No Show/Self Cancellation of Order#0698248.  GP got home at 4:15pm on the nose to meet the technician. There was no one waiting and no dialtone in the kitchen but there was a dialtone in the bedroom. DSL was still down. 

To kill time, at 4:45pm, GP decided to call Sprint DSL billing to clean up the Residential & DSL billing issues. John, Altamonte Springs,Orlando,FL - John removed the partial month charges because they were primarily against a time period when there was no service. John was very helpful and informative. He explained that for GP to have gotten all of the Sprint services on one monthly bill, she would have had to satisfy (2) criteria:

a) B class customer on local service payment record - she is

b) Must have purchased a calling feature bundle package - she did not. [Crystal (the original PSC sales person) failed to mention either of these criteria when GP signed up for PCS service.]

Since the DSL Tech John transferred GP to Anne in DSL residential service to find out why the DSL Technician never showed up. Anne discovered that the appointment that was scheduled for Friday 4:15pm Order#0698248 had been cancelled by the technician, because they couldn't get into Bayside Apt Homes to access the unit. Anne checked and discovered that the "can be reached" number George put in the night before was NOT GP's cell phone. It was 239-454-9400 - the phone number in the apartment with the problem. GP had gotten home at 4:15pm on the dot, so there was no reason for the technician had to have left earlier than the appointment time. GP was NOT late.

Anne mentioned that on an E-Mail she had just received, there were DSL outages in Ft Myers. GP told her that she had been trying to reestablish service since the previous Sunday 11/14/04. Anne was very nice and tried to transfer GP to Sprint DSL service to reschedule the appointment and dropped the call instead. 

GP called the Sprint DSL 877-646-3282 and the hold time was 5 minutes. Clayton in Athens, TX came on and rescheduled the appointment for Order#0709895 on 11/22/04 at 11:00am - an actual appointment time. Clayton said that this was the 4th time that an attempt had been made to restore service, so a supervisor would be notified that it existed automatically. Clayton was absolutely great. Over the course of the call, GP explained a bit about what had been happening to her with Sprint. GP & Clayton had a real meeting of the minds. GP committed to send him 12 deluxe homemade triple chocolate chip brownies via Fedex to his office on Tuesday 11/22/04. This will be the first time GP's brownies have gone interstate!! Clayton and GP were on the phone for 45 minutes.

GP always asks all of the CSRs that she explains the entire story too, to please escalate the situation at their next mgmt team meetings. So Clayton told GP to enclose all of the pages of notes she would be taking to Small Claims Court, with the brownies, and he would make sure that it was directed to someone who might be able to make a difference.

11/22/04 Monday Brownie Reward for CSR Clayton Hannah: GP Fedexed (12) brownies to Clayton Hannah and the docs to support her Small Claims lawsuit.  Clayton said he would talk to his supervisors about the situation but GP only got a thank you note for the brownies and no response from his supervisors.

11/22/04 - 11/23/04 DSL Down

12/05/04 Sunday 9:34am Issue: Outgoing E-Mails hung up in the Outbox-Ft Myers area is down.

Duration: From Previous Afternoon

Current: Server connection cannot be maintained and MSN.com cannot be accessed either.
Earthlink E-Mail & Browser Support @9:15am - CSR: Yal - GP explained the nature of mess w/Sprint; GP rattled off all of the acct access info w/o prompting and gave Yal permission to go into her e-mail acct and find out what is going on. Yal came back and said in-box/web mail everything looks good on; using 0% of 10mb. Storage is alright and server 877-646-3282 Sprint DSL connection Tech support. This number was not operating on Sunday 12/05/04. GP finally got to recording that stated that Ft Myers area was down.

12/06/04 DSL still down

GP tried to find the recored msg that would say whether or not Ft Myers was still down. She ended up on the Modem reset instructions. GP did the modem reset and all of her incoming mail started to come in and outgoing mail started to actually send.

Modem Reset: Power Button off and shut down computer completely. Turn the Modem back on. Reboot the computer. Nothing happened.

12/14/04 Phone jack in Bedroom stopped working.

12/30/04 Billing Adjustment to prevent paying for downtime.

CSR: Terry; Call Center: Las Vegas - closing 1/14/04

$1.66/day @ 11 days down

Billing Adjustment: $18.3212/31/04 Outbox items will not send - Repeat Issue.  CSR: Fernando - Cannot help and conferencing GP w/Sprint/Earthlink tech support 

CSR: Jeremy @ Sprint Tried for 45 minutes to reassign and activate Earthlink server connection. The actions he suggested caused the MS Outlook application to be unable to start up. GP shut down the computer and booted back up. GP cleaned all Internet cookies and files off the system and discovered some strange files on the U/Temp directories. She deleted them and the Outlook Outbox sent perfectly. After that, it would never work again. Earthlink Tech Support record now shows that the issue is with Trendmicro anti-virus software - not Earthlink/Sprint.

12/31/04 Schedule DSL Tech to service non-working residential phone jack.

CSR:_______; Call Center: _______; Order#________ (forgot to get info while multi-tasking)

GP made appointment for 01/06/05 at 1:40pm EST. Made an arrangement to have the technician call GP on 239-839-4031 before coming out to make sure that the tech wouldn't cancel the appointment or leave early like twice before.

01/05/05 Phone Jack not working issue - Need to Reschedule DSL Tech due to GE Conf Call.

CSR: Larry; Call Center: Carlisle, PA

On hold for 22 minutes from 9:36pm - 9:58pm. Larry couldn't cancel the appt and couldn't reschedule it. Only the "NCSC" could do that and they close at 9:00pm EST. GP will have to call the NCSC at 877-677-7596 tomorrow during business hours to prevent the technician from showing up that day and reschedule the appt for the next available one after Saturday 1/15/05.

01/06/05 Phone Jack not working issue - Need to Reschedule DSL Tech due to GE Conf Call.

01/15/05 Outbox Issue - GP called Trendmicro to find out what they can do about this issue.

CSR: Jeff; Call Center: San Francisco - Jeff had GP remove outgoing mail scan and reinstall it. Almost all e-mails left at that time, but they started getting hung up the next day.

1/16/05 Outbox Issue - GP called PC tech at Childsplay and was coached through turning off the PCcillin outgoing mailscan completely. The issue was solved.

1/19/05 DSL Tech disabled phone jack during previous installation attempts - Reschedule of appointment from 1/06/05 for 1/19/05 from 12-2:00pm.

11:30am GP started calling 877-646-3282 to verify that the appt still existed because of so many past failures.

CSR: Paul:  Outcome: Paul couldn't help and had to transfer GP to the Natl Cust Svc Center 877-677-7596.

NCSC CSR: Jane:

1) Couldn't tell if appt was still on; but said system showed that FMY was running a day behind.

2) There is no notification of local supervisor if service has been called more than (3) times.

3) Could not conference GP with the local supervisor (Mr. Brasher) to determine if a technician was still scheduled to come out.

4) All she could do was send an e-mail and hope that someone in the Ft Myers Cypress Lake Area Office would read it.  GP requested to be escalated.

NCSC supervisor: Amanda:

1) GP asked to be sure to note in the record what kind of issues GP has been having

2) Amanda read the notes and the e-mail notes she was inputting back to GP.

3) Amanda will try to get into the billing department to find out if GP can get a discounted bill for having lost phone jack access for 22 days.

GP was at home from 12:00Noon until 2:00pm (making these calls) and left at 2:00pm. When she got back from work at 6:00pm, there was a "Sorry we missed you" card on the door and the ticket was closed in Sprint's computer system at 3:30pm. No one had used GP's "Must Call" cell phone number at all.

6:00pm - 6:15pm - GP calls NCSC to report the no show and non-use of Must Call number.

Put on hold for 15 minutes and was disconnected to a fast busy signal.

6:18pm - 6:36pm - GP was told that the hold time would be 5 minutes but it actually turned out to be 18 minutes.

NCSC CSR: Cheri

Cheri verified that the tech closed the ticket at 3:30pm, rescheduled a new appt for the next day #1623753, and promised to escalate the issue to her manager. She also clarified that a regular phone installer technician had been sent, not a DSL installer.

1/20/05 Rescheduled Residential Phone Jack troubleshoot/repair.

GP was contacted 2x in the morning by Cheri and by Jane. They had gotten through to the Ft Myers office and were trying to verify the time that the rep would be out tomorrow. GP said that the rep was rescheduled for today! So they went back and tried again. At 1:30pm the technician, Robert, called and GP was in a work crisis. So GP asked if he could meet her at the apartment at 3:30pm. He agreed and actually showed up at 4:00pm. Robert determined that the phone jack was fine and that GP's actual phone was old and had worn out pins in the plug in.

GP bought a new phone that night and used it that night.

1/22/05 - 1/26/05 Two days after replacing her phone, GP tried to make a residential phone calls and there was no dial tone at either phone jack in the apartment. GP did not call because she was exhausted with calling Sprint.

03/18/05 Credit for No Residential Phone Service

CSR: Merica

Merica will adjust the account for $10.20 (6.20 pro-rated lost dial tone days + 4.00 late fee). GP will pay the bill minus the $10.20. It will take 2-3 billing cycles to appear on the bill as a past due credit.

04/27/05 Earthlink sent a note saying it does not know who I am so it is terminating my service. [Later CSR: Chris said the Earthlink e-mail is a fraud but GP never received a warning note from Earthlink to save her the hassle of having to investigate it.  

CSR: Michelle  877-677-7596 

1) GP responded to the fraudulent e-mail twice and both responses came back undeliverable 

2) GP sent e-mail request for help to Sprint from the website and received no response.

3) GP came home at lunch and found her residential svc was down. It came back up while she was sitting there, so she called Sprint's National Customer Status Center.

4) GP told Michelle about the sex talk number replacing the Sprint PCS Help number and told her a recap of that issue but understands that Michelle at Sprint Residential cannot do anything about that.

Subject: Problem with the National Guard

Not long ago I sent you a letter expressing concern about a problem I had with the National Guard.  I have yet to receive a response and was wondering if you would take the time and reply.  I am a veteran of the US Army and the Florida National Guard and I feel that I was treated wrongly by a representative of the guard.  Enclosed is the original letter sent for your review.

 

Thank you,

 

Theresa Williams

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of Florida
The Capitol, 400 S. Monroe St.
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush:

As an adult voter of Florida, I strongly encourage you to SUPPORT the wine direct shipping language currently included in Senate Bill 906 (Dockery) and House Bill 975 (Bogdanoff). 

Among the 24 states that still ban interstate, direct-to-consumer wine shipments, Florida is the second largest as measured by wine enjoyment. 

Unfortunately, the $32 billion wine wholesaler cartel has aggressively defended their state-sanctioned monopolies in wine distribution in states like ours. Their rough tactics triggered a thorough study by the Federal Trade Commission in 2003, which concluded that shipment bans prevent consumers from saving as much as 21 percent on some wines and from conveniently purchasing many popular wines from wineries around the country. And the FTC's survey of alcohol regulators in 11 states with provisions for direct shipping found "no evidence suggesting direct shipping increases underage access."

These findings were consistent with previous sworn testimony by state alcohol regulators as well as anecdotal evidence in states with long-standing, pro-consumer direct shipment provisions. 

Please remember what you were elected to do – to serve and protect the rights of your constituents, not the special interests of the wholesaler cartel!  I'm not fooled by their cynical use of the real issue of underage access; it is a smoke screen for economic protectionism. 

Don't let special interests dilute the Free the Grapes! bills. Join wine lovers like me, Florida's family owned wineries, the majority of states, and the FTC in supporting legal, regulated wine direct shipping. Regardless of how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on this issue, you should take action now.  

Please let me know if you plan to support wine direct shipping, and your constituents.  Thank you.

Sincerely,


Lloyd Beale Jr

Governor  Jeb Bush 

Cuando llegue a este pais hace tres  años, me encontraba desesperada, pues en mi pais Colombia me habia graduado de Ingeniera Industrial y de hecho tenia buen trabajo, pero por motivos de violencia en mi pais tuve que emigrar a Estados Unidos buscando protección, por lo cual hice una solicitud de asilo politico, la cual me fue aprobada.

Despues de seis meses  de estar en este pais, me preguntaba  si no existian organizaciones que pudieran ayudarme a mi y a mi esposo  a encontrar trabajo en alguna empresa, claro anhelando el bienestar que tenia en mi pais, la dura realidad es que todas las puertas se me cerraban, hasta que un dia encontre en el directorio el nombre de Hispanic Unity of Florida una organizacion que se dedica a ayudar a los hispanos en el condado de Broward.

 Al llegar a las oficinas de Hispanic Unity, un consejero  me ayudo con mi depresion y le consiguio un buen trabajo a mi esposo y actualmente ya lleva dos años trabajando en ese sitio, permitiendole tambien  estudiar y progresar cada dia con el Ingles. Yo decidi trabajar como voluntaria en esta organizacion, pues senti como si estuviera trabajando en mi pais, al igual que muchos inmigrantes sienten cuando llegan a Hispanic Unity. Siendo voluntaria por un periodo de un mes me ofrecieron una posicion de Data Entry. He estado trabajando para Hispanic Unity por 1 ano y medio, en le cual he tenido la oportunidad de superarme y fui promovida a la posicion de Management Information Specialist para el programa REEP ( Refugee Entrant Employment Services, funded by DCF) ademas de pertenecer a los comites de Tecnologia y participar en el proceso de certificacion de Broward County para Hispanic Unity. He tenido la oportunidad de ayudar a los inmigrantes que algun dia como yo, llegaron a este pasi en busca de nuevas oportunidades y una vida segura, estable, o como es conocido el sueño americano.

Estoy estudiando ingles en el Broward Community College gracias a las facilidades que Hispanic Untiy me da. Cada dia aprendo mas y espero pronto terminar mis estudios.

Gracias a Hispanic Unity tambien hace tres meses puede comprar mi casa, ya que  organizan seminarios en espanol  que me brindaron  la informacion para hacer la mejor compra.

Actualmente se nos notifico que este programa de Refugiados y Asilados no se les dara mas a esta organizacion, al ocurrir esto, cientos de refugiados e inmigrantes en general, dejaran de recibir el servicio y la ayuda que tanto se necesita al llegar a este pais por primera vez. Ademas esto ocasionara que un gran numero de personas pierdan su empleo. Al ser yo la encargada de procesar la informacion de las personas que logran obtener un trabajo con la ayuda de Hispanic Unity, y reportarla a DCF ( A traves de ORACLE), puedo decirle que desde Octubre del 2003 hasta Agosto del 2004 pudimos ayudar a aproximadamente a 400 personas a conseguir un empleo y poder ser autosuficientes. Han sido muchos los logros que hemos obtenido gracias al amor, el profesionalismo y la dedicacion que todos los empleados de Hispanic Untiy ponemos dia a dia en nuestro trabajo, por lo cual le pido su intervencion para que se reconsidere la decision de terminar con este programa. Le pido de la manera mas atenta nos ayude a seguir ayudando a nuestra comunidad.

Atentamente
