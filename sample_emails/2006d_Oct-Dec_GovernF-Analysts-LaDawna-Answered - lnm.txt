Governor Bush,
 
I would like to know what I can do to ensure the laws in effect are carried out regarding our illegal aliens.  We have them in my area in groves, building for the developers etc.  Our small businesses are suffering and they're costing us daily.  What can I do as a citizen to ensure the laws are enforced?  I live in Destin Florida and have off and on for 35 years.  I don't like what I'm seeing at all.  I would much rather direct our efforts into helping our own elderly!  
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Donna Johns

Subject:	Immigration to the United States

Dear Governor Bush,  I was just reading in the newspaper about the immigrants 
who landed on Longboat Key.  They will be allowed to stay in the US and be 
given the opportunity to live here.  I have a daughter who lives in New Zealand 
and is married to a man from New Zealand.  They have three american children 
and want to come to Florida to live.  Her husband, Todd Carpenter, was visiting 
in the US seven years ago.  His visa and green card expired but he didn't 
want to leave my daughter, so he stayed past the time he should have left.  The 
US Embassy in New Zealand is telling him that he will have to wait another 
three years to come back to the US because of this (They were honest and told the 
embassy that he had overstayed his welcome.)  They have filed a waiver and it 
has been sent to the US Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand for approval that they 
said could take years.  My son-in-law is a hardworking, honest, good man who has 
never been in trouble for anything.  It seems strange to me that these 
immigrants can illegally come to the US and be welcomed, when a man who has an 
American wife and three American children is having such a difficult and costly 
time coming here legally.  They already have a place to live in North Port and a 
job working for my nephew who owns a construction company.  I would greatly 
appreciate any help or advice you could give me concerning this matter.  Thank 
you and Happy Holidays.  Sincerely, Diane Thompson  P>S> My phone number is 
303-596-9818 and my email address is DiParris2@aol.com

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As your term draws to a close I want to thank you for the leadership you have provided in our great state.  You have made a difference in so many ways.  
I have been trying to reach your brother via e-mail with a request but understand that he will not receive the request and is certainly too busy to address it as such.
 
As you probably know, the desk in the Oval Office is made from the wood of the H.M.S. Resolute, a vessel that was retrieved by whalers from America for England.  They were successful in pulling it from the icebergs and returning it to England.  After it's retirement, England had several desks made from the wood.  One of which, is in the Oval Office.
 
My great, great uncle,  James M. Buddington, from New London, CT, commanded the bark GEORGE HENRY and found the HMS RESOLUTE while sailing in the Davis Straits.  It was returned to England and the rest is history.  Since I am in charge of our family genealogy I've been trying unsuccessfully for years to obtain a photo of your father and brother behind this desk to include with our family history.  We have been proud supporters of your family through the years and would be honored to have such historical photos.
 
Can you suggest who I can contact in Washington to help us make this reality.
 
Thank you for your time and may God richly bless you as you move to the next chapter in your life.  Hopefully one day, you will be in the Whitehouse too and leave your legacy on our country.
 
Merry Christmas and a Blessed New Year,
Gwen Sapp

Dear Govenor Bush,
 
Our homeschool group is preparing for the following play.  There is a part where the president of the United States gives a little speech through the radio.  We were wondering if you could ask your brother (President Bush),  to read the paragraph that's in bold letters.  If he can, and he can mail us a recording, our address is:
 
Amy's Christian Home School Network
3180 Burlington Drive
Orlando, FL  32837
 
We would greatly appreciate it if he could do this for us.  However, if this is something that he can not do, we'll understand.  And we apologize for taking your time.
 
God Bless,
Emily O'Neill

SKIT:

 

NARRATOR:  Imagine that the day is over and you’ve just arrived home.  You tune in your radio and you hear the following news:

 

Scene 1

Dad arrives home, empties his pockets on the side table and turns on the radio.

DAD:  Honey, I’m home.

MOM:  I’m in the kitchen!  I’ll be right there!

All three kids are on the dining room table)

CHILD 1:  Hey, Dad!  Guess what I got on my geometry test.

CHILD 2:  No, you gotta come and look at my project first, I did great!

CHILD 3:  (Gets up and kisses his Dad then shows him his paper)  Hi Dad!

DAD:  (Checking out Kyle’s work) Wow, Kyle, you did great!  I’m so proud of you.

CHILD 1 and 2:  (Twists their mouths, look at each other and start making fun of Kyle)

MOM:  Stop that, girls!

 

Music stops from the radio and the following news comes through.

RADIO 1: And now, some news from around the world: “In India, it’s been reported that several villagers have died suddenly and strangely, from a flu that has never been seen before.

 

NARRATOR:  You don’t think much about it.  However, the next day after coming home from church, you hear another radio spot.

 

Scene 2:

Everyone arrives home from church service.  Dad turns on the radio and background music is heard.

MOM:  What a wonderful service!

DAD:  I know.  Pastor Charles has been such a blessing to our family.  It’s amazing how the Lord uses him.  Did you see that lady and her daughter when they stood up and gave their lives to the Lord?  It was so touching to see both of them making that decision together!

MOM:  I agree.  It reminded me of the time when I asked the Lord into my life.  I cried during the entire service.  I felt like I had finally found what I’d been missing for so long!  (Looking at the children)  Okay kids, it’s time for bed.  You have school tomorrow.

CHILD 1:  Aww!  It’s only ten o’clock…

CHILD 2:  Yeah!

CHILD 1:  We haven’t even had our snacks yet!

CHILD 2:  Yeah!

CHILD 3:  I’m hungry.

CHILD 2:  Yeah!

 

MOM:  (Laughingly) Lisa, you really don’t need to agree with everything Tammy and Kyle says.  Besides with all the snacks you had at church, I think you’ve already had your entire week’s worth of snacks covered!   And didn’t we just eat at Riley’s?  Sheesh!  Dad’s going to have to get another job just to feed you guys!  (Looking lovingly, mom pauses then) Okay, go get ready for bed and I’ll prepare some fruit cups.

 

CHILD 1,2 & 3:  Yeah!  (Children run off)

RADIO 2:  This just in:  The flu in India has already claimed the lives of 30,000 villagers in the back hills of the Northeast area of the town of Nabul.  Scientists from the Center of Disease Control in Atlanta are headed to India tonight.  This strain has never been seen before and has many doctors scratching their heads.

 

NARRATOR:

By Monday morning it’s the lead story in the television.  You see, now the disease has spread to other countries.

 

Scene 3:

Everyone is sitting at the dinning room table enjoying their supper while the radio plays music in the background.

MOM:  Honey, can you pass me the milk.

CHILD 1:  Mom, Lisa has a crush on Michael.  I heard her telling Nancy at PE today.

CHILD 2:  Do not!

CHILD 1:  Do too!

CHILD 2:  Do not!  Mom, Tammy’s bugging me!  Tell her to stop!

CHILD 1:  Stop whining.  What do you think Michael’s going to think?

CHILD 2:  MOM!

CHILD 3:  (Laughs shaking his head and rolls his eyes)

DAD:  Girls, be quiet!  (Raises his index finger in a listening mode)

 

RADIO 1:  The disease has now spread to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China.  France announced the closing of their border this past Monday, but we are afraid that it’s already too late for them.  Several people have already begun to show symptoms of the disease.  It seems that this disease has already reached Europe!

RADIO 2:  Carl, can you tell us what the symptoms are?

MOM:  (Mom goes behind dad and puts her hands on his shoulders.  Dad pats her hand.)  

RADIO 1:  It seems that they’re not too sure, but from what we’ve heard, once you get it, you have it for a week before you know it.  Then you have four days of unbelievable symptoms, and then you die!

RADIO 2:  Oh my!  Do they kno…

RADIO 1:  Hold on Brenda.  Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States.  (Pause)

PRESIDENT:  My fellow Americans, I just got off the phone with Britain.  In an attempt to help control this disease, they have informed me that they have closed their borders this morning, but it seems that it’s too late.  I’ve been informed that the disease has already spread to South Hampton, Liverpool and North Hampton.  (pause & sigh)  I regret to say, that due to a national security risk, all flights to and from Europe and Asia have been canceled.  If your loved ones are over seas, I’m sorry (pause), they will not be allowed to come back until we find a cure for this disease.

(Mom and dad look at each other, mom puts her hand on her mouth)

 

NARRATOR:

Within four days our nation has been plunged into an unbelievable fear.  Can you imagine?  People are selling little face masks.  You can hear people asking, “What if it comes to America?”  Preachers are yelling, “It’s the wrath of God!”  But what they didn’t know is that it had already reached American soil.  For one night while mom and dad were reading the Bible, dad received a phone call from his mother.

 

Scene 4:

(Phone rings, mom gets it)

MOM:  Oh, Hi.  How’s everything going?  Sure, he’s right here.  Hold on a second. (mom covers the phone and faces dad)  Honey, it’s your mom.

DAD:  Thanks.  Hi mom. (pause) Uh-huh.  Okay, I’ll do it right now.  (Dad walks to the radio)

MOM:  You know James, I was thinking…(Dad lifts his finger in an act of telling her to listen)

RADIO 1:  (With a solemn voice)  We regret to inform you that this fateful disease has reached the United States.  Two women are lying in a Long Island hospital dying from this mysterious flu. 

(Mom and dad look at each other with concern)

 

NARRATOR:  Within hours it seems that this thing is just sweeping across the United States!  Scientists are working around the clock trying to find an antidote, but nothing works!  California, Arizona, Oregon, even Florida!  It’s as though it’s sweeping the entire nation!  Then all of a sudden, there’s some “good news”.

 

Scene 5:

Dad, with garden gloves, enters the house very excitedly.  Goes to the table and puts on the radio. Both of them have the sniffles and an all around “ill” appearance.

MOM:  James, what’s wrong?

DAD:  The code has been broken.

MOM:  What are you talking about?  The virus?

DAD:  Yeah!  They found a cure!  Scientists can now make a vaccine.  They’re going to start driving through the neighborhoods in a couple of hours, and when we hear the sirens go off, we need to go down to the hospital and have our blood drawn.

MOM:  How about the kids?

DAD:  Everyone!  They need to check us all!  They’re looking for a certain type of blood, from someone who hasn’t been infected.  (sniffles) Everyone’s talking about it!  Come on, let’s get ready.

MOM:  Okay.  I’ll go get them.

 

NARRATOR:  Sure enough, you hear the siren, and when you and your family get down to the hospital, there is a long line.  They’ve got doctors and nurses coming out and pricking everyone’s fingers, taking blood and putting labels on it.  Your wife and your kids are right there with you.

 

Scene 6:

NURSE 1:  (Pricks the fingers of the family.  Tammy and Lisa complain)

NURSE 2:  (With a clipboard)  Wait here in the parking lot and if we call your name, you can be dismissed and go home.

Mom places her head in her hands and dad tries to comfort her.

DOCTOR:  (All excitedly, with the clipboard on his hand)  Kyle Peterson, Kyle Peterson!!!

CHILD 3:  Dad, that’s me!

The doctor motions for Kyle to follow him and both start to leave.  

DAD:  Hey, wait a minute!  What’s going on?

DOCTOR 1:  It’s okay, his blood is clean, it’s pure.  We just want to make sure that he doesn’t have the disease.  We think he has the right type of blood.

After a couple of seconds, the doctor comes out.

DOCTOR 1:  Your son’s blood type is perfect.  It’s clean, it’s pure.  We can make the vaccine!

 

NARRATOR:  The doctors and nurses are crying and hugging one another, some are even laughing.  It’s the first time you’ve seen anybody laugh in a week.  As the word begins to spread all across the parking lot, you see people dancing, laughing, praying and crying.  Then all of a sudden, the doctor approaches you with a solemn voice.

 

Doctor calls dad aside and both begin to walk towards the hospital.

DOCTOR 2:  We didn’t know that the donor would be a minor, so we need you to sign a consent form.

Doctor shows dad the form and dad proceeds to sign, but he stops.

DAD:  H-how many pints of blood do you need?  It doesn’t specify.

DOCTOR 2:  We had no idea it would be a young child.  We weren’t prepared…..We need it all!

DAD:  But, but….

DOCTOR 2:  You don’t understand.  We are talking about the world here.  Please sign.  

DAD:  I can’t do this.  How do you expect me to allow you to kill my own son? 

DOCTOR 2:  Sir, if we need to call the authorities to approve this, we will.  Please understand!  I know how difficult this is for you, but the world is dying!

DAD:  But can’t you give him a transfusion?

DOCTOR 2:  If we had clean blood we would.  Can you, please?

In numb silence dad signs the paper.

DOCTOR 2:  Would you like to have a moment with him before we begin?

 

Scene 7:

Dad walks up to his son who is sitting on a table.

CHILD 3:  Hey Dad.  (Flexing his muscles and smiling)  Looks like I’m going to be the hero here, eh?  You can start calling me Superman!  (All of a sudden he notices his dad’s concerned look)  What’s going on?  

DAD:  Son, you know that I love you and I wouldn’t let anything happen to you that didn’t have to be.  Do you understand that?

CHILD 3:  (With a concerned look)  Sure, Dad???

DOCTOR:  (Walking back into the room)  I’m very sorry, we’ve got to get started.  People all over the world are dying.

 

NARRATOR:  (Standing up and taking the middle of the stage)  Can you leave?  Can you walk back in that room while he is saying, “Father, Father?  Why have you forsaken me?   Can you allow your son to give up his life so that others can live?  Thieves, murderers, drug addicts…

 

Well, somebody has already done that, and His name is Jesus Christ.  Jesus came to this world and gave His life so that those who believe in Him can live an everlasting life.

 

Let’s bow down our heads and thank God for His awesome love.  And if you haven’t met the Lord, I encourage you to ask Him to come into your life while we pray.  All you have to do is ask for forgiveness and invite Him into your life!

 

Let’s pray.  Father, seeing it from Your eyes breaks our hearts.  Maybe now we can comprehend the great love that you have for us.  Please continue to love us and guide us in your ways.  Do not let us wander.  And Father, if there is someone who hasn’t met you here today, I ask that you touch that person with your Holy Spirit.  Thank you Lord for always loving us.  Amen.

 

MOM:  (Walking to the left of NARRATOR as if reading the Bible) For God so loved us that He gave His only begotten Son so that we could be saved…

DAD:  (Walking to the right of NARRATOR) Thank you for joining us today.  May God Bless all of you!

My Aunt Percide Jean-Claude is being deported back to Haiti, after not consulting with the immigration service. My aunt has been here more than 10 years with 2 small children (10 and 7 years old) and they love her soo much. And I cant bare to see them grow up without a mother, because I never had a father growing up. My uncle who resides here in the states as a citizen, is devastated that his only love is going away. She’s been paying taxes working two jobs a week for years now, and its all been good. From what I have heard of is that her sentence may be up to 20 years. (and think 20 years is a long time) this is probably the nicest person you would ever meet in your whole life. Always putting smiles on everyone’s Faces, trying to cheer them up. And she won't be able to do this on Haiti because of all the political, economic and social problems they have there. There are reported dozens of kidnapping each month, manslaughter, thievery.. and as you probably know the government is falling apart. Haiti is the poorest country in the Caribbean 80 percent of the population is unemployed. She left Haiti because of all of this, she bought a house and car with the earnings she had earned here .All my aunt wants to do this take care of her 2 beautiful kids and love her dear husband. Can please help me?

Dear Governor Bush:

 am a Veteran of the Gulf war and the current war in Iraq. I joined when I 
was 17 and continued to serve untill I was medically discharged in 2005 
for a total of 17 years of service. I recieved a disability rating of 50%. 
I was surprised to find out that I could no longer shop at the Exchange or 
Commisary when I recently went to visit my sister in Mayport, Florida. Her 
husband is a Chief Petty Officer in the Navy. I did some research and 
found that I would have to be 100% Disabled to have that benifit. If I was 
not injured in Iraq I would have continued to serve and retire. If my 
enlistment wasn't cut 3 years short because of my injuries sustained in 
combat I could have retired and been able to shop at the Exchange. I just 
feel shorted. Well I hope this is read and would like to see some changes 
to allow Combat Disabled Veterans the same benifits as retirees. Thank You.

Sincerely,

Dearest Jeb,
Can I please ask one last big favor before you go out of office? National House of Hope has invited the First Lady to receive a special Healing America's Teens Award at our banquet January 13th at the Rosen Centre. We would love to have the President and First Lady there. Would you please help us by doing what you can? By having one of them there would give us the visibility we need to get Houses of Hope all across America. Presently, we have 69 Houses of Hope patterned after House of Hope Orlando across the national and one international. Will you please help me in this to save this hurting generation, our leaders of tomorrow? Kitty Martinez is on my National Board, and is also helping me with this. My cell phone is 407-234-4823.
I love you!

I was called by the building department and told that my side neighbor must be partially disabled because she only gets the $500 disability deduction from her property tax. However, after looking at their website and checking the form to apply for the deduction, form attached, it is clear that the $500 disability exemption form deduction are for those who are completely disabled requiring a wheel chair. My side neighbor does not use a wheel chair, walks normally and can lift and do yard work. I have a video of this and they have a side business which they advertise in the community bulleton or flyer. Ive given this video to the social security administration but it seems to have been lost. Id like to hand deliver it. Note the advertisement for Total Home Care.  Ive also attached a building permit application with Nancy Pearlmutters social security number. Note that she uses the same phone number as Total Home Care. Her property record online shows her folio and that she is getting the $500 deduction for those who are fully disabled which she is not.

Honorable Governor Bush,

By way of introduction, you honored me with the privilege of an appointment to serve on the Florida Real Estate Appraisal Board in February 2000 and a re-appointment in February 2004. I have served through my term of October 31, 2006 and will continue to do so until replaced or re-appointed.  

This is short notice and please do not fault me for trying...

My family and I are traveling to Wash, DC next week (Dec 26 through Jan 1) and would love to tour the Capitol and/or White House.  

Is this at all possible? 

With deep appreciation,

Subject:	Naturalization Oath

Recently, I went to naturalization interview in Jacksonville for citizenship and took my test and passed.  I am now waiting to take the oath.  I was approved on the 14th and was really excited about being naturalized this year and be an American.  The problem is Pensacola had their last on for the year on the 17th on November.  Is there anyway that Governor Bush can help me.  I will travel anywhere in Florida or elsewhere, to take the oath.  I can't seem to get through to anyone in INS.  I guess she assigned me to Pensacola because I live in Fort Walton but this is a dream come true for me, my son just joined the US Army and I am so proud of him that I would like for him to see me being naturalized.  He'll be home until January 2 before he leaves.  Is there a schedule that shows if there's one I can attend in the state of Florida, and if so how can I participate in that ceremony.

Dear Governor Bush,
    
      Doris M. Sanchez (on the left in the picture) has been a member of our Dental Team for just shy of 2 years.  She is an immigrant from Columbia.  She has a work permit and a Social Security number.  Her greatest desire in life is to receive her Green Card. She had been in pursuit of the dream for many years. Her English is impeccable, and she is teaching us phrases of Spanish on a daily basis.
    Last month she received an invitation for an "interview" by the Immigration Office in Tampa.  We were all thrilled for her as she felt that she was getting one step closer to her dream.  It was with heartfelt excitement that we all wished her well for her interview and celebrated the moment .
     When she arrived for her "Interview" she was informed that she had missed a court appearance, and was immediately arrested. She NEVER received any notice of this mystery court appearance. She  is being held in  the Pompano Beach detention center.  Her family is in the process of selling many of their possessions to try to afford to help her. (Including their car)
     Doris is a full time employee for us, and attends Edison Community College Full time at the night. She is studying Pre-Dental to hopefully apply to Dental School when she is able.  This young lady is brilliant and will achieve her goals if she is given the chance to. 
     Immigration has done us all a disservice. She is no threat to our county, and is the type of immigrant that our country was built on.  I beg of you to  PLEASE help her. 
   Her information is:   Doris Mercedes Sanchez
                                     8205 Mossborger Ave.

Dear Governor Bush, My husband SSG Brian Palso is currently serving in Iraq with Charlie Company 2/505th P.I.R. 82nd Airborne Division. He is trying to update his ERB for selection to promotion to SFC in the year 2007. The cutoff date for the records is 12 January 2007, the problem that he is having is there is an incorrect DIEMS date on record which is keeping his unit from making necessary corrections. He has e-mailed Home of Records in Indianapolis twice in the last 17 days and there has been no reply and no correction to records currently DIEMS date states 1999/ 05/ 05 it should read 1993/05/05.  He is serving our country overseas for the second time why can’t his record, this date be changed by those who are sitting in their offices here and have the ability to see their families at night. Thier only job is to maintain these records why can this matter not be taken care of in a timely fashion instead of doing this route and involving you, the Governor. 13 years of service without complaint and has always had excellent NCO evaluations reviews. This is a time sensitive matter and time is running out and if anyone deserves the same fair chance and opportunity as everyone it is SSG Palso, he has faithfully for two previous years trained future soldiers being a Drill Sgt at Ft Jackson S.C. prior to returning to the 82nd Airborne Division again. The requests have been e-mailed to this e-mail address pab_diems@erec.army.mil . The first e-mail was all the required documents stating the correct date on his DD Form 4 and the second was a request on the status of this change. Please assist us in any way with this matter.  SSG and Mrs Palso

REGIONAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE

Congressman Ric Keller (Via alternative E-mail)
Governor Jeb Bush
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

My name is Charles Schmidt, and I am writing this letter, in an attempt to get some kind of assistance, THIS IS MY LAST DESPARATE ATTEMPT FOR HELP.  I am writing this letter concerning Maria T. Sturrock,  whose social security Number is [REDACTED] and myself.  The reason I am writing this letter is because we have several problems that at this point require the assistance of these federal organizations.
 
In January of 1998, James Lawrence Sturrock, preceded her in death, and was a veteran of World War II...upon his death we attempted then, to apply for financial benefits of the Veterans administration-NOTHING EVER CAME OF THAT.  At that time Maria was still in good health, and worked part time.  She however was not able to pay her bills with social security benefits from Jim's social security alone approximately $470.00 per month.
 
Now after several attempts at getting her assistance through out the years, NOTHING was ever accomplished.  She owned a home she had to sell due to the expense, she was not eligible for any benefits at that time as she still owned a car.  I am a little concerned, as I now see how the elderly can ever so quickly fall into the cracks.  In 2004 I assisted her in requesting again additional financial aid, as I have been assisting her now for nearly 5 years. I then with the advice of an attorney added her to the deed of my property located at 6303 Goethe St. #102 Orlando, FL 32835. My financial situation is now taken a turn for the worst, as sometime since the purchase of the home and placing her on the deed, we have been both victims of identity theft!!!!  In March of this year, a second mortgage was taken out in her name alone in the amount of $83,000.00 something neither her nor myself new anything about, and have documentation to prove it.  Although no mortgage company, or title company could or would assist us.  I finally with no help from any of the consumer protection agencies all I could do was put an alert on our credit.  THIS DID LITTLE GOOD!!  Currently the house is facing foreclosure,  as this was the only course of action that could be taken since, no one would assist us at any level of government.  
 
I have had all I can do to take care of her.  On September 21, 2006, Maria fell and broke her hip, had a complete replacement.  While she has been recovering satisfactorily, I am concerned for her future, and now mine.
 
 I am no longer able to pay all of the additional expenses.  She hasn't had a vehicle in almost 6 months, and has no assets to speak of, however she somehow remained ineligible for any programs, houseing assistance, drug programs, etc.  Since I have made countless phone calls regarding Medicare A-B-D, Medigap, SHINE, etc., I am still not any further.  I today submitted a request for additional financial aid for her medicines have now become something I cannot afford to refill.  We unfortunately had a lapse of her Physician Mutual Insurance, and now they will not reinstate.  This is probably the worst time in her life. So much for the golden years.  If someone could please contact me and once and for all assist me in getting this matter fixed, I would appreciate it.  I have never had so much trouble trying to help someone in my life.  I see how the complicated paperwork can be confusing to say the least, and especially for a 77 year old woman who doesn't have any idea why she has no government assistance accept for $538.00 a month social security......not even enough for food.

PLEASE HELP!!!!
Sincerely,
Charles Schmidt                Maria T. Sturrock

In 1954  I applied for immigration  for two sisters I have living in Iraq . Finally after years of waiting they were advised to come for visa interview.My sister Wafa  Naman  was given a date for November 5th, 2006   and Faiza Naman, my older ister, who is  72  years old  , a date for March 19, 2007,  without any consideration for how difficult it is for anybody to make the trip from Baghdad to Amman . My sister Wafa took the bus to Amman ,leaving my other sister back  in Baghdad. She did her visa interview and was told that they will let her know in few weeks.She has been waiting since  November 5th to hear from them,and is becoming very desperate not knowing whether she should return to  Baghdad or stay and  wait ,while being  worried about my other sister who is 72 years old . Could you please help facilitate their immigration. We are christian family, in the spirit of this holly season , and good will,  I ask for your help.

I am currently serving in the United States Air Force stationed at Robins AFB, GA.  I have been working on my instrument and commercial rating through the aero club on base. I'm trying to use my MGIB to help with the costs associated with my flight training.  I initial sent in my paperwork to the VA and received a notice dated February 22, 2006 stating they received my application for benefits. I unfortunately was subsequently deployed. Upon my return I was told I would have to reaccomplish the paperwork and resubmit. I did this on Sep. 06, 2006 via fax, as I was instructed to do by the VA representative (Lynda). I have not heard from the VA to this date. My concern is that every time I try to call the VA (1-888-GI-BILL1) I either get a message that all agents are busy and that I'm going to be discounted, or if I’m lucky enough to reach someone, the answer is that it should be completed in 2 weeks.  This has been the answer for the last month and a half.  I’ve had to put my training on hold do to insufficient monies.  I will likely have to spend additional time and money to complete my training.  I also deployed on a regular basis (every six months) and have a short window of opportunity to get any type of training/education done. I feel this is not the type of serve our veterans deserve. Is this anyway to serve a customer? Is this an acceptable response? Thank for your time.

Dear Governor Bush;

 

Given that you have a very special relationship withn President Bush I thought maybe you could help.  I am representing a Canadian Recording Artist Melanie Dekker. She has recently performed for President William Clinton (please do not let that deter you from reading further or listening to her song) as well as shows with Faith Hill and Diana Krall. (you may find her Bio etc is on my website at (www.melaniedekker.com ) .

 

I never understood the significance of the song Wounded Soldier until I started corresponding with many of the soldiers currently in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In speaking with them I realized that Melanie had truly tapped into the heart and soul of these men when she wrote Wounded Soldier. It is not just about being physically wounded in a war but also about the frustrations they feel because of the craziness and evil they are battling.   I’m sure this sounds ridiculous, but I think it would be great if this could be the official song of the Iraqi war.  We are ALL so proud of our guys, their courage, strength and fortitude to make the world a safer place to live.  They need our support, and sometimes its just the touch of the heart string to bring people back to a cause. Music has that ability!!!

 

She wrote the song for the Wounded Solder campaign a few years ago. It has just been released on her new album titled "REVEALED" which was officially available to the public since the launch on the USS Hornet at the end of September. Here is a document of one of the press releases at that time: 

 

http://www.acountry.com/music/melanie_decker_cd_sales_to_benefit_wounded_troops.html

 

Through CD sales, together with her record label she is donating $2 our soldiers.

 

Equally important of course, she really wants to get her SONG "wounded soldier" and MUSIC to your soldiers and their families. It is about healing with LOVE.  Melanie would like to perform this song and/or get it to as many of our troops as possible (She will sign and send photos on arranged request as well!) 

 

Kind wishes for all those who view this email.

 

You can listen to her entire cd at or we will be happy to forward the song to you via email in mp3 format.

 

  "REVEALED". Feel it:

My future daughter in law is trying to get a visa out of Kazakhstan. She had an appointment with the American Embassy yesterday & the attorney that my son hired in Naples dropped the ball & didn't send all the paperwork. I am now sending what they need to my son in FL & he will express mail it to Kazakhstan but it will take days to get there. We had hoped she would be here for Christmas & they even took a step in faith & bought her ticket. Now it looks like that might not be possible. Is there anything you can do to help?
 
thank  you for anything you can do even if it only to pray for the situation.

I have been trying to find a Medicare dentist, I find to many problems in finding consistent policy,
the Medicare transport is not consistent in policy. one day they said they transport for dental exams, today  they have changed to dental extractions only. I cant abide in this new Medicare system, the policy is changing daily. so as one of my last resorts is contacting the governor of my state for clarification on Medicare transport policy in my state, I know your on your way out of official duties as governor, but having a consistent policy in Medicare reform is required, and it would be a feather in your cap if you could bring consistency to the remaining term of governor, as well as being a model or prototype for others states in following suit.

Greetings, My Name is Andrea Hansen.  
I am writing you in concern to our Social Security system.  April of 2001 my husband Bryan was injured at work.  We are currently "fighting" our lovely workman's' compensation system.  However, my concerns are with the SSA.  

Bryan applied several times for disability assistance.  September 06 we were finally granted full benefits.  
Judge Barbara C. Marquardt was very concerned and apologetic that the system did not work properly for Bryan.   Needless to say, she wanted his case expedited since she knew that we were mistreated from the beginning.. 

 Sixty days later, we received his first payment and backpay that was to be for 4 years.  Sadly mistaken AGAIN it was incorrect.  Bryan went to our local office in Port St. Lucie.   After sitting there for 4 hours, he was able to finally speak to someone who knew what they were doing.  She basically reviewed Bryan's file and found that they had the incorrect date, incorrect workman's' comp information and they didn't show that we have 2 children.  We are waiting a payment of $35,000 plus.  She said that she would expedite the file to the Baltimore office and we should receive the payment by December 13th.  ( his birthday is May 5th)

Well, we received our payment today however it’s the original $1045 not the $1701 plus the back pay of $35,000.  As you can see my concerns are we are due over $35,000…….

Bryan contacted the local office again and was basically told that the file is still sitting there and they would get to it.  This upsets us considering it was the administrations mistake that we are basically being "back burnered".  

Is there anyone that can expedite this file?  Why are we at the mercy of waiting on someone to do their job that our tax dollars are paying for?  It's not fair to us that we should be at that mercy considering it's the administrations mistake.    Now here again, we are waiting on the administration to correct it.  

As I said, we have 2 children, it's the holidays…..  Now we are still waiting for them to pay up….  
Certainly if someone in the administration office was waiting on $35,000 they would be making sure  they were paid.  Why are we any different?  What can be done ? 

Please advise.  We are patiently waiting.  Thank you for you assistance

Subject:	dont even know why I bother to write

My mother seems to think its a good idea to write you.. Why I dont know b/c I know you nor anyone in the government gives a care... Anyways my husband is in the military he has been to Iraq 2 times already Korea and is doing his 2nd deployment to saudi as we speak.. I have the insurance for the military which sucks! I have having surgery Thursday and I have 2 choices to either go tricare standard (which when I do my IVF and it works I have to pay alot out of pocket for my pregnancy after paying over 8,000 dollars for my IVF that tricare wont cover) Or I can do wants called Point of service  and pay 50 % of my surgery so I can keep prime and be able to afford being pregnant.. But how do I afford the average cost of ovarian drilling is 40,000 dollars.. How does a military family afford that.. The doctor is part of Tricares network but tricare says they wont cover him b/c he is over 100 miles away.. Wow my husband can go to war???? and we arent aloud to have children b/c we have infertility.. My husband is the only son! Only way to provide his family with an heir.. But guess what we cant afford it.. But hey why would you care you have money and power.. My husband and I dont have shit but I can just sit here and need a surgery and cant do it b/c If I switch to standard then I can afford being pregnat due to paying the cost of IVF..  Anyways I have 12 hours to figure out what I am going to do to have the chance of being a mother and my husband having the chance of being a father.. I cant do my IVF unless i have this surgery which tricare does cover but just wont b/c its over 100 miles..

Well now that my injury has gotten so bad I can't work I can't seem to get any help from anyone, I applied to SS and was turned down even tho my Drsw wrote that I was unable to work due to my condition and mental state, I ask for a hearing and agian was turned down.
So I am asking you what can I do? Who will help me now, I can't work and my wife is having a hard time keeping us going, I live in a poor trailer and do the best we can but its not good enough anymore.
So now I am asking you, man to man, for help, You are more than welcome to come to my home and see what I am saying is true. I hope that I will at least get something back from you even if its just a tought luck I cant help you letter.

Subject:	Is this Senate Bill correct?

To the Honorable Governor of the State of Florida:

The following is an email letter I received from an associate. It may be a facetious attempt to highlight an issue of Senate activity. I’m not aware of the Senate’s passing of such a bill; however, if one was passed and the letter writer is correct in his presumptions then I dare say someone needs to intercede.

Dear Elected Official, 

As an American citizen and excellent customer of the Internal Revenue Service, I am writing to ask for your assistance. I have contacted the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to determine the process for becoming an illegal alien and they referred me to you. 
My primary reason for wishing to change my status from U.S. Citizen to illegal alien stem from the bill which was recently passed by the Senate. If my understanding of this bill's provisions is accurate, as an illegal alien who has been in the United States for five years, all I need to do to become a citizen is to pay a $2,000 fine and income taxes for three of the last five years. I know a good deal when I see one and I am anxious to get the process started before everyone figures it out. 
Simply put, those of us who have been here legally have had to pay taxes every year so I'm excited about the prospect of avoiding two years of taxes in return for paying a $2,000 fine. Is there any way that I can apply to be illegal retroactively? This would yield an excellent result for me and my family because we paid heavy taxes in 2004 and 2005. 
Additionally, as an illegal alien I could begin using the local emergency room as my primary health care provider. Once I have stopped paying premiums for medical insurance, my accountant figures I could save almost $10,000 a year. Another benefit in gaining illegal status would be that my daughter would receive preferential treatment relative to her law school applications, as well as "in-state" tuition rates for many colleges throughout the United States for my son. 
Lastly, I understand that illegal status would relieve me of the burden of renewing my driver's license and making those burdensome car insurance premiums. This is very important to me given that I still have college age children driving my car. 
If you would provide me with an outline of the process to become illegal (retroactively if possible) and copies of the necessary forms, I would be most appreciative. Thank you for your assistance. 
Your Loyal Constituent, 




Yours Respectfully

Subject:	filing for disability

Hello Governor.  I have concerns about the process involved for filing for disability.
My mother, Gail Phillips, has worked for years with health conditions that have hindered her work performance.  However, one year ago, she had a stroke. She has not worked since that time and has filed for her disability twice with her assigned MD agreement.  Her last notice stated it would be up to 18 months before she could go before the judge over her claim. 
This is wrong.  She has already been out of work for a year, drawing no income and has had an MD approve her disability twice already.  She has worked full time as a Registered Nurse for 30 years and can't even get the help she needs and deserves.  What do think about this situation?

Governor Bush
You maybe our last hope in a fight to right a unjust . My son is in the 
military and has been for the last ten years serving his
country.  He has been to Kuwait, Korea and Iraq, each time doing our 
country proud .
Let me cut to the chase. During his tour in Iraq, he was exposed to 
incoming mortar rounds and as a result lost 50% of his
hearing in both ears. At the moment he is stationed at Fort Carson, Co. 
and is about to be sent back to Iraq for a second tour on December 20.
Now I ask you, why are we sending our disabled in to combat ? Are we 
that hard up for troops? The military, in its own warped
wisdom seems to think that not being able to hear is not a disability.I 
really don"t think that you or any other father would want
this action to take place .

Please don"t ignore this and send me back a form letter.
We has even contacted Senator Martinez about this matter but still 
nothing has changed .

Subject:	Disabled and being denied medicare-part-B

Governor Bush, I do not make it a practice  to plead to the ones in control..I have tried since April of 2006 To instate my Medicare part- B . To which I have been in tilted to since June of 2001...I was married at the time I became disabled..I became disabled by having 5 broken necks between 1998-2001 it took me hiring a lawyer to fight for my benefits that should have started in 1998. I finally was awarded my $739.00 in the year 2001.and of course the lawyer took most of that..that's not the problem... now this is...
My husband and I are now divorced and his company no longer wanted to cover my health benefits..so they dropped me in April 2006 When I began my battle with Social Security..I applied for Medicare part-B at that point...after them investigating all these months..what ever they where investigating..you see when I was married I DID NOT WANT TO BURDEN THE GOVERNMENT WITH MY MEDICAL COVERAGE ...So instead, I kept my husbands coverage through his employer's ( note I said employers)
That's where the web of confusion falls in...you see my husband was (is) a high profile consultant and he is bid ed for his work so he may be with a company a year or even 4-5 years..so that said I explained to them once they summoned all start to finish dates from his previous employers..they stated to me there was COBRA involved..I stated yes, of course, when my husband would go from position to another he would always keep the insurance coverage we had through the employer he was leaving to keep us fully insured..this period would only last a few days.He was never under what they call a thirty-ninety day waiting period for his benefits to begin. Now if he was hired on the 15th of a month for example. by the 1st of the following month the benefits went into action immediately..
But, I was told just this pass week by the supervisor of this social security office that I did not qualify for medicare part-B at this point because there was a break of company coverage when he changed jobs..we DO NOT except Cobra as insurance it MUST be company coverage..arguing to no avail..that Cobra was company coverage... we just paid for it...
at the end of the conversation with this Lady..I was informed that not only am I not eligible for medicare part -B coverage NOW but I will also be penalized..for all the years I was eligible for it by 10% each year and I have to apply under general admission starting in Jan.2007 and my benefits will NOT begin until JULY 2007...unbeliveable...I am being 1st off denied as a disabled American citizen. 2nd I am being penalized by 60% for not burdening my government with my medical coverage when at the time my husbands employment covered me as part of his benefits..I worked 35yrs in Medicine..My husband was a Green Berte in the U.S. Army.
while I was waiting in the waiting area, I just happen to notice all of the people that was there, that had received these very benefits That I as a U.S. citizen.was being denied..Many of them never worked a day in their lives in this country, lest go to war for this country...
I guess what I'm saying to you Mr Bush...who on earth would pass a law or bill that made the disabled uncover able for Medicare part -B because they didn't burden their country with that responsibility for as long as they could carry it on there own..
Please help!!!!! me to gain the benefits I have been entitled to since 2001.with out such penalties..I can't afford them..the office that I have been dealing with is the PORT RICHEY office of Pasco county..A lady by the name of Ms. Chamberline has all records of my case. The phone number there is 1800-772-1213  I have scanned the document that they gave me, for you to see what they told me... why I was not eligible..I hope to hear from you..that you will HELP!!!! me...
 
Thank You For Your Attention To This Matter..

Dear Governor Bush:

Please Support
Access to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Services Improvement Act 
(S.3963)

I am an ATHLETIC TRAINING student.  Athletic trainers are health care 
professionals educated and trained in the prevention, assessment, 
treatment and rehabilitation of injuries and illnesses. There are almost 
7,400 athletic training students and a total of 30,000 certified athletic 
trainers working in high schools, colleges, hospitals, clinics and 
academia. Athletic trainers in the U.S. treat an estimated 16 million 
patients each year and are an essential part of the health care system.

The ability of athletic trainers to provide care has been impeded by an 
unfair policy rule made by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) in July 2005. This "incident to" ruling restricts health care 
providers from referring their patients to athletic trainers, lymphedema 
therapists, and others. This drastically limits a patient's ability to 
choose who they see for medical treatment. By cosponsoring S.3963, the 
Access to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Services Improvement Act, 
and pressing for its speedy vote and passage, you can help to improve 
access to quality health care services provided by athletic trainers and 
other therapists for Medicare beneficiaries.  It will also restore the 
ability of physicians to choose who can help them deliver these services 
in their office.  

Athletic trainers work under a physician's direction in providing 
medically necessary health care services. This bill lifts artificial and 
arbitrary restrictions on athletic trainers as health care professionals 
and allows athletic trainers to treat all patients within their scope of 
practice.  All athletic trainers hold bachelor's degrees and 70 percent 
have master's or doctoral degrees.  All certified athletic trainers must 
pass a national board exam to become certified.

Please cosponsor S.3963.  Join athletic trainers in our fight to keep the 
quality of health care high by empowering our patients and physicians to 
have freedom in their medical care options.  

Sincerely,


Lauren Miller

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of Florida
The Capitol, 400 S. Monroe St.
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001


Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Sir,

   We are emergency physicians in Florida.  I am the medical director of 
the adult emergency department at Tampa General Hospital, the trauma 
center for the Tampa area.  I am also the residency director for the 
emergency medicine residency program.  My wife is also an emergency 
physician at Tampa General and education director for the University of 
South Florida emergency medicine program and medical students. In our work 
at Tampa General Hospital and for the University of South Florida, we are 
at the forefront of our patient's medical needs and intimately involved in 
the education of the students and physicians who will care for them in the 
future.  We are affiliated with TeamHealth. TeamHealth is one of the 
largest physician organizations in the United States and 
TeamHealth-affiliated physicians will treat over 1,200,000 Medicare 
patients in 2006.TeamHealth serves 470 hospitals and clinics in 44 states 
and contracts with over 5,000 emergency department physicians, physician 
assistants and nurse practitioners.  The work of these clinicians is 
supported by over 2,000 administrative employees across the United States. 
  My colleagues and I are all extremely concerned with the scheduled 
Medicare physician payment reductions in 2006 and beyond. In fact, a 5.1% 
reduction in the Medicare fee schedule will reduce payments to emergency 
room physicians by over $6.00 per patient encounter.  Like any other 
business subject to increased costs of doing business and inflation, we 
cannot withstand continued reductions in our practice revenues.

   Emergency physicians provide care to millions of uninsured patients 
each year. Much of this care is uncompensated. In addition, we care for 
millions of Medicaid patients, due in many cases to these patients' lack 
of access to appropriate care from both primary and specialty care 
physicians. The Medicare payments we receive support what has increasingly 
become a very fragile safety net.  

   TeamHealth and its physicians have worked for many years with the 
Emergency Department Practice Management Association (EDPMA) and the 
American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) in support of emergency 
medicine. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently published a series of 
reports on the state of emergency care in our nation, and they paint a 
grim picture. The IOM has urged Congress that "the emergency care system 
requires a special funding source, separate from the regular DSH formula, 
to adequately compensate hospitals and physicians for the burden of 
providing services to uninsured and underinsured populations."

   In the absence of Congressional or Executive action, Medicare payment 
rates for all physicians will fall by approximately 5.1% in January of 
2007. This is due to a "flawed" formula within the Medicare physician 
payment system. Resolution of this issue needs to occur during the 
upcoming Lame Duck Session of Congress.  I urge you to take action by 
passing legislation that will avert this reduction in 2007 and find a long 
term solution to the Sustainable Growth Rate formula dilemma.

   Emergency physicians work every day to improve the quality of care 
delivered in our communities.  As part of that effort, TeamHealth has an 
established dialogue with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) in order to participate in pay-for-performance (P4P) initiatives and

Dear Gov. Bush,
I have written my senator with no help.  I have waited for the appication answer for social security for over six months for disability, to which I just got turned down.  I fought the medicaid system and appealed the decision to win and just now got the medical help I was lookin for in May of 2006.  Since waiting so long for this process, My condition has worsened and my portal vein blockage cannot be fixed.  It causes me excruciating chronic pain constantly and now I have to go on the transplant list.  I have a rare disease called portal vein thrombosis where the portal vein to the liver is completed blocked and so is the vein to the spleen.  I have grown my own veins to feed the necessary blood to the liver which is why i am still alive.  I am only 45 and have children and a grandchild that i would like to spend time with, I can no longer work and do not have a spouse.  Had I have gotten the help I needed earlier, i wouldnt be in such dire straights now.  My family has relocated to be with me and try to pay my bills.  I was working with the USACE in LA for six months when I found out I was ill.  Please help me in the appeal of my case for disability.  Because I do not fall into one of their categories like renal failure or kidney disease, they do not consider me disabled.
My vision is going, I have bladder control problems and have to be medicated 24/7.  How could I possibly
hold a job.  The system seems so unfair to people that have worked two jobs their whole lives and raised children, helped in disasters only to find out that their government does not care.  I would appreciate any
thing you could do.

I have documented proof of my clots and illness and the doctors i was sent to for social security did not even look at them when examining me.  They hurt me more with their poking and prodding.  I am in worse shape now.  I am now under the care of a gastroentonologist and he is referring me to Life Line in Tampa who have requested my records.  How is that not a disability.  If I don't die on the table, I certainly would have a long wait for the donor and a long recovery time.

Subject:	Help with fiance petition

Governor Jeb Bush,
     I am writing to ask for your help with my fiance Visa and wedding.  I have contacted the USCIS, US Consulate, Homeland Security, and many lawyers and I believe that you are my last hope.  I am currently petitioning for my fiance to be allowed into the US for marriage.  My case receipt number is WAC0703352272 and is being processed at the California Service Center.   My petition was received by the USCIS on November 17, 2006.  Currently they are working on the petitions they received on June 1, 2006.  Based on the current processing times my case will not even be looked at until at least April 2007.  The problem is that my wedding is planned for February 23, 2007.  
     I am a student attending Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL.  My fiance, Gemma, is an English citizen currently living and working in Stoke-On-Trent, England.  We met in the summer of 2001 while we were both working at the Florida Lions Camp.  It is a camp for children and adults with disabilities.  Gemma come over through a cultural exchange program to work for the summer.  Although she was not paid much for her work she wanted to help those with disabilities.  We began dating that summer.  At the end of the summer Gemma returned home to England.  She came back to visit me at Christmas and I visited her in England in March 2002.  We decided that we wanted to continue our relationship and Gemma returned to work at the Florida Lions Camp on an 18 month work visa.  In August 2002 I moved to Tallahassee to begin college and Gemma stayed at the Florida Lions Camp in Lake Wales.  We traded making the 5 hour drive to see each other every weekend.  When the spring semester was finished I returned to the camp to work for the summer and be with Gemma.  After the summer I returned to school in Tallahassee and Gemma returned to England after her visa expired. 
     We decided that our relationship was strong and that we wanted to marry but were not yet ready financially.  So Gemma applied for another 18 month visa to work at the Florida Lions Camp.  I continued my college and we still saw each other every weekend and in the summer when I returned to work at the camp with her.  When Gemma's visa expired she returned home again and I visited her during breaks from college as we decided what to do next.  I visited Gemma over Christmas in 2004 and asked her to marry me.  We immediately began planning the wedding as we were excited to finally be together.  That summer Gemma returned to work at the camp on a four month visa so that we could plan the wedding. 
     Gemma's visa expired in August 2004 and she returned to England.  We continued to plan the wedding through email, phone and letters.  I also visited Gemma when I had breaks from school such as Christmas and Spring Break.  When summer came around Gemma applied for another visa to work at the Florida Lions Camp.  Since Gemma had previously had 2 18 month visa she had trouble getting a third.  So instead she came to the US as a temporary visitor and volunteered at the camp while I worked there for the summer of 2006.  We planned nearly the entire wedding over the summer including paying deposits.  Gemma returned home in August and that is the last time I saw her. 
     When I returned to school in Tallahassee I submitted the Petition for Alien Fiance.  From our prior experience with visas we believed that the visa process would take between 2 and 4 months.  Filing in October would leave us 4 months before our wedding date.  After filing I discovered that the process takes much longer.  I spoke with the USCIS was informed of the "Accelerated Processing" that is only available in "life or death" or similar situations.  I was told that one considered situation is substantial financial determent to an individual.   My situation creates a financial determent to me, my fiance, and several of my wedding guests.  I have paid for almost all of the wedding.  I have paid for the ceremony location, reception location, photographer, bar service and catering service.   I have also paid for dated invitations, flowers, tuxedos, hotel rooms, and reserved honeymoon accommodations.  In total I stand to lose thousands of dollars if the wedding is rescheduled. 
     Many of my wedding guests have requested time off work and paid for flights, hotels, and car rental as well.   Gemma's family members that are attending the wedding have also requested time off work and paid for flights and accommodations.   If the wedding date is moved many of my guests would not be able to attend the wedding because they will lose the money they have paid and will not be able to afford accommodations and plane tickets at another date.    My sisters from Minnesota will not be able to attend the wedding because they cannot afford to purchase more tickets and also cannot request more time off work for a long time.

            Another complication is that I have accepted a job in Hartford, CT upon graduation in December 2006.   I am supposed to start in April 2007.   We planned on moving to Hartford after the wedding so that Gemma could work in order to help pay for bills and we could have the wedding in Florida with my family and friends.   If the wedding date is moved I would have to request a later start date and jeopardize my job.  Also Gemma has made plans to move out of her current residence and notified her employer that she will be leaving.   She plans to move to the United States and live with me while we complete the wedding plans. 

         I understand that we have underestimated the time it takes to process a Fiance Visa.  I know that the US needs to be careful in their processing.   Gemma has worked in the US several times on different work visas.  She has entered the US to help people with disabilities and also as a temporary visitor.  The US has never had any concerns regarding her entering the US, she has always followed the rules governing her visa and always left promptly when it has expired.   I have made a mistake and am requesting help in fixing that mistake.  We have been planning the wedding for two years and are not simply rushing getting married now.   I stand to lose thousands of dollars if the wedding date is moved.   I make approximately $13,000 a year currently working while attending college, and it has taken me all of the past two years to save the money need to pay for the wedding.  If the wedding date is moved it would take me a long time to save that money up again.   Gemma and I have been waiting for this wedding for more than 2 years and the thought of having to wait even longer is enough to break me.  If there is anything you can do to help I would appreciate it greatly.  If you have any questions please call at any time of day, 863-632-0088.  I would like to speak in person so that I can better explain the situation.   I truly appreciate your consideration and thank you for your understanding and help.

 Governor Bush:

I write to you today concerning a matter that is of grave importance to my 
family, loved ones and to myself.  On June 21, 2005, Senator Leahy (D-VT) 
and Congressman Nadler (D-NY) introduced the Uniting American Families Act 
into the U.S. Congress.  The Uniting American Families Act seeks to amend 
the Immigration and Nationality Act by adding the term "permanent partner" 
where the word spouse appears thus allowing gay and lesbian U.S. citizens 
the opportunity to sponsor their partners for immigration to the U.S.    

U.S. immigration law is based on the principle of family unification.  
Indeed, over 65% of all green card applications are family based 
petitions.  The fact that gay and lesbian U.S. citizens cannot sponsor 
their same-sex partners is grossly unjust and contradicts the policy of 
promoting family unification.  I would like to have the opportunity to 
share with you first hand how current U.S. immigration law affects the 
quality of my relationship of over [X] years with my partner, who is a 
citizen of [name of country].  [insert personal story here]

As one of your constituents, I urge you to become a cosponsor to this bill 
and ask to arrange a constituent visit to discuss this matter with you 
further.  Please contact me at the above information at your earliest 
convenience to arrange an appointment.  Thank you very much for your time 
in this important matter.

Sincerely,

Mr. Bush,
      my name is Nicholas Landry, and I have been a loyal supporter of both bush administrations for years. I have always been very fond of the way you run the government here in Fla., and you had alot of influence in my decision to stay a resident of this wonderful state, however I now have a problem and felt it only fair that i bring it to directly to you. I live in Panama City where I own a flooring business. Recently, in the past few months, we have had a very large increase in illegal immigrants that are taking over the flooring business due to the fact that they are installing floors for much less than any of us honest, tax paying citizens can afford to charge. This has left us out of work.I have been installing floors my entire life and take pride in my workmanship. I now (like many other Floridians in this area), am out of work. This year my children will not have a Christmas because the Spanish people here are installing floors for h alf what we charge, and the businesses are going with the lowest charging installers.these people do not carry workers compensation, only one person per crew has a green card, and only one person per crew can even speak English.I would like to know what your administration plans to do about this issue. It has been proven time and time again that the INS has no plans to deport them due to the cost involved.I very much support many of your ideas and many, many of your decisions in running our great state, however I am very disappointed that my children and many other children will do without this Christmas because these people who do not pay taxes,do not vote, and do not serve in our military, can charge so much less than us honest people.I will understand if you do not reply however I wanted to bring my views to you. thank you for your time in reading my letter. sincerely, Nicholas Landry

Subject:	FEMA Problems

Governor Bush,
 
I am writing you in hopes that you can put an end to this madness I am going through with FEMA.  My name is Anthony Ferreira.  I am married with a son.  I am now living with my family in Orlando, FL.  I am one of the many Hurrican Katrina victims who is having an amazing amount of difficulty receiving the assistance promised me by FEMA.  I guess its probably best that I start from the beginning.
 
I was living in Biloxi, MS during the time Hurricane Katrina hit.  When she passed through she took my apartment and everything I owned.  I stayed with my in-laws in Jackson, TN for about a month after Katrina.  After I received my initial rental assistance I found a place to stay for a reasonable amount based on the amount of monthly assistance FEMA allotted me.
 
The first few months went by with no problems.  I received my second rental assistance and was told that I would be approved for personal property assistance as well.  Thats when things began going downhill.  I was contacted by FEMA and was told that I was ineligable for personal property assistance because the housing inspector told them I had insufficient damage.  I explained to them that wasnt possible because my apartment was condemned.  How can I have insufficient damage when my apartment is so bad that I can barely walk in it?  I mean my ceiling had become my floor.  So I appealled the decision and was told that an inspector would be calling me.  Now while this is going on I am calling every week to keep up on the status of my appeall.  Well on August 8, 2006 I was notified once again that I had unsufficient losses.  And once again neither I nor the management office for the apartment I stayed in heard word one from FEMA.  So to this day I havent received 1 penny for personal property assistance.
 
Now for my problems with rental assistance.  I moved into the house I was renting in Jackson, TN in November 06.  I received a payment of $1776 to assist with my rental payments for the months of Nov, Dec & Jan.  I submitted my paperwork in April for Feb, Mar and April.  I was denied because they said I didnt supply the proper paperwork.  I had to find a way to pay the rent so I left my wife (who started school in December and could not leave) and my 4 year old son and left to stay with a friend in Orlando so I could find a decent job.  
 
In June I became 2 months late with rent and my family was facing eviction because FEMA denied me what was promised to cover 18 months.  I managed to borrow enough money from people to catch up on rent but knew that I know owe friends and that if FEMA denied me again I would be evicted.  
 
So after months of the runaround with FEMA in July I was finally told to supply certain paperwork and I would be given backpay for Feb - Apr plus my assistance for May - July.  I submitted the exact same paperwork I submitted in April plus my new receipts and was approved.  I received $1782 on July 27 to cover May - Jul but did not receive the backpay.  By this time I was extremely tired of calling FEMA and getting nothing so I gave up on the backpay and hoped that when it came time for my next payment that everything would go through fine.  Of course that didn't happen.  When I submitted my paperwork to cover Aug - Oct I was denied yet again.  
 
This time the reasons beat all the others.  All of the paperwork that was good before somehow became invalid.  I spoke to a supervisor over the housing assistance program who gave me multiple reasons why my assistance was denied.  1)  They have no record of where I lived prior to the hurricane  2)  The lease that they have had on file from day 1 has somehow become inelibible because now it looks like I am the one that wrote it 3)  My rent receipts are invalid because 2 of them say I payed in September which is true because I was late because FEMA wouldnt help me and 4)  That my landlords business number which is also his personal cell phone cannot be a real number because the voicemail picks up "Hello" and according to the lady I spoke with NO business has a voicemail like that.  And of course when I tried to dispute these, I was told that if I didnt correct them then I would not receive assistance.
 
So I guess you can say I am losing faith in my governments willingness to help out its own people.  I know this is not a problem exclusive to me and that I may be fighting a losing battle.  I dont know if theres anything you can do or anyone you can put me in touch with to help me but your assistance would be GREATLY appreciated.  I can be contacted at any time of the day at (731)616-3444 or by email at aferreira1979@yahoo.com.  Once again thank you in advance for your assistance and I hope I havent taken up too much of your day.
 
V/R,
Anthony Ferreira

     My name is Anita Fairweather. I've wrote you once before in the past and you fixed the problem. Maybe I can get some help from you on this one as well...
     
     I am trying to get in the Navy for three (3) reasons.
1).My Country
2).Discipline
3).Further Education
 
     Yet the Navy will not accept me due to my seizures. I told recruiter Jason on the phone that I don't have them, and they stay under control as long as I am on my medicine. At that point, he stated they could not accept me due to the fact I am on medication. I feel it is wrong to be judged of what I can and can not achieve just because I take seizure medicine. I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY!!! NOT JUST A PERSON WHO CONTINUES GOING IN AND OUT OF JAIL FROM JUVENILE YEARS ALL INTO THE ADULT YEARS. 
     Please tell me you can help with that goal...TO BE SOMEBODY RATHER THAN TROUBLE...

I know of this individual that came into the U.S. by Mexico. This man is Cuban, but he went to live in Spain when he was12 and became a citizen of Spain. He came into this country requesting political asylum.because he is originally from Cuba and is a Cuban. But he really is a citizen of Spain.He was denied by immigration with no appeal his work permit, yet he went ahead lied  and is currently working. He works for a company named Total Lawn Care in Orange Park, Fl. This company has no knowledge whatsoever that he does not have a work permit in this country, He lied to them and they think he does. He has a bank account in Wachovia where he deposits all his payroll checks along with the money he is getting from HRS Children and Families. He receives cash, food stamps, and medicaid from HRS every month. His name is Arturo Alvarez and resides at 2700 Connie Circle Orange Park, Fl. 32065 (904)579-4156. Please, see that this information is given to proper authorities so that justice is done. I am a U.S. citizen and I sincerely feel that this individual is committing a crime by doing what he is doing. He is breaking the laws of immigration and also using the funds that are available in this country to the citizens of this nation that really need it.

On Wednesday, Rafael Avila and his 16 year old son Jose, were arrested at their home in boca Raton, Florida , taken to jail, and then excorted to Miami Airport for immediate deportation to Columbia, and told not to return for 10 years.  Also arrested were his wife, Wanda Rojas and 20 year old twin daughters, who were later released but only until January 6th, when they must too leave.
 
I have worked with Rafael for seven years now in the same community and this man is someone I look up to as a friend and co-worker, a father, and husband, and a good community man.
 
He has been in South Florida for 11 years, working hard, buying a home, sending his children to school.  the twin girls are "A" students at PBCC.  He has a 5 year old Downs Syndrome son that needs medical and educational attention, and he has always followed the rules paying taxes, and working very hard.
 
He had a bad attorney and didn't udnerstand and the paperwork that was passing  from INS to his attorney and his attorney took his money and never advised him correctly, and now he is a victim of a a horrible US Attorney that has taken the money of an innocent family and separted a father and son from a wife and daughters! Raphael is a tribute to our community!
 
Please, I beg you, if you can help this gentle family get Rapael back to the USA to take care of them and his ill 5 year old son, and help in any way to cancel the scheduled deportation on January 6th of the wife and twin daughters, we will be in your mercy!

Subject:	USA PO Boxes 

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

Why does USA allow those who live in other countries rent our USA Postal PO 
Boxes? Or even hold USA mail addresses? Especially countries (ie Aruba, S. 
America, Mexico) known for their money laundering? Money laundering and tax 
evasions?

It is a very important question I feel our Government should be asked. And I 
feel they should halt allowing them to do so. If they do not live in USA 
they should not be allowed to use our PO Boxes. Makes sense to me.

Not to mention terroist/terrorism exploiting and using our Postal PO Boxes 
and services to help further their communication and cause. I ask you to 
please bring this question forward to the Congress and Senate.

God bless you and yours,

Hi, my name is Usha Patel, I am a legal resident of USA and wanted my parents to visit me from India as they have never visited USA. They tried over a year a go and again on Tuesday. Both times they were refused a visa, not given any reason as to why they are being refused and also the officer did not even look at any paper-work that they had brought with them. They went to England for the first time last year for four weeks and returned to India. They only want to visit for 4-6 weeks and we are willing to satisfy any of your concerns, but to refuse them twice without a reason is not acceptable. 
Please let me know what we can do.
Thank You

Subject:	Help needed - Vittorio Verzillo PhD


Dear Governor Bush,

My name is Vittorio Verzillo, I am an Italian molecular 
biologist-immunologist and I came here in Florida in December 2004, hired 
by Scripps - Florida. 

I love Florida and I planned to settle down here. 

However, today my family and I are facing a very difficult situation and I 
am asking for your help in finding a possibly fast solution to the serious 
problem described below. 

I came in US first as a PhD student in 1998 then as postdoc at Los Alamos, 
New Mexico with a J-1 visa. My visa switched to H1b in 2002 sponsored by 
the University of California. From Jan. 2002 to Dec 2004 I have been Ass. 
Adj. Professor at University of California, San Francisco. From Dec 2004 I 
started to be sponsored by Scripps as Senior Research Associate. 

While in San Francisco, in October 2004 I married my wife Suwarni Leman. 
She is an American citizen.  In Sept. 2005 I sent in the application to 
register permanent residence. 

In May 2006 I have been forced to leave Scripps.

On Sept. 8 2006, my little adorable daughter Jaslyn was born; but I still 
did not receive any news from my permanent residence application (so I 
could not accept a job or position in US). My wife left her job to take 
care of the baby and I really needed to find a job quickly.  I requested an 
appointment to the USCIS; but it was not of any help because they said 
that there is nothing they can do about it. On October 15 I submitted a 
request for an EAD (Employment Authorization Document) that did not arrive 
yet. 

On November 12th , I hired an attorney. Today my impression is that he 
cannot really do very much. 

In the while, my job search resulted in one good possibility (a company 
from New York) that likes my profile, but cannot hire me because I do not 
have yet received my EAD (and they are not allowed to extend/renew my H1b 
visa). 

As scientist I realize also that this possibility can quickly fade away, 
due to the very competitive and fast moving field.  

It is a paradox. I can stay here in US, but I cannot work to feed my 
family and to pay for my mortgage; even if there is a possible employer 
and a position for me! Our savings are almost all gone and we don't know 
how to deal with this. 

I need very much your help and, maybe needless to say, I will greatly 
appreciate you intervention on this (hopefully resulting in a fast 
processing of my EAD). 
On the other hand, I remain available for any professional help or advice 
your office may need from a scientist with my expertise. 

Sincerely,
Vittorio Verzillo

Dear Mr Bush,

I am writing to you, appealing for your help/assistance, in securing 
employment within the Florida Police Department as a Dispathcer.

My name is Andrea Buck 19111963 and am currently serving as a Police 
Officer, within the Greater Manchester Police, England, and have served 11 
years, 6 of which have been as a Communication Officer which is a similar 
role, to that of your Despatchers.

I have a secondary school (high school) education and have college 
certificates in typing, shorthand and office studies.

My husband Andrew Buck 09111966, is also a Police Officer and has served 12 
years, 5 of which within the Communications Branch, and he would dearly love 
to be a Police Officer.  However, we understand that to be a Police Officer 
he would have to be an American Citizen, is that correct?, and are there any 
avenues, we can go down to maybe secure visas etc.

We would dearly love to live and work in the United States and would 
appreciate any advice which you may be able to give us in achieving this, 
which is our dream.

We love the United States and everything it stands for, but understand that 
with the Conflict ongoing in Iraq and the occurrence of the tragedy of 9/11 
has somewhat closed the doors to Visa applications.  But with the close 
alliance, the United Kingdom has with the United States, we would hope that 
maybe something could be done for us, and we hope that you can maybe point 
us in the right direction and hopefully consider us for positions within the 
Florida Police Department.

Thanking you in anticipation, and looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Our home address is 12 Churchbank, Stalybridge, Cheshire, England (zip code 
SK15 2QJ)

Andrea and Andy Buck

I and other Americans/Floridians I work with and in my neighborhood are getting very worried & concerned about all the immigrants.  We all agree we like to help people but what about ‘our own’?

I just learned that California must build 1 new school each day to keep up with their growth due to people coming in from other countries – mainly Mexico.  This is really not good for America.  What can Floridians do to help the situation?  Please advise on what I can pass on to neighbors, co-workers & business owners in the area who are worried & concerned about the immigration situation.

Thank you for any help & advice you can give.

Subject:	sir i need your help

Gov Bush i know you will wonder why i am appealing to you for help being i am in NC.  I am getting no help here and i am appealing to you to forward a message to the President.  I have sent several emails to the White House and many other agents and not getting the help i need.  I am a republican and not getting any help from my republican people.  The problem is that nothing gets to the senators nor the congressman.  They are halted at the local offices and get no futher.  Let me say before i explain my problem is i am a retired minister also.  I spent 28 years in the Christian Ministry and never lied about anything to get what i wanted and i am not starting now.
My wife is from Australia.  We had known each other for almost 4 years.  She wanted me to come to Australia but we knew i could not become a citizen there because of my health problems.  So she decided to come and visit me.  After she had been here about 2 weeks i knew how much i loved her and she felt the same way.  I did not want her to go back and she did not want to.  I am on disability and did not have the money for all that.  We also knew it could take her another year to get back here with all she had to do.  At that time i called Senator Elizabeth Dole's office and asked if there was any way she could stay here and be legal.  They called me back and said if we got married in 90 days she could stay and be here legal.  We were also told she would be on a 2 year probation before she could get a green card and a ss card.  That was fine with us at least we would be together.  Her 2 years is up now and i called INS and asked for the papers to fill out for her green card.  In the meantime while we were waiting for the paper work her daughter called and asked her if there was any way she could come back to Au and be a part of her wedding.  Every mother wants to be with her daughter during this important time of her life.  I told my wife i had to do some calling and find out.  I called the INS and told them all she had was her Au passport and a copy of our wedding cerificate and wanted to know was there any way she could go and get back here ok.  I also explained that she did not have her green card but we were waiting for the papers to file for it.  The agents response was even if you had the papers in hand right now you could not get them done and approved before she wanted to go, but she will be ok.  I asked again and said are you sure and he said yes.  So iput my wife on a plane after the tickets got here that her daughter paid for and sent her to Australia.  When she got ready to come home she presented her passport and her marriage cerificate and the airport in Brisbane.  The lady at the airport said they had no problems sending her home but she needed to call LA Homeland Security to make sure she would be ok.  The agent there refused to let her board the plane.  The Au lady asked why, she has her marriage cerificate showing she is married to an American Citizen and been married for 2 years.  They still refused.  The authorities at Brisbane callled me and told me what was going on and asked if i would call LA and explained to them what the INS told me.  I said yes i would.  She gave me the number and i called.  I told the agent who i was and gave him my wives name and tried to explain to him what the INS told me.  I could not get 4 words out before he would interupt me and say, "Your eife not come home here, your wife not board the plane."  Yes i ahd a foreign person in charge of the HLS.  Everytime i tried again to explain, i got the same answer.  He was very rude and nasty to me.
I spent frm sunday night till wednesday night sending emails and making phone calls on the state level and to Washington to try and get this solved.  No one would do anything because i did not get the agents name.  When i got the State Dept they said it was HLS issue.  HLS would say it is a State Dept issue, and on and on one group puts it on another group.  When i called Senator Dole's office they changed everything they had told me before.  There was a new lady there and was not the one there when my wife first got here.  I know it was another cover up to protect the lie and the misleading given to me by INS.  Senator Burr's office is the only that has given me any help at all.  They told me to do a I-130 form and she could get home.  But it will take 6-8 months to get her back.  Now i know that Senator Dole did not see any of my emails or i might have gotten more help.  
Sir my wife and i should not have to wait 6-8 months to be back together because of a mistake made by INS.  I am 66 years old and not in good health.  I am a bad diabetic and recently had a heart attack.  I have been back in the hospital 4 times with heart problems since i had the heart attack.  
All i am asking is for someone to admit a mistake was made and get my wife back home.
I hope you will let Governor Bush see this email and maybe he can get it to the President or the Vice President and get me some help.  There is no need to send it to INS because i ahve talked to them many times.  I talked to a Dr. White in DC and she said she was going to pull all the tapes around that day to the number i called and have them listened too.  Sir do you think that is going to happen?  I don't.  Even if they do they will never admit it.
Sir i just want my wife back.  I need her.  I miss her and i love her.  Right now she is very upset and so am I.  I cannot believe my govt has turned their back on an American citizen and will give no help.
I told someone the other day i taught govt and us history in high school working my way through college and seminary.  Right now if i was teaching govt i could not use the text book about my govt and my govt officials.  I would ahve to write my own text book.
Please, i beg you, whoever gets this email, please let Gov Bush read it.  Please help me get my wife back.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,




Hello. My name is James Olmstead. I am a Florida High School Student. I am 
currently taking a course in American Government and I am curious as to 
whether or not I may ask you a question concerning a present day issue.

The issue is as following: Immigration. What is your opinion on the matter 
of immigration? Are you for or against reforming immigration policy? Do you 
believe that immigrants are the foundation of the United States, or that 
they are a matter to be dealt with forcefully? Do you believe in supporting 
those immigrants who have already made it into the United States, or do you 
believe that they should be deported? What is your opinion on the matter of 
the increased boarder control?

These are the issues that I am investigating. I thank you for taking the 
time to read through my e-mail. I hope that you will have a chance to e-mail 
me in return with your answers to the above questions.

My mother is the oldest of sixteen and left school in the 10th grade.  I am very proud of her as she was proud to be working for you.  To say my mother absolutely adores you (and Sheriff Charlie Wells) would be putting it mildly.  My mother’s husband has been affected by this Medicare premium reimbursement issue for this entire year, as I have.  I was told your office couldn’t help because it was a federal issue.  When told that I replied how much closer to the federal government could you get than your brother being President.  This was after a day of calls getting nowhere.  
 
Governor Bush I also want to tell you a story.  I worked for Upstate Medicare Part B for 20 years.  My first job was as a beneficiary telephone clerk.  At that time, I was new and only “trained” to answer calls according to the manual.  It was Christmas Eve around 11 am.  It was announced that we were being let out early for Christmas.  As my  
co-workers were singing, laughing, and signing off the phones I was still on a call with a beneficiary.  The call was with a very frail sounding elderly woman.  She wanted to know if her Medicare check (for doctor’s services) had been mailed because in a prior call she had been told it was processed, but still hadn't received it.  She hoped it would arrive in that days mail before the electric company closed because her electric had been shut off.  She hoped to pay it before the electric company closed.   She lived in Buffalo, it was cold and she was using a candle at night.  She was alone and had no living family.   When I looked in my system, I saw the claim was still in process for 120 days.  I went to my supervisor and was told tell her it was still in process and end the call.  When I asked her if there was anything she could do she said get her off the phone.  She wanted to sign the phones off and close the office.   I explained to the caller her claim was still in process.  She began to cry in this very faint voice.  I told her I would write it up for my supervisor who would she what she would do when we returned.   
 
Governor Bush tears ran down my face as I hung up, as everyone was frolicking around the office.  I have never forgotten that day.  I was sick to my stomach for many reasons, the lack of care, concern and desire to help someone in such need.   
       
The call is always with me, I think it has helped make me who I am.  It especially bothers me every Christmas.  I tell you this story because it has had such an affect on my life in how I see and help others.   I was only 18 years old at the time and only trained in handling telephone calls.  As years passed, I was promoted to many positions ending as Director of Claims and Correspondence Operations.  I could have done so much had I had the knowledge at that time of the Christmas Eve call.  As well with maturity, I would have made calls to the electric company etc.  I have gone to many extremes to help beneficiaries through those 20 years and to date because of that call.  As I stated to Senator Martinez $1066.20 may not seem like much to some, but it can be the world of difference to others.  
 
Governor Bush over this past year in many calls I made knew I was being blown off.  I know you will be leaving in a few weeks but regardless of a title, as a human being do whatever you can to get this issue resolved.    Please.
 
Thank you for your time.

To Whom It May Concern:

 

I was recently made aware that Medicare will only provide powered wheelchairs which suit the person’s needs inside his/her home.  I am a double amputee quadriplegic and use a powered wheelchair.  To say that this mandate appalls me is an understatement.  Most powered wheelchairs that are only suited for indoor use are next to useless outside of the home.  Since going outside at some times is a necessary activity, doing so in an underpowered chair only suited for indoor use would be dangerous, it might end up costing Medicare far more money due to accidents caused by unsafe use of such wheelchairs.  Not to mention possible lawsuits that would eventually be filed.  Then there are the thousands of jobs that could be lost because wheelchair manufacturers and distributors would be put out of business, resulting in lost tax revenue and higher unemployment expenses.

 

Does Medicare really want disabled people to stay inside all of the time?  Isn’t that discrimination against people with disabilities and, therefore, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?  Are we not allowed to venture outside for doctor appointments (something required to remain living in many cases), grocery shopping (another activity necessary to live), or just to enjoy going outside for a social activity (a vital activity for our mental health)?  Are we to be condemned to a life inside our homes as if we were hermits?

 

Back in the 1980’s, I was on several committees at my college that help write the ADA and was proud to have been asked to participate in drafting that landmark legislation.  I had no idea that in the future the federal government would be the entity that violated that act.  It is unconscionable that a government agency that provides healthcare availability to the disabled would attempt to so blatantly violate an act of Congress.

 

I’m requesting that this extreme restriction on the type of powered wheelchairs we can obtain through Medicare be changed.  Being disabled and on Medicare should not mean we are relegated to being “out of sight, out of mind” as it seems this agency (Medicare) desires.  I am only 56 years old and am not going to stay indoors the remainder of my life.  This “wheelchair edict,” as I call it, is far too limiting and needs to be changed.  That change needs to be made as soon as humanly possible.

 

This is of utmost importance as it affects both the physical and mental health of all persons needing powered wheelchairs.  Please allow our doctors, Physical Therapists, Occupational Therapists and wheelchair seating specialists determine which wheelchairs best suit our needs as far as comfort, power, safety and health are concerned.  Don’t leave our ability to be mobile, safe and comfortable in the hands of a Medicare or Medicaid bureaucrat.  People with disabilities struggle with many things.  Don’t make them struggle to just move around.

Estimado Sr. Bush
 
Hace unos dias le escribi en relacion a una medico cubana que ha ingresado a este pais pidiendo el amparo de la Ley de Ajuste Cubano, y asilo politico, lleva dos semanas castigada bajo la juridiccion de Texas por haber entrado ilegal a este pais, creo que en Texas no saben que Cuba es un pais comunista y llegamos a esta gran nacion pidiendo asilo politico.
Yo he llamado hoy al US Marshall de Texas y me han informado que despues del castigo que le ha impuesto el Juez a mi hermana, ella sera deportada a su pais natal.( Cuba).........pienso que esto es un
gran error y por eso me vuelvo a dirigir a ustedes, como ciudadana cubano americana que soy, por llevar tantos años en este gran pais, y por ser libre, deseo que mi hermana tambien lo sea.
Le adjunto de nuevo los datos sobre ella y si hay alguna orientacion que me puedan dar, alguna ayuda
Dios los bendecira eternamente.
Muchas gracias por su atencion a este caso.

Datos Generales.
Silvia de los Angeles Rodriguez Martinez .
Fecha de Nacimiento : Noviembre /11/1958.
Ciudadania : Cubana.
Numero de tarjeta de preso :INS 55750M
Numero de recibo: 480079E-B
. 
El dia /11/23/2006 a las 5.30   PM  fue detenida en la frontera Mexico –EUA en el punto de Piedras Negras  por entrada  ilegal a los EUA( en conversacion telefonica con la familia , refiere que cruzo el rio , paso la cerca y llamo al official de Inmigracion informandole que se entregaba que era Cubana , Medico , y que solicitaba Asilo Politico para acogerse a la Ley de Ajuste  Cubano ) 
Fue  conducida hasta un departamento donde fue interrogada , le llenaron algunos documentos  informandole que le tenian dos noticias , una Buena y una mala, : que seria castigada de 1 a 15 dias por entrada ilegal al pais y despues iria a la corte para que decidieran que hacer con ella. y la trasladaron hacia un centro de detencion donde solo habian mujeres y ella como unica Cubana,. 
El Viernes siguiente 24/noviembre /2006 a las 5.00 pm recibimos una llamada identificandose como de la oficina de inmigracion informando que Silvia Rodriguez estaba detenida en Valverde del Rio S an Antonio Texas  (HEO INC VALVERDE Centro de detencion penal)acusada de entrada illegal al pais, que anotaramos un numero de telefono para que el viernes proximo llamaramos a la oficina del Marshall ( telef 1-830-703-20750 para que nos informaran para que prision la iban a llevar y buscaramos un abogado de Inmigracion para ponernos de acuerdo como iban a ser los tramites de visita correspondencia , comunicacion , etc, en la noche nos comunicamos via telefonica con ella preocupados por su estado de salud . le recogieron todas sus pertenencias entregandole una bolsa con el uniforme que  debia ponerse , fueron dias feriados y no encontramos ninguna formas de documentarnos sobre esa situacion tan atipica que estaba ocurriendo pues lo que es conocido, asi no ocurre con los cubanos que desean entrar al pais. Seguimos comunicandonos con la Dra Silvia y precisando sobre todo su estado de salud pues salio huyendo de Honduras con una Epicondilitis de la rodilla y ella tiene asma bronquiel ligera, ella desesperada pidiendo un abogado pues seguia recogiendo informacion que alli no habian estado cubanos y en el centro de detencion no tenia ninguna informacion, el lunes comenzamos a hacer gestiones y para nuestro asombro no nos convencio la conducta de los abogados consultados (al parecer no habian interpretado bien la situacion en que se encontraba) algunos hablaban de fianza otros de esperar , el miercoles 29/niviembre nos entrevistamos con un funcionario de  la Congresista Ileana Ross orientandonos que eso llevaba un proceso que dentro de varias semanas recibiriamos respuesta y que en algun tiempo ella saldria, .nos preguntaron por que no habia ido al consulado Americano en Honduras , por referencias cortas de la
Dra conocimos que aunque ya existia a partir de la ley aprobada para el personal de la salud cumpliendo mision que quisiera deserter y entrar a los EUA La persecucion y el ostigamiento se acrecento cada dia mas al extremo  que resultaba humanamente insoportable  , habia que reportarse cada 4 horas  aun de madrugada , desechando la posibilidad de refugiarse en el consulado Americano..
EN la madrugada del viernes fue interrogada por un abogado de defensa publica  Dr Andres Gonzalez quien presento su caso ante el Jues( Siendo procesada el dia 01/dicienbre por el delito de entrada illegal al pais) por lo que tendria que cumplir un castigo , para despues ser procesada. ( esta informacion es por Silvia , pues no se ha podido contactar con el abogado ,ella nos dijo que llamaramos a Public Defensa de Texas ( telef 8307032041) Para ver como localizarlo., Ese mismo dia fue trasladada al Correccional de Crystal City. (CCCC 6901 NHWY 83 Crystal City, TX) telef 8303743447.Manteniendose como unica cubana que ha pasado por ese lugar y  caso, . Nos informo por llamada telefonica que llamaramos a la oficina del Marshall del Rio para que nos informaran cuales eran los paso a seguir  y reclamar sus pertenencias,  pero ellos atienden  solamente para dar informacion de 10.00am a 11.00am..

Dear governor, 

        My name is Rosa E Zelaya I'm 26 years old and live in Freeport Florida. I have two lovely children, one is 6 1/2 and the otherone is1 year old. I move to this country in 1991. I graduated from Freeport High School in1999. At first it was difficult because I didn't spoke the language, but I knew it wasn't impossible to learn it.Now I try to help other people who come to this country and who do not speak the language. Today I'm as king for your help. My father moved to this country since 1986 a year later my mother came to this country, and then my sister and I came in 1991. For many years we have try to get our citizenship but till this point we are unable to get it. We being denied three times already, and now we have a deportation order that we are trying to stop. We have a court date set for June 2007. My family is an honest, and hard working people. They like to do everything the right way. In 1986 when the amnesty when on my father refused to cheat by buying fake job letters, he wanted to do it the right way. Since then we have try so hard to get our citizenship. My father hasn't been back to his country for 33 years, he haven't seen his family for that period of time, he has 2 daughters in El Salvador of his first marriage, out of the two of them we have met one of them. There still another daughter that he doesn't know and four grand daughters that one day he hopes to meet . My mother on the other side has not seen my grandfather for 19 years and my sister and I haven't seen him for 15 years now. We haven't been back since we left Mexico because we really want to get our citizenship. We are not any trouble makers, we are harmless to the country,we are not here to cause any damages, we are here because we deserved a good live were there is no hunger and poverty. We also want the best for our children. Please help us stop that deportation order and help us make our dream come true. 

Thank you for your time and comprehension. 
I'm looking forward to hear from you soon!! 

Sincerely

To Mr Bush
I would really like you to help us in a situation that i feel only you can help us with,  we are having problem's with the immigration officer's,  we are from England and have lived here and been paying taxes for almost 7 year's and have 2 son's both of which are married to American citizen's one of them has been refused a green card because he was the driver of a car and the passenger bought $10 worth of drug's,  he himself did not even know where to get drug's from but another passenger with him told him where to go for them,  and he really need's to get his green card or citizenship so he can work and support his wife and of course pay his taxes to help support the country which he enjoy's living and be able to live a normal life with him wife,  if he get a pardon from you this will put him on the track so he can be settled and happy,  the other son his going through the process at the moment but the I N S are asking for thing's that they have keeped in 2002 and if he don't produce these item's he will be denied and they already have them,  people can't get to talk to an officer and when you do all they will say to you is read the letter and follow the instruction on the letter no one will listen to reason and then we all suffer because of there mistake's,  again he for the same reason's as is brother need's to get that citizenship so he can take care of his wife in a normal every day life,  as for myself and my husband we was E2 Visa holder's and have been denied because the I N S say that we do not earn enough money in the business,  my husband earn's between $14000.000 to $16000.000 per month, and i had a position at Seaworld Orlando working in guest service's and have not been able to work there since June when my Visa and work permit ran out, again we need to get our citizenship so that we never get these problem's again and also be able to travel back to England if and when our family member's get sick, there in there later year's and this concern's me a great deal,  we have attorney working on it for us but don't seem to be doing any good,  
This is just a small part of our suffering, we are going deeper and deeper into depression because of all that is going on and cannot settle or live a normal life here and all we want to do each day is get up go to work come home cook a meal enjoy the park's enjoy the Florida sunset's and go to bed at the end of the day to do it all again the next day.
We don't expect nothing from the state of Florida we all own our home's and would all like to pay our taxes just like the next person,  and if we were citizen's we will be able to vote.
Please if you can help us i would be so grateful, you really are our last hope in this situation,   if you would like to set up a meeting so we can go over this matter further that would be wonderful,  you can reach me by replying to this e,mail or my cell (863-605-3935) or my husband's cell (863-605-3934) or fax (863-424-7865).

MY FINGERPRINTS HAVE CLEARED BUT THE NAME CHECK FROM THE F.B.I. HASEN'T CLEARED YET, IT IS STILL PENDING, THEREFORE I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THAT CLEARS IN ORDER FOR ME TO BECOME A U.S CITIZEN.

I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL OFFICERS FROM USCIS,BECAUSE THE FORM WAS FILED INITIALLY THROUGH THEM BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AT THIS POINT, AND THEY KEEP TELLING ME TO CONTACT THE F.B.I (NAME CHECK DEPARTMENT) OBVIOUSLY, AFTER TRYING SEVERAL TIMES TO CONTACT THEM (F.B.I NAME CHECK) I FINALLY GAVE UP BECAUSE SPECIFICALLY THAT DEPARTMENT HAS A RECORDING THAT SAYS THEY DONT ACCEPT ANY PHONE CALLS ANYMORE  AND THEY DON'T RESPOND TO NEITHER LETTERS BY MAIL NOR E-MAILS.
I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY A NAME CHECK TAKES THIS LONG TO CLEAR,...
AT THIS POINT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS, MAYBE IF YOU COULD DIRECT ME TO THE RIGHT DEPARTMENT, OR AT LEAST SPEAK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS MATTER?

Dear Governor Bush:
 
My name is LTC Dennis K. Bennett, [REDACTED], 6602 North Lagoon Drive, Panama City, FL 32408.  I was proudly activated in January 2004 to serve my country in Operation Enduring Freedom.  I arrived to Kuwait in February 2004, was injured 6 weeks later, shipped to Germany for 30 days and then assigned to the MEDHOLD at Ft Stewart. In August of 2004 I was transferred to CBHCO Florida. I have been in the program ever since.  Over a year ago I requested to be released from the medical program so that I may be able to return to work. But DR Carr of FL CBHCO denied my request. A PED (Physical Evaluation Board) was finally started in August 2006 and I spent a month a FT Gordon while that was being processed.  When the board in San Antonio made their decision, I was found on 10% disabled but medically unfit. I challenged this and appeared before the board at a formal hearing and they upheld their decision.  I sent documents back to the board that proved I could pass my AFPT test, fire my weapon, and carry a fifty pound back pack for 2.5 miles.  I have completed every task that has been asked of me to demonstrate that my years of experience should not be put to waste. The board sent these findings back to FT Gordon where DR Purvis refused to accept them. Sir, I am requesting your assistance so that I may continue my military career and continue to serve my country.  I am an Army LTC in the Corp of Engineers and can carry all assigned duties.  It is my understanding that there are a shortage of Engineer Officers to carry out all the construction projects that the Corp has been tasked to over see.  I desperately desire to continue to do my part and serve my country. Sir I yet to ask, but if you can offer any assitance and pass this on up to tour the higher command, I would be forever in you debt. 
 
Thank You,
LTC Dennis K. Bennett

my lump sum benefit would be and that they had already paid my
attorney. Now they are saying that due to a mistake in processing 
my paperwork they have no idea when I will receive my benefits.
I have over $ 18,000.00 in medical bills that are currently being

Sorry I sent this to the wrong site. Hope your days are much better then mine. God Bless you and may you keep on touching the hearts of all you come in contact with. In 1989 I was nominated to the Broward County Training Association as well as the Broward County Hospital Board. You sent me a congratulatory card each time. I was touched. I have been your supporter ever since. I supported your brother for President because of my support for you and admiration for your genuine concern to make a difference. Unfortunately I never had the gumption to say any thing personal to you when we have met in the crowds that come to meet and greet you. Lalita

Dear Governor Bush,
You are the last person I would bother but now you are the only one who can help me and Americas Health Choice Medical Plans, a Medicare HMO serving 6 counties with the bulk of our members in St. Lucie, Martin, Indian River and Okeechobee Counties since 2000. CMS is terminating our contract. Walter , I and 500 employees need your help.
 
 During 2000 to 2004 when reimbursements were low all other HMOs left the area. CMS welcomed us and we grew fast. Unfortunately since no one from our Company had ever worked in an HMO . Getting experienced people to move to the Treasure Coast where there was no HMO was not easy. We were busy opening Primary Care Centers to take care of members and our Centers were the 1st Centers that gave the member hr right to come to the office any time, 7 days a week, with no Co pays for the Primary Care or Specialist visit. Our benefits were the best in any County. 
 
In  Nov. 2002 we expanded to Palm Beach and no HMO gave the benefits we gave. In Nov. 2003 we expanded to Broward county and our benefits were richer then Humana , Care plus or Well Care. We beat the competition hands down. In Sept. of 2004 we were hit 3 times by all the hurricanes that hit the Treasure Coast. Our Corporate Office and staff were affected 3 times. We were visited by CMS in January and we had not fixed the deficiencies they wanted fixed. They did not even consider that our medical centers and main office were all affected. We had construction, staffing, relocation and all the various problems that only a large recurring hurricane could damage. When I mentioned it to our Plan manager at CMS and asked her for a stay or an extension she said all HMOs had been affected . Who were we to challenge her.? So they came . Neither the staff not the problems could get fixed when peoples homes were destroyed, they had mold in their homes and needed time to take care of themselves.
 
We made many changes to be in compliance and when we saw that CMS was not being responsive to any thing that we did we decided to sell the Company and get out of the HMO industry and keep the medical centers that gave the care to the members. The sale did not go through. At the 11th  hour the public Company that was to buy us and had been managing us for 8 months with drew their offer. They changed their minds and wanted to pick us up for nothing as CMS kept telling us to close the deal or they would put sanctions. HealthSpring did not want to pay us even a 1/3 of the original selling price and expected us to acquiesce . We did not. They are still managing us and making $800,000 per month doing this with 2 employees from Nashville who commute to Vero Beach.
 
In conclusion:

*	 13,000 seniors , will be asked to disenroll from America's Health Choice.  
*	Some of these areas have only 1 HMO. 
*	Members will not have the choice of seeing the doctors they saw for 5 years. In 4 counties AHCMP has between 85% to 97 % of Medicare HMO membership. 
*	 Just before Christmas about 150 employees of America's Health Choice will be let go. 
*	 An additional 100 employees will be released from the Medical Centers when membership changes. 
*	 America's Health Choice did do all that was required in the Corrective Action Plan and yet CMS refuses to accept them since 2005. 
*	America's Health Choice Medical Plans and its employees request you to intervene on their behalf to stop the termination from occurring. 
*	AHCMP has presented a Temporary Restraining Order and an injunction on Saturday to have the Courts review the merits of the termination decision. 
*	We were there for the community for 5 years when there were no HMO in these rural and semi rural areas. Now that reimbursements are high and CMS has choices they have chosen to  abuse their power and make us, a small Company an example . CMS has kept us under unfair scrutiny since 2005. of Currently all the compliance issues have been rectified. We are not only well with in the days to pay electronic claims and process appeals and grievances but we are above the industry average. 
*	When sanctions were placed and enrollments in the plan stopped we were 16,000 members and a year and a half later we have managed to keep 13,000 members. Can it be in spite of the normal rate of attrition after the hurricanes and the normal death and relocation of residences and no new members added to the plan we would have had all those members if the medical care and service was not good.?  
*	
	In the end we have given good care .Our primary care Centers are open 24 / 7 to members. No consideration was given for the devastation of the 3 hurricanes that hit our home base and the residences of our employees. In fact for 2 years we had the only physicians offices to open and offer free services to all in the community
*	
	You are our last hope to saving the HMO, its members and employees prior to  Christmas. 

            When  discussing this with friends like Carol Jean and Joe Finnegan they were surprised that Walter and I  had not asked for your help prior to this. We thought that our attorneys would be adequate. We were wrong. We hope we are not to late in requesting your assistance.

Subject:	Re: Disability

Dear Mr. Bush:
I am corresponding with you because I am extremely frustrated and baffled.  To make a long story short, I fell two years ago, lost my job, and have been deemed medically disabled by all three of my doctors.  I applied for disability May 2006, and was denied, even though I have two years of medicals and various tests proving that I am in extreme pain and disabled.  
 
I then, in desperation contacted and hired Binder and Binder to help me with my claim.  It has been since May 2006, when I first filed on my own, and then in October 2006 when I, with my attorneys, appealed.  It is now December 2006 and no word yet from the state.  
It is pathetic to me that first, I have to hire an attorney to help me, I have been unable to work since October 2004, and have lost everything.  I have worked since I was 16 and am now disabled at 36 years of age.  I just found out that a very wealth friend of mine has been deemed disabled by the State of Florida, after a replacement knee surgery and ONLY three months of waiting to get his approval from the state.   Yet, I am STILL waiting for benefits, and have once been denied.  How is it that an individual that is not nearly as disabled as my self, already has his benefits only waiting three months to get them, and was NEVER denied.  
 
What will you do for me, a citizen of the United States, that has worked hard all my life and will be out on the street, if I do not get my disability benefits from the state.
 
Sincerely,
Luanne Ricciardi

CECIL FIELD COMMERCE CENTER SELECTED AS SITE FOR MAJOR AVIATION PRODUCTION
SITE

On Monday, I applauded the C-27J industry team of L-3 Communications
Integrated Systems, Finmeccanica's Alenia North America, Global Military
Aircraft Systems and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems for their commitment
to establish the group's advanced aircraft operation at Jacksonville's Cecil
Commerce Center if awarded a Department of Defense contract. I toured the
C-27J aircraft and potential assembly and production site along with
Congressman Ander Crenshaw, Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton, and state and
local business leaders. In selecting Jacksonville's Cecil Field, the C-27J
Joint Cargo Aircraft team has embraced the strengths of our state's
pro-business climate, robust defense industry and highly skilled aviation
and aerospace workforce. This new assembly and production activity will
enhance Florida' economy and would be a great addition to the state's
thriving aviation sector, currently the third strongest in the nation. Most
importantly, the C-27J will help our men and women of the Army and the Air
Force continue to serve and defend our country. The Department of Defense
is expected to award the Joint Cargo Aircraft contract in early 2007. Should
the Department award the multi-billion dollar contract to the C-27J team,
the group will begin establishing its advanced aircraft operation at the
Jacksonville site in 2007. The facility is expected to employ more than 200
people. For more information on our economic development initiatives,

2006 FLORIDA YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE SURVEY RESULTS ANNOUNCED

On Tuesday, I announced the results of the 2006 Florida Youth Substance
Abuse Survey. In the last eight years, we have worked to strengthen
substance abuse prevention, and we have seen significant progress in the
cause. This year's results confirm that progress is being made, but the
work is not done. Since 2000, Florida has seen declines in the use of
heroin, ecstasy and LSD, as well as in the use of cigarettes and alcohol.
This year, 12 of the 21 categories measured current use below two percent.
Conducted among 6th through 12th graders throughout the state for the
seventh consecutive year, the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey is the
most extensive survey of its kind in the nation. The survey assesses
lifetime drug usage and current usage. I was joined for Tuesday's
announcement by First Lady Columba Bush, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings,
Director of the Florida Office of Drug Control Bill Janes, state agency
heads, law enforcement officials and substance abuse prevention specialists
- key partners in reducing substance abuse throughout the state. For view

Attachments:	job hiring complaint.doc

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am enclosing a letter that I emailed to the investigative team of my local South Florida ABC news agency.  This letter details the questionable hiring practices that federal agencies are using when hiring VEOA veterans.  It also touches on the emotional and financial hardship that it has created for applicants, such as myself, who are affected by these hiring practices.  
 
It is my hope that you will use your level of authority to affect positive change within the federal employment system so that no other veteran has to be demoralized in their quest for employment with a government that they so proudly served in uniform. 
 
Having served eight years of Naval service in an active duty capacity, I have completed an additional fourteen years of service as a Naval Reservist.  This has included eighteen months of active duty support, since 2001, under Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom.  I ask that you put yourself in my shoes when you read the enclosed letter and consider how you'd feel in my situation.  Let that be what guides your conscience in the handling of this matter.
 
Thank you for your attention to my request.  I hope to hear from you in the near future.
 
 
Very sincerely,

To, 
Mr. 'Jeb' Bush,
 
Hello,
 
My name is Javiriyah Ashraf and as a student in American Government, I have been assigned to ask opinions of the elected officials for my county, state, or country. It is very important for a resident to know what his or her elected officials do; yet more important is what the elected official thinks. The thinking process determines the outcome of society based on the designated official.
 
Every student is required to choose an issue in the United States today and research on it. My chosen issue is immigration and my question to you is, what is your opinion or viewpoint towards the idea of legal and illegal immigrants living in the United States, and those coming abroad. 
 
I would like to thank you for your time and effort put in this letter. Please reply, if it isn’t too much trouble.

Apt. 902
Jacksonville, FL. 32257

It is by law that we are forced, if we work to pay FICE, or Social Security. Now letâ€™s break down the word FICA. FICA stands for, â€œOld age survivors & Disability insuranceâ€. Now letâ€™s focus on just the latter of these words, Disability Insurance. 
The word Disability, according to Websterâ€™s means; That which disables or disqualifies, a disabled condition. 
Now the word Insurance, according to Websterâ€™s. A contract purchased to guarantee compensation for a specified loss by fire, death, etc. An insuring of or being insured.
Together these words mean just what they say, Disability Insurance. That means that if I were to suffer a, oh I donâ€™t know, letâ€™s say a stroke, the leading cause of disability in America, I could count my blessings because I have â€œDisability insuranceâ€. My worries about how I was going to pay my bills while I was recovering were put to rest because I have â€œDisability insuranceâ€, that stuff I have been paying the Government for well over thirty years. 

Well it just so happened that on the early morning of November 14th, 2005 I did suffer a stroke. It was the single most devastating thing that I have ever been through.  
I use the word suffer because thatâ€™s what I have done since my stroke. I have suffered from seizures, severe headaches, night sweats, insomnia, panic attacks, a torn rotator cuff because my muscles in my shoulder forgot they were suppose to hold my joint in place, anti-social behavior, I have a distinct limp on my right side, I can barely write my name and thatâ€™s not to mention the hardships and mental distress this has put on my wife.  
My neurologist, who is board certified and well respected in Jacksonville wont let me drive a car or work, I take two different types of seizure medication along with pain pills for the headaches. I need surgery on my shoulder but have to wait until they get my seizures under control. All the while my car is being repossessed, my credit is crap and my poor wife just barely pays the rent, electric, cable and buys food. Meanwhile the Government, my Government that I have paid into for over thirty years tells me I cant have any Social Security Disability benefits and to get a job. 

Now I donâ€™t have degrees from some big university or a doctrine from some other place but I am smart enough to know right from wrong, and this is just plan wrong no matter how you look at it.

Social Security has denied me twice; so far this has taken a year. I have never been seen by any of their doctors or so called specialist. Now Social Security says that a person must be; Disability under Social Security is based on your inability to work. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if you cannot do work that you did before and we decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition(s). Your disability must also last or be expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. Well my disability has lasted for a year so far; I cannot do the work I did before my Neurologist says I canâ€™t work. Some days I cant even get up for the seizures and headaches. 

Now Social Security has washed their hands of the nasty business of approving or denying someone for disability, even though itâ€™s their baby. They have given that nasty little job to the â€œFlorida Department of Healthâ€. My first case was with a very rude lady by the name of Debra Rinella. My second case was with a very pleasant lady named Karley Vaughan. Now both of these ladies said they were going to schedule me to meet with their doctors, they never did. Although Iâ€™m not sure what type of medical training or credentials these ladies have that allow them to make medical decisions or how they were able to determine that I was not disabled from talking to me over the phone, heck my neurologist has seen me numerous times in person and still cant pinpoint my condition although he is sure it is the result of my stroke. 
Now letâ€™s just say for a minute that someone would hire and put up with my anti-social behavior, my missing work because I had a seizure that morning or my being have looped because of my medication, how would I get there? My doctor says I cant drive, we cant afford public transportation and what if I had a seizure while on the bus?

Now I am not the brightest person in the world but it seems to me that Social Security is broken and needs help now. Think of all of the people who nonchalantly get denied on a daily basis by a bunch of overworked and overburdened state or federal employees, who think the next guy can worry about this case when these are real and needy people who depend on these individuals to do the right thing, but who are overburdened with too many cases.   
And they wonder why the suicide rate is so high amongst seizure victims, we are sick! We donâ€™t want to be a burden on our families and loved ones. We just want what we are do. No more or no less. We paid into this monster, now itâ€™s time we get something back, it shouldnâ€™t be this hard. Do the right thing.

Back in Sept I separated from the Navy due to family reason dealing with my 2 foster children. On November 07 I received information from my old command that I was not properly separated. According to my previous command I was extended due to medical reasons. I was unaware of this being done. The reasoning that they are now using is that I was (according to them) undergoing heart surgery. The person that they received this information from was my ex-wife who by chance also happens to be in charge of the separations department. She was the one that extended me with out my knowledge. She based all of this off of e-mails that I (according to them) sent. I have asked several times to review the information they are using in the investigation, but have been refused access to it. My command even after recalling me back to active duty still to this day has not made any formal charges on me, nor have they made any progress in the investigation. I was ordered to pick up a "page 6" from PSD displine office and it stated that I went UA (Unauthorized absence) from 09-11-06 until 11-06-06. Just today (12-01-06) I found out that they stopped my pay with the Navy. When I called DFAS to find out why I was informed that I was separated form the Navy on 11-12-06, but PSD stated that I owe the Navy $7074.00 and that's why my pay was stopped. I have spoken with the local JAG office and when the JAG officer I was working with tried to get approval to represent me she was told that I am back on active duty "making up UA time" and was not able to represent me due to me being past my EAOS (End Active Obligated Service) I have already discovered that my command has violated several UCMJ articles as well as the Navy violating several pay instructions. I have lost my civilian job and I have no funds coming in except my current wife who is on active duty, but at a lower pay grade than me. My new "EAOS" is 01-08-07, but at the rate of this "investigation" I will once again not be allowed to separate from active duty. I have served my time in the military with honor and pride and I feel that I am being unjustly treated and that my civil rights are being violated. I am requesting assistance with this matter as only my direct chain of command is trying to offer assistance. My direct chain of command that is trying to assist me with this matter starts at my Division officer and goes down the ranks. As stated earlier I am a registered voter in Pensacola, Fl and I desperately need your help with this matter.

 Governor Bush:

I have a problem with comprehensive immigration at this time for the 
following reasons:

1) Money for the border fence has not been appropriated and news sources 
report the president plans to disregard this new law as he has with 
previous laws. Remember Dubai or the the 1986 Immigration Act! 2) I do not 
see border security as a immigration issue, but as a national security 
issue. 3) I will support comprehensive immigration only after our borders 
are secured with the help of a 700-mile long fence and employers are 
prosecuted for employing undocumented workers or illegal aliens.

Congress has a history of failing to follow through on immigration 
enforcement and I will not support you or any elected official who 
continues to ignore or prevaricate the issue of immigration enforcement. 
America has become divided by language, there are separatist movements 
forming out west and in Florida. For this, I hold all federal and state 
representatives accountable!

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

My name is Omar Frith and I am a working visitor in your country and state. 
I am on a eighth (8th) month work program (H2B program), from 10/17/06 - 
06/01/07 at a company in Naples Florida. However, so as not to break my 
contract, I was hoping my wife (Kaydian Walters) could come and visit me for 
the Christmas holidays and of such she applied for a visitors visa at the US 
embassy in Kingston, Jamaica and was denied. The reason sited was that she 
has not been working long enough in her present Job.

I am asking you please Sir, (begging you please, smile) if you could take a 
look at my case, and help turn this decision around. I know you have the 
power to do it. It's the season of good cheer, and this would bring for me 
and my wife the best cheers, and joy ever.

I thank you in advance.

Yours Sincerely,
Omar Frith

My letter to SSA below/please read it and help me!

 I am sick and tired of being RIPPED off by SSA and CFS. You sent me $140 
last month. After # trips to my LOCAL office and the first one being a 
joke because of an idiot at the window who it took an hour to finally 
LISTEN to me. I was told that THREE $88 payments to medicare shouldn't 
have happened. AND a supervisor looked at all my bull (overpayments) that 
are ALL made up so you can rip everyone off and lowered one from $60 to 
$10. This was THREE damn weeks ago!!!!! And I went to CFS and got a letter 
saying that I'll get my THREE payments to medicare BACK. I took the letter 
to my lousy local office (SSA) and was told that the letter means nothing. 
That it would have to go through the system.That it could take 45 DAYS. 
But the overpayment garbage should go right in.
 Well same garbage again. I was ripped off an addional $88 for medicare 
and the 60$ overpayment wasn't lowered to $10 dollars.
 So the SSA lied. And last month I had to pawn EVERy damn thing I owned to 
stay in my apartment!! They wouldn't help me at all and now have again 
ripped me off. I will send a copy of this letter to every state and 
federal senator and congres person I can find. And to ever newspaper I can 
find.
 The incompetence at the SSA has ruined my life and has made me sicker 
everyday!
 I am sick of all the lies!

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 As a former resident of Palm Beach County (and still a part-timer with a home in Jupiter) and now a resident of Tom Tancredo's district, I must disagree with your position on Miami's "assimilation" status.  Praising diversity as you do works to a certain extent, but at some point wherever people come from, if they plan to stay (and most do), they must become Americans along with retaining their heritage.  The Wall Street Journal had a article in September about families fleeing Florida.  We did and many others are too for some of these reasons.
 
Several years ago, I saw a shirt which had a slogan which was really sad at the time, but can now be looked upon as prophetic.  It said "Will the last American to leave Miami, please bring the flag."  Hopefully, not all is lost.

Governor Bush, 

I am very concerned about the iIlegal aliens in the State of Florida. What I am most concerned about is they do not follow the rules and lawes of the State of Florida. I understand on the News tonite that Immigration and Naturalization doesn't seem to want anything to do with it. 

Here in the Condo Complex where I live, there is 2 apartments with at least 6 men living in the apartments. There are suppose to not over 4. Our president seems to be frighten of them. We have a ruling about no motorcyles being in here. They have one parked under a stairwell in the apartment.  It has been there at least a month. If a friend of mine brought his motorcycle in I would be fined. I have called our president and written a formal complaint about fining the landlord to no avail. That is why I am writing you. We have certain parking areas .We are allowed 2 vehicles. They have more. We have a ruling no noise after 10pm. I have had to personally tell them to get quiet after hours. The other day I ask them to not play football around the cars. They quit but the next day they were doing it again when I was gone out of town. I wanted them check out to see if they were illegal and called the Dept of Homeland Security. They took the call and said they would tell the dept that was handling this but they weren't doing anything concerning homeland security. I told them they are suppose to be working in construction and yet come back to their apartments not dirty. I also stated that President Bush was wanting to know about people we thought was illegal aliens. I just felt like they blew me off. I'm just confirming what I am hearing on the news and I think something should be done about checking these people out for more reasons than one. We have to follow the rules so why don't they? I live at Sandalwood Condominiums in Wildwood, FL The Spanish people I am talking about live in 22203 and 20201, Sandalwood Dr. Wildwood, FL 

Thank you for the great job you have done for the State of Florida.

The number of illegal immigrants is steadily increasing, straining not only 
the resources available for the legal paying citizens of this great country 
but also causing a deficit generated by unpaid taxes and unmonitored money 
streams. Florida, more precisely Miami, is one of the first victims of this 
immigration problem. And even though part of the economy of this city has 
been built on the work of the immigrants, its holdbacks can be at least 
partly tied to the “illegal” population.
I’d like to point out that I am not targeting the diversity or multiethnic 
character of the state; in fact as of foreigner roots myself I enjoy that 
uniqueness in this part of the country. The problem however is this part of 
the population that stays illegal creating issue not only in the economy but 
also in healthcare, education and so on, and who later will give birth to 
another illegal generation.
We are already aware that Miami is not one of the richest cities 
economically, in less than ten years; the amount of illegal people has the 
potential to outgrow the population of legal ones… this means chaos 
politically and even more disaster economically. Imagine a place where most 
of the taxes that would be used to maintain the city’s maintenance, health 
care, education; the taxes that keep the city alive being used for other 
thing because they are not monitored or reported. Try to imagine crime going 
up because a frustrated majority is being paid “under the table” and under 
the minimum wage and being abused  because of their illegality have to find 
a way to survive and provide for themselves.
We need to do something about this before it is too late; and no I don’t 
believe that we should convict the illegal immigrants or send them back to 
their country where they’re most likely to die of undergo extreme agony. No, 
we should put together a better system that helps the illegal population, a 
system that allows them to actually contribute to their country… but also a 
system that encourages them to contribute to their own country. IF we help 
them, they will be able to help those back home , and not only help he great 
US, but the third world country they’re coming from and the image of the 
United states as an international helper!
Sir, ignoring them, punishing them, or obstructing them will only make the 
problem grow, and sincerely, is quite inhumane when considering why these 
people flee in the first place. We need new policies that will address this 
problem; one that will help the country nationally and internationally, and 
would help these people survive, provide, and contribute to progress. I 
believe, sir, that you can make it happen.
Thank you for your concern and your dedication to the cause
Sincerely,
Dominique Larosiliere

If this is true I would like more information. If this is not true then this would be something that should be looked into especially for those who have unusual and difficult disabilities like myself. 
 
I am on disability and I have lived with loosing all of my sight my whole life. I would like to work but however with this problem it gets harder every year to do so since my sight get worst as the years go by.

Why is it so difficult to provide evidence of Disability Fraud? The Social Security Administration did take my social security number. They typed in the complaint with my social security number. I have to wonder if I now have a complaint against me.  Im not disabled and I dont collect disability. So any investigation about me under my social will come up empty handed and would be a waste of money and resources.

 

 

I went with video proof that my neighbor is committing disability fraud. She collects 100% disability and is supposed to be on crutches. She may be partially disabled but she is definitely not completely disabled. I have other leads about her as well.

 

But when I went to the Social Security Administration office they could not take the information. 

 

Why? They didnt want me to give them her address. Their computer systems wouldnt accept any information without her social security number and I dont have that. I do know where she lives and she gets a disability credit on her property tax. Im not sure but I think they may have some sort of new system that needs to have a way a social security employee can open a fraud case with just a persons name, address, and other identifying information other than just the social security number. Then let the administration track the record and when they find the right social they can enter. 

 

There is a central Social Security Fraud office in Maryland.

 

Also you have to wait an hour or so in a line before even speaking with someone only to be told that they cant help you except to give you the location of the Maryland PO box to send your information to. They should be able to take the information at the branch offices in each city.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush:
 
We recently received the notice of approval of permanent rU.S. residency for my husband, whose previous conditional residency status has been removed, with instructions to obtain a new green card at the Miami BCIS field office.  I am sure you must be aware of the importance of having possesion of a valid green card, particularly for a legitimate, working resident of the U.S. (you can't work, go to school, open a bank account, travel (even on a cruise if it goes outside U.S. waters without one.)
 
I have been trying for a week - 10 times a day to schedule an appointment to get a new green card.  The USCIS appointment website says "there are no appointments available - please try later."  When I called and asked the national customer service line about scheduling the appointment at another office, I was told that is not possible.  That seems illogical since other offices just as close to us do have appointment availabilities.  I was also, "We are sorry - there is just nothing we can do - just keep trying.  You'll probably get an appointment sooner or later."
 
Our notice says it will take “6 months after the appointment to get the actual card and not to travel outside the U.S. until it is received.”  We have travel plans for 6 months from now.  Unless we get an appointment in the next 2-3 weeks, this could potentially affect those plans which would be very expensive to change.  
 
While we are thrilled to finally have the conditional approval removed it is disheartening and frustrating that we cannot make an appointment to have the simplest part of this whole process accomplished.  At this point (after almost 3 years), the case review and paperwork processing is over.  It appears that all that needs to happen, is for a new physical card to be created. 
 
Why can’t appointments be made for the least time consuming and man-power intensive task? 
And 
Why can’t a new card be processed in a timely manner?  If the drivers’ license offices and passport offices all can do the same thing in a fraction of that time, why is there such a big delay with BCIS?  
 
While we know that immigration's backlog is not something you should have to focus on, it has trickle over effects including limitations to your taxpayers' work, education, ability to travel, etc.  We recognize that thru federal initiatives, immigration has tried to focus on being more timely in their processing times.  But 6 months to get a photo id card?  If you can get an appointment to get the 6 month clock started?  Perhaps you can forward this to someone who can provide more insight and possible assistance.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
June and Tony Murton, (relatives of mine) are home owners in Fort Myers, pay taxes, and contribute to the economy of our state in many ways.  They are citizens of England, but Florida is their winter home. 
 
They have many guest visitors from England, who buy our goods, visit our attractions and enjoy our state.  Tourism, as you know, is our main industry.
 
June and her 80 year old father (relatives of mine), flew in from England on Friday, November 24.  They went through Immigration at Miami airport and June was told that she was on the FBI list as she had over-stayed her last visit by 2 days.  This is disputed as she was in the country for 182 days (6 months) according to her passport.  They separated her from her father and detained her in a locked area.  The personnel were very rude, would not let her see to her father's well being, denied her the use of her cell phone, and in general were obnoxious beyond belief.  Conversations were always started in Spanish, which she did not understand. 
 
They detained her for over 24 hours, and escorted her to a returning flight which was held up for an hour.  The irate passengers, who were delayed for an hour because of her detention, were incensed.  She was embarrassed beyond belief.  Her father continued on to Fort Myers on another flight.  Their neighbors will take care of him until Mr. Murton comes over to escort his father-in-law back to England.
 
Needless to say, this flight and many telephone calls were very expensive.  June is a 50 year old wife of a very successful businessman who does a lot of business in the U.S.  She was subject to search, and was told that she was trying to work in this country.  She does not work in England and is and is certainly not looking for a job in the U.S.  
 
The immigration supervisor would not give her a copy of the report of the incident, which she needs to give to an immigration attorney, and have confiscated her visa.  This woman is not a drug runner, or terrorist, and she has no desire to live or work in this country. She was made to feel like a criminal.  The fact that she did not have a return ticket may have caused this problem.  Her husband always travels later  and he buys return tickets so that they can travel back together.
 
At this point they are considering selling the house, discontinuing doing business with clients, and never coming back.  No wonder we are not well liked overseas.  We are supposed to be friends with England, and all we are doing by this treatment is to make enemies.
 
I am hoping that you can expedite the return of her visa, as she would like to enter this country as soon as possible, to accommodate the many visitors she is expecting during the holidays.  Please contact Mr. and Mrs. Murton at email addresses:june murton@hotmail.co.uk  and tonymurton@hotmail.co.uk if there is any information that is needed.
Thank you for your prompt attention.
 
Sincerely

 Hello there Mr. Bush,
 
My name is Yindra Velazquez and I am a permanent resident here in the United States. I have an issue that I would hope you could help me with. On November 1,2006 I paid for a traveler's document "reentry permit", to be done for me. The Nebraska Service Center denied my request for an expedite which I sent to them twice. My mother in law spent nearly $800 on the ticket to Panama because she wants me to meet the family. I am  full time student and worker and this is the only time I will have a chance to travel outside of the country. I understand that this might be minimum to you because of all the other work that you have in your hands but please look over this. I simply need that reentry permit in order to leave the country and come back in since the post office lost my passport. I have no money or time to obtain a new cuban passport and noone else is helping me. I have tried contacting Mel Martinez as well and they are reviewing my case. I really would appreciate if you could do something for me since this will be my only chance to travel and I am only going to be gone for a week. Please please please look over this issue and try to help me. I am currently living with my grandmother and taking care of her so I really dont travel at all. I have only been to New York once and that's all. Please help me with this. Write back with your feedback.
 
Thanks,
Yindra Velazquez

Dear Govenor Bush,
 
My name is Derrick Crooms and I suffer from congestive heart failure ( Cario Malopathy). Which I was diagnosted with November of 2005.  At that time my heart was working at 16%, since then it has risen to 28% plus or minus 5%. I have done everythng in my power but have been told by several doctors that I have improved as much as I will ever. 
My condition keeps me from walking for any distance, playing football with my 16 year old son, or even wrestling with my 4 year old daughter for any lengh of time. I have been diagnosted with severe depression from Dr. Badillio (Psychiatrist). I have had to stop seeing him and my therapist because of the cost. I have also had to utback on my medicine since the co-pays are just adding up. My medicines were up to $300.00 per month. I now take only what is absolutely necasary to survive. 
I also am now going thru a divorce, this is due manly over money.
I applied for Social Security Disability back in Jan. 2006. since then I have been declined several times. Now I am waiting for a hearing. I am told this can take up to 24 months. I can't hold on much longer. I am writing to you as a last hope. P
 
Please help me in any-way that you can. I know that your term is ending and you are looking forward to a new endevour, but do what you can.
 
Thank you,
Derrick Crooms

Subject:	USCIS Causes Great Hardship

 
I would like to strongly voice my anguish at the way the USCIS is handling K3 spousal visas.  My husband who is from the UK and I married in May and filed immediately for the 2 required visas.  Right from the beginning the notice of receipt was sent to an attorney in Orlando that I had never heard of who fortunatley forward the notice on to me.  I called several times to make sure they had the address correct and was told they must have just addressed the envelope wrong as they had my correct address on file.  The receipt date on our case is July 13, 2006 and the number is MSC-06-284-22850.  We have checked daily to see if there was any activity on the website as it is supposed to show if anyone has looked at our forms. All along we have followed many other cases being approved that were received well after ours.  In the meantime we have been visiting each other abouth once a month at great expense.  On November 22 I received in the mail a denial of the visa stating that I had not responded to a request for further information and that it could not be appealled. It still shows never being touched. That is the first paperwork that I ever recieved at my correct address. I think my family being kept apart as a result of a USCIS imcompetency is completely unfair.  My 7 year old daughter is staying in another state with my parents until my husband can come over to live with us do to my working situation as a pharmacist.  We have been telling her to hang on as she desperately wants to leave Missouri after going through a tornado that destroyed my parents and several other relatives homes.  The immigrant visa was just approved at the end of October and therefore we are looking at least another 7 or 8 months until we can be together.  Also do to the error, the $1000 ticket my husband bought so we could spend Christmas together is likely a total loss as it is highly unlikely that he will be granted entry with a visa denial showing when they scan his passport. It seems as though the people working at the USCIS don't even know there own policies.  The worst day of my life previous to the denial is when I called to change my address on both visa's and the person answering the phone refused to change it on the K3 because she said if the I-130 is approved then the K3 is automatically cancelled.  This is absolutely not true.  I called again and the person took the change of address.  Although I have moved it is only very recenlty and would not have affected the mailing of paperwork which supposedly had occured 87 days prior to the denial.  I do not know what further information they were requiring as when I asked they simply state I don't know.  I fully understand the need for proper background checks and that many people abuse the system to get into the states, however I think this mess needs looked into as it is creating extreme stress and hardship on families.  I had no problem with waiting my turn if things were handled in order of receipt (they are not) and in a competent manner.  Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.

My worker has been real nice during the entire process and has tried to keep me informed as best as she can; she said the hold up is on the social security part of my claim, not the disability. 
I am not able to work; I have Severe Coronary Artery Disease/ COPD; if I could have kept working I would have, but I have NO money other than my monthly checks and I seriously need my money; Please, help me.

Señora Secretaria de Estado Rice,
Siento una honda preocupación por el uso de centros de detención secreta –también conocidos como “lugares negros”– que facilitan una política de “desapariciones”, traslados secretos y detenciones secretas en régimen de incomunicación por parte del gobierno estadounidense en el contexto de su “guerra contra el terror”.
El caso de Muhammad Abdullah Salah al-Assad ilustra esta cuestión. Muhammad al-Assad, ciudadano yemení residente en Tanzania, fue detenido por las autoridades tanzanas en diciembre de 2003. Los informes indican que fue entregado a agentes estadounidenses e interrogado en una serie de centros de detención secreta en el extranjero. Permaneció 16 meses recluido en régimen de incomunicación. El trato que ha descrito en el último centro corrobora los testimonios dados a Amnistía Internacional por Salah Nasser Salim ‘Ali y Muhammad Faraj Ahmed Bashmillah sobre su detención en un centro encubierto gestionado por Estados Unidos. Los tres hombres fueron trasladados a Yemen en mayo de 2005, y allí permanecen detenidos sin cargos ni juicio.
Las autoridades yemeníes han dicho a Amnistía Internacional que la Embajada estadounidense en Saná les notificó el traslado de los tres hombres a Yemen y les dio instrucciones específicas de que no los pusieran en libertad. Las autoridades yemeníes afirman estar “a la espera de recibir expedientes” de Estados Unidos para poder someter a los tres hombres a juicio. Un alto cargo de los servicios de seguridad política de Yemen ha declarado que los tres serían liberados si el gobierno estadounidense lo pidiera.
La “guerra contra el terror” emprendida por Estados Unidos se ha caracterizado por el secreto, desde la práctica de ocultar a los detenidos en Afganistán e Irak, pasando por las “entregas extraordinarias”, hasta llegar a la negativa de Estados Unidos a proporcionar datos exactos sobre quiénes se encuentran detenidos en la bahía de Guantánamo. El uso de estos “lugares negros” para facilitar la detención indefinida y en régimen de incomunicación de sospechosos es sólo el ejemplo más reciente de estas políticas.
Señora Secretaria, le insto a:
- desvelar el lugar y la categoría de los centros de detención en los que estuvieron recluidos Muhammad Abdullah Salah al-Assad, Muhammad Faraj Ahmed Bashmilah y Salah Nasser Salim ‘Ali; le insto también a desvelar la identidad y el paradero de todas las demás personas recluidas en este centro, así como su situación legal, y a invitar al Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja a acceder de forma completa y periódica a estas personas;
- poner fin de inmediato a la práctica de la detención secreta y en régimen de incomunicación donde quiera que tenga lugar y sea cual sea la agencia responsable de ella;
- recluir a las personas detenidas únicamente en lugares de detención oficialmente reconocidos, con acceso a familiares, abogados y tribunales;
- garantizar que toda persona que sea presuntamente responsable de un acto de “desaparición” comparezca, cuando los hechos desvelados por una investigación oficial así lo justifiquen, ante las autoridades civiles competentes para ser acusada y juzgada, de acuerdo con el artículo 14 de la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas sobre la Protección de Todas las Personas contra las Desapariciones Forzadas;
- aclarar la situación legal actual de Muhammad Abdullah Salah al-Assad, Muhammad Faraj Ahmed Bashmilah y Salah Nasser Salim ‘Ali, que estuvieron detenidos en secreto. Si la política estadounidense consiste en ceder toda la custodia y el control sobre los detenidos transferidos al control de otro gobierno, Estados Unidos debe manifestar claramente que éste es el caso respecto a estos tres hombres, y debe subrayar que Estados Unidos no ha puesto ninguna condición a su traslado;
- manifestar claramente que no se han puesto condiciones al traslado de Walid Muhammad Shahir Muhammad al-Qadasi, liberado de Guantánamo en abril de 2004 y que permanece detenido en Yemen sin cargos ni juicio;
- retirar todas las peticiones o exigencias al gobierno yemení para que mantenga detenidas a personas, a menos que sea con vistas a procesarlas sin demora por delitos comunes internacionalmente reconocibles y de acuerdo con las normas internacionales de justicia procesal;
- liberar a todas las personas que se encuentran detenidas bajo custodia estadounidense en lugares no desvelados, a menos que se las acuse de  delitos comunes internacionalmente reconocibles y se las procese sin demora y con las debidas garantías, de plena conformidad con las normas internacionales pertinentes, y sin recurrir a la pena de muerte;
- reafirme la prohibición absoluta de la tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, y deje claro a todos los agentes que participen en el trato o interrogatorio de detenidos y presos que esos actos están totalmente prohibidos y que toda persona implicada en ellos será procesada;
- investigue todas las denuncias de tortura y malos tratos de Muhammad Abdullah Salah al-Assad, Muhammad Faraj Ahmed Bashmilah y Salah Nasser Salim ‘Ali, y garantice que toda persona a la que se halle responsable de esos actos comparece ante la justicia;
- prohíba la devolución o el traslado de personas a lugares donde corran peligro de sufrir torturas u otros malos tratos;
- proporcionar plena reparación, que incluya restitución, indemnización, rehabilitación y satisfacción.

Estados Unidos debe poner fin a la práctica de la detención secreta. No es sólo que esas condiciones alienten la tortura y los malos tratos, sino que además el estar “desaparecido” de la faz de la Tierra sin saber por qué o durante cuánto tiempo constituye un delito en virtud del derecho internacional y es una experiencia que ninguna familia y ninguna persona debería vivir.
Gracias por su atención.

Subject:	letter from concerned citizen directed to ICE

Hello, 
If you could please take the time to read this I would really appreciate it. It is about my fiance who was picked up by ICE and my encounters with the rude and unprofessional governement officials that I think you should be aware of. Thank you so much.

To Whom It May Concern:

It is unfortunate that tonight as I, a hardworking and responsible college student sit to begin my research for an upcoming paper, am overwhelmed with concern and sadness. I sit distraught, as I have for the last three weeks, wondering if I will ever feel any better, wondering if I will ever get answers. You see, around three weeks ago, my fiancé and his brother were picked up by ICE at their very own apartment and taken to a local county jail. Ever since then my encounters with ICE have been very dissatisfying, disheartening, and frustrating to say the least. I feel that it is my duty as an American woman, a fiancé, and a friend, to draw your attention today to such a serious and growing problem. Not only am I concerned for my own well being, but for others who may possibly be experiencing similar incidents, who may not have the capability nor knowledge to speak out.
In my opinion, dealing with immigration is very complicated as I'm sure you would agree. However, what amazes me is that when you deal with immigration cases, you take custody over people who have developed lives for themselves, grown as human beings, just as you and I have in this world; have families, relationships, foundations, standards of living. So when you take away one character in the scene of life, you have everything and everyone else remaining, but with a void. Everyone surrounding feel the effects. Now granted I am a firm believer in paying for your mistakes, don't get me wrong, however, my point is that people who are in charge of immigration (transportation, deportation, investigations: ICE) need to be more weary of this fact that concerned family members will be inquiring often. Make our time when dealing with such a devastating period a little easier by just being helpful professionals as you so call yourselves. 
I cannot begin to tell you how unprofessional and rude some of the people I have spoken to who have worked for ICE have been. Today even I spoke to an officer at Nassau County Jail who was very helpful and polite. He agreed when I jokingly said "I really appreciate how respectful and helpful you have been today, what a coincidence you must not work for ICE since you are being so nice today." I even spoke to someone at The Department of Homeland Security who agreed as well that ICE officials were known to not be helpful and possibly be rude. Why would you want to have a reputation as such? I only wish I had taken down those names of ICE employees I encountered, however I've been so frustrated and on the telephone so much over the last three weeks, that I most likely would not have had enough paper to write everything down on. It is sad that I have almost memorized the recording on Krome Processing Center's menu about how they intend to adhere to us, the public in a "prompt, courteous, and professional manner". I've never laughed so hard in disbelief, for it was even a miracle to have someone answer the phone at Krome. But that's sad, very sad. 
Why should it be so difficult to find where my fiancé's property went after he was detained? Why when I call ICE who supposedly are in possession of his belongings can I not get an officer to call me back or answer the phone or for that matter even transfer me to the right person? Why can I not check up on his account to make sure the money I have been sending him has been received? I am a family member trying to find out information so I can get in contact with a loved one! How would you feel if you haven't spoken to your loved one in over two weeks? How would you feel if they were in a completely different state alone and you didn't know how they were doing? My point it is completely unnecessary for me to have been treated the way I have been for the last few weeks. There is no excuse what so ever. I was going back and forth today all afternoon, transferred from one place to another, given thousands of telephone numbers, different names, only to get in the end a bunch of generic recorded menus, no returned phone calls, and thus inevitably a dead telephone battery. It just seems like a reoccurring problem, that no one (most at ICE) has any clue as of what is going on around them, nor care to help you find a solution. I was taught at the age of seventeen even at a part time job in the mall that you always have to come up with a solution. We were always taught that there was an alternate solution so one would say to the customer, "such and such might not work, BUT THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU…" I was taught that was your job as a professional. If part time employees at a mall can get this down then why can't federal government officials? Take pride in your work and do it well. Being who you are you take on a major role in how our country runs, and as a citizen I am very disappointed the way you serve as a  representation of America. 
Something needs to be done to fix this problem. I have never been a selfish person, never ask for much in life, but this struck a nerve and I would hope after reading this letter something be done. I am not happy, not happy at all, that this place I call my home, my beloved country would employ government officials who would ever treat anyone like they have. 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

I  have made several complaints to the postal master about the renovation of this office, they have reduced tellers and put more machines in side which are no good to any one that does not have a debit card or creidt card, pluse the fact that after they close you can not use them. ther is one ONLY IN THE LOBBY which is open. This is the only post office in palm coat AND it a very bussey one also. this needs to be corrected, and put all the machines out in the lobby and bring back the tellers which will service the patrons better. letter mail patrons must stand in line with package patrons just for stamps, they had a station just for that, no longer  this is very fustrating for all of us.  The holidays are going to make it a nightmear.  put it back the way it was and put all the machines out in the lobby!

Subject:	Social Security Card

 
Dear Sir:
 
     I will make this as brief as possible.  My husband Joseph Maggio has been in the US Air Force for the past 24 years.  He had been called to 
active duty immediately after 9/11.  My family moved from Washington State where we had been for 9 years to be closer for my husbands returns from deployment.  He was deployed on and off for two years.
 
    He had an injury and had to be temporarily medically retired for a 1 1/2 years.  He has 6 months left on temp. retirement and then they will reevaluate his conditions to see if he is fit for duty.  
 
   In the meantime, his Washington State drivers license had expired.  We went to Motor Vehicle to get a Fla. Drivers License and there was a problem with his birth date matching his SS # so they sent us to Social Security Office to fix it.  The SS office said they couldn't do anything for him and that he would have to submit for a new card which could take 4 to 6 weeks and then he would be able to get his driver's license.  We have not received a new card  yet.  The SS office treated us like we were illegal aliens.  We were born in this country and as I said my husband has served in the military for 24 years.  As you know when your spouse serves the family serves to some extent also.  
 
  My husband was born in Brooklyn and I in New York City.  We love our country and are insulted and offended at  the way we were treated at this office.  These people are messing with our rights as born American citizens and feel they have a right to.   The problem was an error made by the SS office in 1974 and  they said it was probably a type-o error and they couldn't do anything about but submit for a new card for him.
 
  Next to us on line was a criminal who had broken his parole and had a warrant out for his arrest.  All they said to him was to go see his probation officer and that they couldn't help him at this time.  Why didn't they call the proper authorities?  
 
  We spoke to the supervisor.  Showed her all of my husband military I.D.'s hoping she would give him a letter so we could return to Motor Vehicle and get his license.  She was very short and extremely snotty and said there was nothing she could do we would just have to wait.  To this date we have not received his SS card  in the mail.  My husband called the Washington D.C. SS office and told them of his situation.  They checked the computer and nothing was put through for my husband's new SS card.  We filled out the paper work there and did what we had to do.  
 
  I am outraged at this situation.  Because our government can't fix the influx of illegals, American Citizens are slowly having there civil right being compromised.  These Public Servants are acting like they are God.........I guess they forgot what the meaning of Public Servants means.....

Your Excellency:
 
With due respect to your Excellency, it is my delight to introduce myself and company to you bloke of integrity and unquestionable credibility for onward film business establishment and recognition. I am Michael Segun T. Ojelade Smith a Playwright Artist and Chief Executive Officer of Taureans Film Production, Inc that is based in Lagos, Nigeria and I have eighty-five copyrighted works [film storylines and scripts] to my credit with best intention to produce them in your Country which is the United States. 
 
I had in the past sent some of my works to companies like: Warner Bros, Paramount Communications Inc, The Walt Disney Company, Pathe Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Taurus Film Company, Odyssey Distributors and as well as Hollywood Black Film Festival for consideration in which the said companies advised me to get my works submitted to them through any among the qualified Literary Agents, Producers, or attorney active in the entertainment industry who have had past dealing with them in order to avoid unfounded plagiarism claim. 
 
Based on this advise, I employed the service of a US based Literary Agent named Prof. Barbara Bauer of Barbara Bauer Literary Agency, Inc. 179, Washington Avenue, Matawan, New Jersey. Tel: 732-566-0446, Fax: 732-566-1213, E-mail: cannoliq@msn.com to represent my numerous works in United States and till date, she remains my exclusive agent. I must explain that my agent Prof. Barbara Bauer had thrice invited me and my company’ management to US of which the United States Embassy here denied us of entry visas due to lack of sufficient document that must be approved by the United States Department of State
 
Apropos this declination, I wrote and sent a letter with seven among my works to the California State Governor Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger and sought his assistance and intervention on this matter in order for him to vouchsafe us approbation to enter United States for the presentation of our works to various film producers and companies for consideration. The California State Governor Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger replied through his Constituent Affairs’ Officer Mr. David Chase in which he commended us on our great and excellent works then made it transpire to us that inviting or giving us approbation to enter US or power to grant visas rests entirely with the United States Department of State and that it is outside his jurisdiction, and therefore encourages us to continue working with the federal government to obtain our visas.
 
As ramification to this regard, I hereby solicit your assistance, intervention, and maximum co-operation by means of considering the purpose of our intention to come to United States for the production of our numerous works and to vouchsafe us approbation to enter United States on the same projects. I must have to make this transpire to your high honour that our coming to United States is not to cause detriment or havoc to the government and the citizens of the United States neither to jeopardize the financial and economic growth of the country, but to support and contribute to the economic and financial growth of the United States both federal and states. Due to nitty-gritty that the American Government will benefit through taxation and the United States Citizens such as: Producers, Film Directors, Cameramen, Costume Managers, Location Managers, Lighting Engineers, Actors, Actresses, and other film crew will benefit by partaking in the shooting, acting, and production of the works. 
 
Your Excellency, I must illumine you that most of the countries in the world today which includes the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, China, and France generates their revenue through entertainment and movies industries, and on this, I must have to let you know that he who knows the value of intellectual work is an intellect, and he who is intellect knows the value of creativity, and he who knows the value of creativity will definitely acquire his opulence through intellectual property and creative works. Likewise I want you to know that there is no other country’ foe more than he who has nix to offer or contribute to the financial and economic growth of a country. All I would like you to know is that we see and recognize America as a home for all and a best place for filmmakers, and we must have to come together as one to contribute to the financial and economic growth of the United States in which this cannot be done through laziness, idleness, and selfishness, but through greater efforts, hard work, sincerity, honesty, faithfulness, and integrity.
 
Your Excellency, I want you to carry out proper investigation on this that I stated in this missive apropos how movies and entertainment used to contribute to the financial and economic growth of a country most especially United States. This is because each of the film producers in the world knows the profit they are making on a film let alone hundreds of films that they are producing in a year and after you might have finished your findings on this that I have said then I want you to please cogitate on it and then put this into consideration by means of facilitating our entry visas to the United States. We are promising and assuring you that we will do nix that will tarnish our names and reputation both here in Nigeria and your Country United States if your high honour could please vouchsafe approbation to our coming to United States for the production of our excellent numerous works [films]. Thanks in anticipation of your prompt and positive response to this request.
 
Long Live American President! Long Live American Governors! And Long Live United States of America! God Bless America.
 
Sincerely Yours,

Subject:	MEDICARE FRAUD

I am writing regarding Medicare fraud which occurred on my husband's account in October of this year in the approximate amount of $10,000.00 for medical equipment.
 
The company billing Medicare is a fraudulent company and yet Medicare continues to pay portions of the bill, i.e., rental of a particular type of air mattress at $730.00 a month.  I understand from one of my many phone calls to Medicare another month's rental has already been paid and I have not yet received the EOB.
 
I do not know the company, ZALDIVAR MEDICAL SUPPLY INC., 2500 NW 79TH AVE STE 298, DORAL FL  33122-1092, have never ordered any medical equipment with or without a doctor's order and have received no equipment of any sort.
 
This same type of fraud occurred a few years ago on my account and Medicare was billed for knee replacement parts which it paid for.  I contacted them and protested but it was too late.  The same company did the same thing again a few years later and again I protested loudly by phone and by letters.  Again, once the beneficiary finds out about the paid claim, it is too late.  The check has already been mailed out and cashed.
 
Nothing is happening to stop this fraud which is just the tip of the iceberg.  WHY ISN'T SOMETHING BEING DONE TO STOP MEDICARE FRAUD?  HOW ABOUT A 1-800 NUMBER MANNED 24 HOURS A DAY SO IT CAN BE EASILY REPORTED?  
 
When Crimestoppers first started no one had any idea how well it would work and how much the general public would participate.  Why not do the same thing with Medicare fraud?  I personally will volunteer my time and effort to get such a project off of the ground.  I am sure everyone would be astounded by the sheer volume of false and fraudulent claims which are processed every day.  Even if one claim in one hundred is paid fraudulently it is too much.  With today's technology, this should not be happening.
 
Yet no one is interested in Medicare or otherwise.  I feel like I am just banging my head against a brick wall.  Can somebody tell me why nothing is being done about this crime?
 
I anxiously await your reply.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	US Dollar Coins

Governor:
  I am writing concerning the new design for US dollar coins. I am very happy to see the emphasis on US presidents, especially our founding fathers. However, I am troubled by the relegation of our patriotic phrases, especially "In God We Trust" and "E Pluribus Unum", to the coin edge. I am also concerned that the word "Liberty" is nowhere to be found on these coins. Although this may seem a clever way to make more room for the portraits of our presidents, I think it is actually a covert attempt to hide and eventually eliminate these phrases from our coinage. 
  I am urging you and our US government to demand an immediate re-design of these coins to return our patriotic phrases to the prominance they currently enjoy.

My grandson is nine years old and he was born with cerebal palsy. He has been getting a check for SSI for several years.But recently they discontinued his SSI because they say his father makes to much money. My daughter in law has cancer and she just started getting  a check for SSI  so they say there is to much money coming into the house. Where is the justice? My son is the supporter of six people and his wife has cancer and is in and out of the hospital, his oldest son has cerebal palsy and is in and out of the hospital,my son has lost several jobs because he has to be off work to be at the doctor or the hospital. And the state of florida has the  nerve to say there is to much money coming into the house. Why must my grandson suffer. They do not get food stamps, they do not get welfare, and my son works very hard to make ends meet they really needed the check that Clayton was getting. My grandson is the happiest little boy you could ever want to meet and he is the one suffering because they also took away his medicare. On top of that my daughter in law who is not even his biological mother has cancer,. So she is trying to fight the system and also fight the cancer. They do not ask for anything and they try to keep there spirits up but there is only so much one  can take. 
I am asking for your help as Claytons grandmother to please give him back his SSI  and medical so he can get the help and things that he deserves. 
 
I would appreciate your response to this and I will be anxious to hear from you.
 
Sincerely a desperate grandmother

Good Morning Jeb! 
Not sure if you are running for president 2008; I will vote for you. 
I do have a great idea for the next president, hopefully a republican. 
I have the answer for both the question on the draft and immigration. 
The following is based on the fact that as a Marine in Vietnam with over 35 firefights under my belt I know who should be in a combat situation and who shouldn’t.

It is all about signing up for something or getting dragged into something. In combat you only want people that have made the commitment on their own, they might not always like the crap their in but it was their decision and they usually put it in its proper perspective. For the people who have been drafted; the are usually rebellious to the hole situation.

So how do we make it fair for all? 
You need to have two classifications of military; Combatant and Non- Combatant 
Only people that join the military will be considered Combatant and allowed to go over seas. They will also get paid more and make rank faster.

For the rest “ALL THE REST” every one else; once they have finished high school, mail and female, EVERY ONE will be drafted as a Non- Combatant for 3 years. They will perform all Non- Combatant duties here in the US to in clued: disaster relief and security, border security, riot control, and forest fighting support. Now, when they come out of the service they will not only have tuition assistance but have some idea as to what they want to do with their lives.

ALL illegal migrants must join or be deported, NO free lunches. 
A win win for every one, and the burden of protecting is shared by all. 
Keep up the great work!

October 3, 2006 I received a message while on duty,
stating that my wife was in a car accident. Sk3
Jacinto contacted my chief to let him know what
happened and told me that I was given special liberty
for a day by him. I left from duty to get my kids and
go straight to the Chesapeake General Hospital to see
how she was doing. My neighbor took my kids back with
them while I stayed with her. She was diagnosed with a
cervical spine sprain. I got a couple of calls the
next morning asking the conditions of my wife. That
afternoon I took my wife to get a second opinion at
Hanbury Family Medical Center. Dr. Palmisano
recommended bed rest and to schedule physical therapy
appointments. He said her condition is inflammatory
and is very important that she does little to no
movement, other than eating and using the rest room.
He scheduled a follow up for the following week.
October 5, I was told to report back to the ship so I
can sign my emergency leave chit. I was  given til’
Monday and if I need more days then to just call and
it will be extended.  I spent the next few days on the
phone with both insurance companies giving them as
much information as I can about the accident. I find
out two days later that the driver was not insured and
was allowed to leave the scene in the same vehicle.
Also the trooper who reported to the accident wrote
the accident up as a no fault, yet failed to mention
that there was only one vehicle on site when he
arrived. My car was already towed away and my wife
taken to the hospital. This causes a conflict between
both insurance companies on whose going to pay for the
damages. It also prolonged the process of getting my
car out of the impound to be given a quote to be
fixed. My wife was experiencing some side effects from
the medications she was given.(Itching, vomiting,
dizziness) I called the dr. and took her back in to
see what other medication can be given. October 12, we
had our first follow up with the dr. The neck brace
that was given was still recommended, but he now
wanted her to be assisted with trying get around for
short periods at a time and to follow up on the 18th
of October. Later that day I received a call from my
chief and was given a reminder that my leave was up
and for me to come in and provide them with some
paperwork on my wife’s status. I told them her status
and that she is also scheduled for another follow up
on the 18th. Senior said he’s not going to be able to
keep this up for to much longer and that I need to
find alternate means of care so I can get back to
work. I was on the phone and through the neighborhood
and the base that we reside next to trying to find out
who is able to help and what is offered for her
condition. I contacted family(sister in-law was able
to fly in from Houston from the 25th of October to the
30th), the Chaplin next door(Chaplin Parks also tried
to round up some people in the community. No
responses), Chaplin on the ship, CMC, Tri-care, FFSC,
Chesapeake social services, Portsmouth Naval
Hospital(health benefits officer 953-2611 who stated
that Tri-care does not cover custodial care.). With
that information we contacted Navy Relief and spoke to
Linda who stated that we should ask for a humanitarian
reassignment. I received a call the morning of the
18th from my chief to give him an update on my
situation. I told him that I have a follow up with the
dr. this afternoon and that I can tell him where I
stand. I called him that evening and told him that she
was going to need to be out for another two weeks. I
was told to report to the ship on the 19th so they can
stop my leave and talk about what to do. My division
has allowed me to take my kids to and from school and
to take my wife to the appointments she is scheduled
for. Most recent update was that she could possibly be
out another month. Her physical therapist stated that
her progress physically is getting better but she
noticed some deforming features along her spine. She
referred her to a spine specialist and for her to
undergo aquatic therapy.

Would like to ask you a small questio as perhaps you could direct me to the right department. I had been working for a disable person for the last six years. He had proudly served as a navy corpsman during WORLD WAR II aboard the battleship USS IOWA in the pacific and atlantic theater. My question to you is: What can I do or whom should I contact for him to be given the medals of his service for his country? Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Timothy M. Gleason Jr.
8353 Chad Road 
Macclenny, FL. 32063
 
(618) 363-4311
 
Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
 
I desperately need your assistance. In 2003 I was deployed in Iraq during operation IRAQI FREEDOM. My brother Michael T. Gleason who was in the army and also deployed during the same time I was lost his life in the war. While I was deployed I reenlisted in the military making me eligible for a reenlistment bonus which was paid to me in installments over the years. Two months after I reenlisted in the desert my brother was killed. 
 
Since my brother’s death it has been very difficult for me to manage in the military. I had to be put on numerous antidepressant medications and attend weekly counseling sessions since his death in 2003. 
 
Since I was a sole survivor and unable to deploy because of my status along with the current deployment tempo with regards to the needs of the Air Force, and in addition to the mental stress I encountered I decided to separate from the military on Oct. 13, 2006. 
Before deciding to separate, I checked with my base’s finance office at Scott Air Force Base to make sure I would be cleared to separate under the sole survivor act and not have to repay my bonus money. I was told by the person I spoke to that I would not have to repay the bonus money I received.  As I began to out-process the military I learned that I would have to pay back the military $4200 for the bonus money paid to me. 
 
I find it very unfair that I have to repay this money since people who have separated under the force reshaping program in addition to the ones who are being asked to voluntarily separate because of performance and behavioral issues do not have to repay bonus money paid to them without fulfilling their military obligations. 
 
When I found out I had to repay this money I immediately used my chain of command to request a waiver of repayment of the bonus money I received. Since this is an uncommon issue my commander did not know where to send my request after signing it so they forwarded it to the base legal office. After separating from the military I received a letter from Capt. Brock C. Cima from the Scott Air Force base legal office denying my request. Capt. Cima claims my commander did not have the authority to approve my request. HOWEVER, Capt. Cima DID NOT have the authority to DENY my request. After my former commander signed my request it was suppose to go to the Secretary of Defense to be granted a waiver.
 
I believe Capt. Cima acted incompetently by not sending my request to the appropriate official and by not taking in consideration the vast numbers of Air Force personnel who are separating from the military without repaying bonus money and completing their required military enlistment. 
 
It is a real insult to me and my family to loose my only sibling in the war then afterwards when I ask to separate because of my deployment status along with mental anguish to be forced to repay bonus money that I am not able to afford that others do not have to repay under the force reshaping act. If Capt. Cima had lost his only sibling while he himself was deployed maybe he would have looked further in the Air Force’s policy and realized that a waiver can be granted under my circumstances with approval. It was especially insulting that Capt. Cima insinuated in his recommendation letter that I reenlisted after hearing about my brother’s death to get the enlistment bonus when in reality my brother died two months after I reenlisted. If I could have foreseen my brother’s death I would have NEVER reenlisted.
 
My brother and I PROUDLY served our country and now the military has turned their back on us. I will be doing everything necessary to prove the military’s disregard to my family’s service and commitment including contacting the media if necessary. I will greatly appreciate any assistance you will provide.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mr. Timothy M. Gleason Jr.

Subject:	For the Sake of my Wonderful  Mom and SSI  PLEASE Urgent

Dear Governor Bush, I am desperate for my mom and her situation with SSI. She has not been able to work for the past 4 years.  She is suffering a sever depression and from severe anxiety due to the abuse on her past job of 16 years.  She has applied for SSI benefits been denied, and has an attorney.  After 3 years she had finally got her day in court with her attorney who was NOT prepared. Never even met with her until a month before her hearing. At the long awaited hearing she got to spend about 3 mintes in front of a very rude Judge Robert Droker of Jax, SSI.  He said that since it had been 2 years since he had received previously requested updated medical evaluations he would REORDER more evaluations.  At that original evaluation, their court approved psych found my mom to be severly depressed and much more.  In the process of all this mess she has lost her home. her car, her savings, EVERYTHING that ever meant anything to her except ME and my kids and husband.
 
Based on the needyness of this case it was deemed CHARITY and URGENT 2 years ago. It has now been 36 months and STILL no answers. In March after appearing before the Judge and reordering more test for no reason that anyone (including her lawyer) can understand she was ordered to under go more testing. WHY?   The consult has come back in her favor. After 4 more months of waiting for additional consulting she was finally referred by the Judge to an Orthopedist whom found her to be depressed and suffering from anxiety. We are in receipt of a faborable letter from her attorney based on this Dr's findings, and STILL there is no response from this Judge Robert Droker. WHY? Where do we draw the line when they do not do their job?
 
We have written numerous letters and appeals to WA, Senators, Governors, Congressman, no one seems to care about the well being of my mom. What happens if she commits suicide in the process, who is liable at that time?  I am desperate for her and do not know what else to do. She is desperate for Medicare so she can get insured and seek medication for this severe depression. She was not able to get medical coverage thru the state as she is considered our dependant at this time (we are in the military) and we make too much money based on their scale of who qualifies. (My husband is a Officer in the US Navy and we have 3 small kids.)
 
My mom was a single Christian woman most of  my life. She helped everyone and raised  a Jamaican underpriviledged child. She was a warm, loving, caring woman who volunteered when she had time. She worked in adminsitration for 16 years and was severly abused by the Dr's group practice that she managed. She is now in a desperate position and no one cares. How can a woman who had everything go from that to this and still not be able to get what is due her? 4 years ago she had a 400k home, a great career, a fiance' a new car everything. Now she can barely function due to this illness that has consumed her life.  This Judge needs to answer to someone. Where do we go from here?

I am now writing to you for her and with her permission. Please you are my families last option. I do beleive you beleive in God and we trust in God but there comes a time when someone needs to over see who is running what, especially when someone elses life is involved.  
 
Desperate for my Mom  Deborah Johns ([REDACTED]) case to finally come to and end and allow her the medical care she well deserves. She has worked hard for US how about her?

I have taken care of my Grandma, Grandpa, Great Aunt and My Dad and even my friends fifth stage alzheimers mother,and still my Mom.  When everyone was alive it wasn't so hard to survive.  Now with my Mom just alive the three of us living on 900 a month is very hard.  The holidays are coming again and I can't get my 12 year old hardly anything.  That is horrible.  I no longer have a drivers license.  I could not renew it again because of my SS number.  I have to take mom back and forth to doctors, store and whatever and now I am not allowed to.  I need a job but of course I can't get one.  I can't even go to the ministry for help because again I DO NOT HAVE A SS #   I went to the ss office with my birth certificate , baptismal certificate , marriage license my parents ss#'s  along with my high school transcripts.  Still that was not enough.  They want so much stuff for all the years in between.  Can you please help me.  My Mom even has the orginal bracelet that I was given in the hospital.  I am desperate.  I am not afraid of hard work.  I am willing to do whatever.  Just again I need a ss# and a drivers license.  If I had those two things my life would be so much easier.  Until that time I do not know how we will survive.  I was going to start going to state parks for  a couple of weeks to camp out.  I would love to volunteer at any park in the northwest or southwest of Florida as a campground host. This way my site would be paid for and that would help greatly.  Again I am not afraid of hard work and love to be around people.  So,  Can you please help me out?  At least maybe you can try.  I know that you are extremely busy with running Florida and your own family  .  But,  Please have it in your heart to try to help me.   THANK YOU AGAIN FOR LISTENING, Robbin Dalton   8418 tupelo drive tampa florida 33637      .

Dear Govonor Bush,

     My name is Mark Thomas. I'm writing to you to ask for your help in 
dealing with the Social Security Administration. I have been legally blind 
all my life. I have not recieved any benifits from the SSA for about the 
last six years. I have been activiely trying to reactivate my benefits for 
almost a year now with no success. I've provided all the information asked 
for and waited patiantly for some resolution.

     Things are about to get much more desparate for me though. I've been 
working for the past six months but believe I'll be out of a job come 
January 1st. I've been told descretely by several coworkers that the company 
is in the process of doing away with my position. When this happens I'll be 
left with no income.

     I know there's nothing I can do to speed things up at Social Security 
but I was hoping you might have better luck. It shouldn't take a year to 
restart benifits for someone who is permenantly disabled. Any help would be 
greatly appreciated and if you know of anything I can do please let me know. 
Feel free to contact me if you need any more information or to share my 
experiance with anyone you think may be able to help.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I don't know if you can help, but I need to try and do something.  I know your time is going to be up soon, so you may not feel like helping.  I will try to keep this short.   

My husband, who has worked all his life, had a stroke in May 2001 while working in management for Sodexho Marriott.  The stroke that he had was a blood clot that stopped at the base of his brain, fortunately it stopped or we would have lost him.  Because of this stroke he has memory loss.  He went back to work and after 5 months he found that he just could not remember certain aspects of his job.  Especially when it came to computer work, which dealt with most of his job.  So instead of applying for disability at that time, my husband took a job for $10.00/hour, which of course was much lower than his salary.   

In t he meantime, I was offered a position in another state (Iowa) at a much higher salary (not much) but enough to help us out, so we moved.  My husband tried but was unsuccessful in obtaining any kind of work, as most places gave him computer skills test, which he failed.   

Also, around 35  years ago, he had a cable go through his right leg, and severed the main artery, after several surgeries, a bypass was done and he was able to work but now in addition to the stroke, his right leg now has a blockage, not enough for surgery but this has given him difficulties in walking and standing for long periods of time.   

So while in Iowa our phyisican had prompted us to apply for disability benefits, as he said if there was a case that deserved benefits, it was him.  So in July 2005 we applied, we even spoke to the examiner who said that he did not see any kind of a problem with him getting disability.   

Now comes the sticky part, again I was offered a position in Ft. Myers which meant a little more money so I took the position before any decision was made, and his case was sent to Tampa.  Well as you can tell from this e-mail he was denied, as they stated the reason being he could take care of his personal needs.  Personal needs does not help his memory or his leg problems. (they have all the doctors reports and even a psychological report which disability sent  him which also states that he does have a disability)  He was denied twice and since January we have turned  his case over to an attorney.  On Channel 8 in Tampa this week, they had a segment regarding the long list of names that are waiting for a judge to make rulings.  According to this, it could take another 2 years before we hear anything.  I don't think this is fair to a man who has worked all his life, put into this and now he needs it, and they make us wait.  We are on the verge of claiming bankruptcy, which I don't want to do, but we may not have any choice in the matter.   

We have already used all our savings, any assets we had from the selling of our homes.  There has got to be something that can be done, our lawyer has informed us that it is the luck of the drawer.  They get thousands of appeals a day and if your lucky he will get yours to rule on.   

One other thing, the news report that we saw this week, this man almost had to loose both his feet, and then had 4 heart attacks, after someone called a disability representative, it was determined that someone in the office had a made a wrong judgement.  This should not happen.   

All I am asking is, "Is there anyone that can be contacted so we can actually talk to someone". 

If you can help in any way, we would greatly appreciate it.  I tried your brother, but received no response at all.  

My husband's name and pertinent information is as follows:

Governor of Florida
The Capitol, 400 S. Monroe St.

Dear Governor Bush:

As a practicing plastic surgeon in your district, I am very concerned 
about the deep Medicare physician payment cuts expected in January.  I am 
writing to strongly urge you to stop these cuts and provide positive 
updates before the end of the year as well as seek a long-term solution to 
fix the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula.  Unless Congress acts, 
Medicare physician payment is expected to be cut about 5% a year, 
effective January 1, 2007, through 2015, totaling 37 percent!  When 
combined with the impact of other Medicare changes, many physicians such 
as me are facing combined cuts of 6 to 20 percent in 2007.

It is critical for patients and the physicians who serve them that you:

1) provide a positive update in 2007 to reflect increases in physician 
practice costs, per Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) 
recommendation to Congress, and

2) stop these drastic cuts and replace with a long-term formula that 
accurately reflects physicians' practice costs.

The continued stability of the Medicare program is at stake.  Additional 
cuts will result in a decline in Medicare and TRICARE patient access to 
care, reduction in the number of physicians willing to accept new Medicare 
patients, and states that lose millions in health care dollars.  As other 
plans tie their payment rates to Medicare rates, the impact will have 
far-reaching consequences for patients' access to care and place 
additional strains on physician practices who are already facing declining 
reimbursement, increased practice costs, and rising medical liability 
rates.

Time is running out.  Please act now.  Over 265 members of the U.S. House 
of Representatives and over 80 members of the United States Senate have 
signed letters this year urging that physicians be provided with a 
positive payment update in 2007.  

Stopping the SGR cut will assure that Medicare patients can continue to 
receive the care they depend on and deserve. 

Sincerely,


Richard D Klein, MD, MPH

The reason why I? sending you this mail, I? having a big problem with 
my status.
My story is starting from about 4 and half years ago. I came to America in 
May 2002. And I met my present husband about 2 months later. We were in 
relationship over a year. And we got married in Sep 2003. Since then, my 
status started getting problem. I hired attorney for immigration status 
settle (resident card). But he was not an attorney. And also he didn? do 
his job right (didn? change my address). So I missed my interview in Jan 
2005 that I didn't even know that I had an interview. 

And I filed for appeal. I sent letter saying that why I couldn? show up 
interview and fee for rescheduling interview.  But because of immigration's 
mistake, my case didn't open up again. Later when I applied for renewing my 
work permit, immigration officer told me that my case is closed. Because 
immigration didn't get my appeal letter and fees for reschedule interview. 
Most of time I keep all my documents copies. I found all the copies for 
immigration and they opened my case again and rescheduled. It was in Jan 
17, 2006.

There was no doubt that our marriage is not real. I had all the originals 
of bills and proof of our marriage. I didn't keep these because of my 
immigration interview. But now I? thinking that what if I didn't keep any 
of these, what's going to happen now??? I had my cell phone since June 
2002. How some people that they are not in real relationship or not  real 
married can call each other everyday for hours and hours... My cell phone 
record is showing that I called him or he called me every single day so 
many times. And even after we got married, we called each other every 
single day. But at my interview, immigration officer told me that our 
marriage is not real and they can't approve it. So they denied my case. 

At the interview, officer didn't let us have interview together. They 
called my husband in first then me. We answered some question different. 
How everybody can feel the same way about their closet size? My husband 
thinks that our closet is big enough. And I think that our closet is small. 
Officer said how we think different about our closet size? And also I know 
more about my husband than immigration officer. My husband doesn? 
remember things well. I want to say he really does not put things in his 
head a lot. He remembers our anniversaries and my birthday. Etc. But he 
doesn't remember what year. He doesn't even remember when his brother's and 
sister's born year. Officer asked my husband what year we got married and 
he said in 2004. Which is we got married in 2003. Officer said it's wrong. 
How my husband can't remember what year we got married. Officer doesn't 
know my husband that well. Everybody is not same. And also officer did 
abuse my husband. They put him in the room without me and asked him how 
much I paid him and what I promised him after I get resident card. And by 
racially, too. He is African American and I? Asian. Officer just 
automatically thinks that African American doesn't have money and they 
don't get along with Asian. My husband worked at Chase Bank for 7 years and 
now he is working Humana Insurance Company. He is really hard worker. He 
did take care of me for almost a year when I was not able to work. Also he 
didn't have any criminal record like others. Officer told him that they can 
find that out what kind of criminal record my husband has with one click. 
And also officer told him they are going to put his name on the immigration 
criminal list so he can't do it no more. Officer put her personal thinking 
in business and made wrong decision.   

Anyway officer denied my case. Then we hired the other attorney who 
presenting our case now. His name is Simon Tsang. He copied all the 
documents and letters which is post marked that I had over 800 pages and he 
submitted. And he told me that immigration should give me a notice of 
action in 90 days. I waited for 5month but I didn't hear anything from 
immigration. So in August, I have to apply for renewing my work permit. 

Today 11/23/2006. My status is my work permit is expired. And also my 
driver license is expired too. (When work permit is expired, driver license 
expired too) but my work permit is submitted so I can still work. But what 
about driving? I have to drive to work from Brandon to Oldsmar but I don't 
have driver license. I can't just put myself in house prison. I have to 
make my living. I have to put myself into big trouble, driving without 
proper driving license. I? a hard worker and I pay my taxes. I am trying 
to survive. But because of my immigration status, I can't do it. Even I 
finished my CNA class with best attendant award and second place in class, 
I couldn't be a CNA. Because I couldn't take state exam because of my 
immigration status. I want to be more educated and help people. At this 
point all I can do is just sit and wait until they decide for this obvious 
case. Do they have to think about it for a long time?  And just approve 
other real problem couples case real easily. 

I? innocent person just trying to do and live better than where I am, I 
need some help. I spent a lot of my energy, time, and money. But there is 
nothing I can do at this point but writing this letter for help. I don't 
want to be criminal. I want to live right. Please help me. I need real 
help. 

HELP ME!!!

Thank you for reading my letter and I really hope that you really consider 
this case seriously. I will wait for your respond. 

Thank you. 


P.S. I'm detaching copy of my immigration application and attorney's letter.

COMMENTS: My parents have recently retired and moved to Florida two years ago however they are attempting to bring my Grandmother to Florida so they do not need to move back to South Dakota to care for her.  How can we get my Grandmother to be eligible for Medicare in Florida so she can have medical treatment at the Florida Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville instead of having to travel to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where we have no family to help her?  Is there something we can do to establish residency with us so she will be eligible to be treated in Florida instead? We would rather keep living in the Great state of Florida than for both of our families to have to move to care for our Grandmother.  Thanks for your help!

Please stop the Medicare cuts; I do not believe that many of us will be 
able to survive it. I see a very grim future for access of seniors to 
health care if no changes are done.

I need help.  I need help urgently.  I have turned to all the places that I know, but it is all in vain. I am just hoping that you can help me with this matter.  Mr. Governor you are the highest elected official in the state.  My daughter was born in the state, January 1st 1985.  Within that same year her mother, Jeanne Malvoisin, traveled with her to Haiti since then she has not been back into the state.  About half a decade ago as a concerned father, I have been trying to get my daughter back here in the state.

Dear Governor Bush,

My name is Yan Wang and my wife and I live in Coral Springs Florida.  We are 
writing to you to ask for a small favor.

We are both Chinese immigrants who have lived in the state for almost ten 
years.  We have greatly enjoyed our lives here being with friends and 
pursuing our dreams.  Not only do we fulfill our obligated duties as legal 
residents but also contribute and participate in helping our communities.  
Yet my wife and I don’t have any other family members here in the state and 
we miss them so much especially during the holiday season.  We had tried to 
bring our parents (my side) to come visit last year, but unfortunately their 
visa application was denied twice.  This year something new happened to us:  
our lovely Audrey was born and she is now nine-month old but hasn’t gotten 
the opportunity to meet her grandparents.  And you could imagine how eager 
her grandparents are to hold her and kiss her.  We then decided for a third 
attempt to bring my parents over.  I will be traveling to China this 
Thursday to meet my parents and hopefully my presence could increase their 
chance to receive their visa.

However we are so nervous and concerned that their application might be 
denied again.  That is the reason that we are writing to you to ask for your 
help.  If only you could issue a short letter asking assistance of the visa 
officer to grant my parents their visa.  See attached draft letter.

We understand you must have a very busy schedule everyday and we are sorry 
for such a short notice.  But this matter is very important to us and if you 
could take five minutes to show your kindness, we would greatly appreciate 
it.

Please fax your signed letter by Wednesday (11/22/06) to:

Yan Wang
954-577-4656 /fax

Thank you very much.

Dear Governor Bush:

I write to you today to ask for your intervention in resolving a personal matter. My name is Tatiana Bodor, I’m an American citizen and a Florida resident since 1989, also a republican. On November 21, 2006 my parents Ioan and Maria-Ana David, and my brother Sorin David, citizens of Romania and living there, applied with the American Embassy in Bucharest for a tourist visa to come to my son’s and their only grandson’s wedding. They were denied the visa. 

I would like to explain to you that my parents visited USA in 1992, 1995, 1996, and became permanent residents in Florida in 1999. While in Florida, they were never on welfare, and did not rely on the state for their wellbeing. My brother visited USA in 1996, went back home, and in 2000 came back with a fiancée visa and married an American citizen. His marriage failed, he divorced in 2001 and 2 months later after his divorce, he and  his/my parents returned to Romania, where they currently live. I want to underline that my parents and my brother never overstayed their status, were always legally in the USA, and as such, I don’t understand why they are not allowed to come visit me here. They are law abiding Romanian citizens, and I think they proved more than twice each that they are honest visitors who have no intention of cheating the system. The American Embassy in Bucharest requires one to prove that they have sufficient reason not to immigrate. My parents own a house in Arad, and are retired. My brother has a job but owns no property due to a learning disability. But I think these things are a lot less proof than the fact that they, more than once, had the opportunity to stay illegally, but choose not to.

If you see fit, please intervene on my behalf with the American Embassy in Bucharest, so my family may be together for my son’s wedding which will take place on January 20, 2007. 

 

Thank you for your time and understanding,

Subject:	Social Security Disability Payments

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to you as a final effort to get someone to help me as I am in dire need. I am currently only making $500.00 a month for my Disability Retirement form the U S Govt. as I retired in May 2003 as a federal employee from the US COAST GUARD. I have been waiting (42) FORTY-TWO months for a hearing from Social Security here in Florida.  Isn't there anything you can do to help me? I have written to my Senators & Congressmen to no avail. They all tell me unless I am going to lose my house in foreclosure they can't help me.  
 
I don't think I can go on for another month not being sure if I am going to have food on the table to feed my family every day.  I have been to every food pantry I can go to but most of them are for a one-time service. My spouse is disabled also and has been since July 1987.  She only makes $1,540.00 a month from Social Security.  Since this and my $500.00 a month puts us in to high a tax bracket, but I don't know how, we cannot even get food stamps to eat. 
 
As if that isn't bad enough some of my creditors are calling me weekly threatening me about not paying the full monthly payments on my accounts. Obviously, when I had these accounts I could afford to pay them monthly. However, now that I have been disabled for over 42 months with no hope for a hearing in the near future from Social Security, I am really getting hassled from my creditors. I don't know if you can help me, but I don't know where else to turn for help either.  I had even considered writing to your brother, but I think he has enough problems going on with the WAR.  He probably doesn't have time to consider my trivial problems.
 
If there is something you could do to rush or expedite this process along I would sure be in your debt.  I also want you to know I voted for you & if you could've run for Governor again, I would've helped re-elect you again, too. However, please don't let that be a factor in helping me as I am just another Floridian looking for answers with no where else to turn at this time.
 
Please let me know if there is any other information you need to address this situation for me. I appreciate you taking the time to at least look into this situation. I hope you have better results than I have had to date.  Also, I have a 16 year old son who is now trying to find work so he can help put food on the table for us.  I know it sounds trivial, but I haven't been able to even have a birthday party or a Christmas for him in four years.  He seems to understand but I feel so awful as a parent that I don't know what to do for him. I am not trying to get sympathy but I sure could use some support in any way, shape or form.
 
Thank you for listening and GOD Bless your family this holiday season ! ! !

Florida Governor Jeb Bush thanks you for your e-mail about daylight saving time.  Governor Bush appreciates your expressing your opinion.

 

Many years ago, the Florida Legislature voted to comply with daylight saving time.  If you believe this decision should be changed, please contact the members of your local legislative delegation.  Any changes to the federal law itself, such as the date on which daylight saving time begins, would require an act of the U.S. Congress.

 

Since its inception, daylight saving time has been a topic for debate.  Many people have strong reasons to support or oppose daylight saving time.  For example, farmers and business people may favor it.  Parents, however, may express concern for the safety of their children going to or from school in darkness.  Those who feel strongly about daylight saving time as it applies to school attendance hours should contact members of the local school board.

 

Once again, thank you for sharing your concerns with Governor Bush.

Dear Sir,

 

Is there any way to vote against the time change? When we lose daylight savings in winter, I get home from work at 6pm and it's already dark. I have a small child and work full time. I have no outside time with my son. Our society is getting more and more obese due to lack of activity. Couldn’t we at least try to do something to help this? I know the time change was originally so that business could spend less money on electric for lighting; it seems they have it backwards, we loose an hour and it gets darker earlier??? How is this saving electric?
Your response to this question is appreciated.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am hereby requesting your assistance to expedite the processing of my application for permanent residency that was filed on November 3rd, 2004 by my employer Tech Data Corporation.  The Texas Service Center of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has informed me that they are still waiting for the FBI and CIA to complete the required background check on me.   Although I clearly understand the need for this process step, my attorney has informed me that, a couple of months ago, the Texas Service Center was processing employment based AOS cases like mine that were received in November of 2005, one year after my filing.  Thus, my case has been unusually delayed by the FBI and CIA background checks. I respectfully request your assistance with those two agencies to expedite the investigation so that Immigration can proceed.  My Pertinent case information is listed below. Thank you very much for any assistance you may be able to provide me.

Dear Sir,
I bag your pardon in advance as my request will probably surprise you.
My wife and I have submitted an application for the DV-2008 lottery. We still are unaware whether we win or not. In case of negative response, could you please try to support us in the problem of moving to the USA. Are there any other legal ways for that?
My professional field is computer software and web design; my wife has the distinction in English and French (teaching and translating)(we both have university degrees).
Hope you could inform us in case there is a variant suitable for us.
Would not you mind, please, consider this letter.

My name is Susana Gonzalez, a Mexican citizen and the mother of twin 10 year 
old american born boys who has resided in Lake County for 11 years. The 
reason I am e-mailing you is "I need HELP"! I have been seperated for 6 
months from an abusive, 11 year marriage and I need my resident card. For 10 
of the 11 years I have resided here I have followed the proper procedures to 
receive it but have had no such luck so far. I have had an immigration 
attorney for 8-9 of those years but he has gotten me no where. I have filed 
a domestic violence report with immigration against my sponsor so now I do 
not have one which means I must sponsor myself. Soon my drivers license and 
my work permit will expire leaving me with no way to transport OR support my 
children. After all these years immigration tells me "wait, your case is 
pending". I have only used free US services at the time of birth of my twins 
and I'm not looking to "free load" on the American society. The only thing I 
wish to be given to me is my papers! As an understanding parent like myself, 
what guidance/help can you provide me with immigration or my drivers 
license? Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family and I look forward to 
hearing from you soon!!

THANK YOU!

This is an immigration issue, my brother was taken by immigration officers almost two weeks ago in Broward County South Florida, he came to the USA when he was underage from Colombia more than 10 years ago, he was pursuing a Political Asylum case since my family was persecuted, has been paying his taxes through the years, married, has an American baby, I submitted a family petition for him couple years ago. He was taken and treated as Criminal, since two days ago we have not idea when they have him, We were able to talk to him couple times last week but we know that he was moved somewhere. Please let us know what is the plan for this people that immigration officers are deporting, I know the republican government is showing this as a country protection, my brother was not illegal, he was in a process... he has been helping people around him all his live and have not criminal record. Please help us!!! His baby girl is sick and does not want to eat, the mother is desperate, he was the house head and now she has to leave her apartment since she does not work and bills do not stop coming. How can they do this to a family, people do not believe how this can happen to such a good person!  

I understand as an American Citizen we all want to protect our country, but… I do not think this is the way to treat a person that was under a process and has been doing everything right, he came to protect his life thinking this was a fear Country and opportunities, yes it is and I want to keep thinking the same way, but if you are going to deport someone why it takes so long, why the worst criminals have the right to a bond and communicate with family, why we are not informed on anything? Why they do no let him go and gave them the opportunity to stay. 

Cases are different and we do not expect amnesty to illegals, when he came, he did not know this country laws and I am sure no body know all the laws specially for a country that is not their own, for a country that does not speak their own language! Please understand we are here for a reason, most of the family members are here legally. Did the pilgrims came here with documents or visa? 

Immigration is committing many abuses to the people they are taken, some of the officers laugh, joke and take advantage of their status, since  my brother is not a USA citizen, is he suppose to get all this? Please help us, we want to think this country is really fear and family values are important, I will have my baby in the next weeks and my this situation has change my life completely. 

Thank you and as always God bless you and guide you in all decisions you take for people.

Hello sir.

I am an offshore worker who is a British citizen.  I work in the North Sea on a diving support vessel.  I have a well paid job, a partner who I have been living with for 10 years and a six year old daughter.  I went to college in Iowa and I played American Football.  I love the United States and it is my dream for my family and I to be able to live there.  My best friend lives in Fort Myers, Florida and it is here that I would love to be able to live.  I know that your country has very strict rules in place to protect the American people and it's workforce.  I am not wanting to come over to your country and be a burden on society, or take a job that an American should have.  I just would like the opportunity to live there.  I feel that I am in a unique situation.  I work offshore for around 6 weeks at a time.  I then usually get around 3 weeks off.  My partner is a full time mum to my 6 year old daughter and would also not be looking for a job.  We would therefore not be looking to take jobs away from the American people.  I would want to buy my own home, car, pay state and local taxes, and also pay for my daughter to go to school.  I would therefore be putting money into your economy, and not take anything out.  My job would still be here in the UK, and I would continue to pay UK income tax also.  

I have tried in vain to find out what it is I need to do if I am going to achieve this dream.  I have not had any success so far and I keep hitting dead ends, so I was wondering if you can help me in any way, or point me in the right direction.  I shall list all my family details below and hope to hear from you in the very near future.

Many thanks

Subject:	Help!!! My family is facing seperation

I greet you in the precious name of Jesus. The purpose of my letter is in regard of my husband Kemson Lundy case # A-72-766-442. A decision the board made on 5-3-04 concerning my husband has had a devastating impact on our family. On November 01, 2006 my husband was detained in Detroit, Michigan in front of me and our four children. He is currently in Monroe County Jail in Monroe, Michigan awaiting deportation.
The situation is that he is happily married with four beautiful children. Kemika Lundy (10), Joanna Lundy (7), Kendria Lundy (4) and Kenric Lundy (7mth).  Kemika had to spend her tenth birthday without her father. And my husband Kemson had to his 35th birthday in jail. I and my husband have been together since I was seventeen years old. We have been together for a total of 11 years.  
            For the past eleven years he has been the soul provider for the family. He has been there for the delivery of his children. When our son Kenric had surgery at the age of two month, he was there in the hospital with us. I suffer from migraine headache, tonsillitis, and after I gave birth to our son I develop a serious case of hemorrhoids. When I have these attacks, I can’t function due to the severity of the pain. During this time Kemson is the one that provides for the children. During the night when I can’t sleep due to pain, he takes care of the baby. Even when I go to the hospital he takes care of our kids. 
            My children are so attached to their father.  If my husband is late coming home from work the children begins to question me on his were about.  My husband is a loving, caring, hardworking father. He always wants what is best for the family. He always put his family first. My husband has never been in trouble with the law. He has a clean criminal record. He has worked in the country for the past twelve years and he has paid all of his taxes. He is a great Christian and a child of god. He is the Maestro of two Christian groups, Lavoix du7eme Ange and New Inspiration. He has produce two Christian album with lavoix, and not too long ago one album with New Inspiration. He is well known among musician friends and numerous of churches. 
            This issue has been devastating not only for me but for my children also. My ten year old daughter Kemika was crying for a while. But now her tears has stop but she is having mood swings like crazy. My seven year old Joanna has a lot of anger lock up inside of her.  She can not understand why her father is in jail. And why are people trying to take her father away.  I have to hear my seven year old  daughter talking on how she think these people are stupid, how she wish the were dead and how she wants to kill them. I have to let her know that we are Christians and she can’t think that way. My four year old Kendria, I can’t even leave the room with out her knowing were I am going. We went to church after her father was detained and after church my sister in law pick her up from children’s church. She went on the playground with her sisters and cousin. When it was time to leave the children left the play ground. All of the sudden we did not see her. A fellow church member spotted her and brought her to us. When I ask her where she went, she told me that she went looking for me. That she taught that I left her too.   My seven month old son Kenric keeps on calling “dada” and he would look around to see where his dad is coming from. When my husband calls from jail and talks to him on the phone he begins to call “dada” and clapping his hand and starts kissing the phone. It breaks my heart to see my children hurting. They want there father.  See I do not know if you have any children or if you ever went with out a father. I know what it is not to have a father around. My father abandons me when I was fourteen years old. As a result I started seeking fatherly love in all the wrong places. At the age of fourteen I got pregnant and had an etopic pregnancy.  When a daughter does not have her father in her life there is a void that is formed in her heart. I am now twenty-eight years old and finally God had me work on some of my feelings and I have finally resolved my feeling. And god has filled in that void that I had in my heart. I am very concern for my son. He needs his father in his life. I do not want my children to be another statistics teen pregnancy, drug dealing, drug using, gang banging, steeling, prostitution, theft, etc. 
            I know you are probably thinking why she is wasting her time with this letter; we have already made our decision. But I say that he may be another number to you or just another immigrant. To me he is the love of my life. The father of my children. My better half. He is my gift from above. He is the husband god has for me. He is the husband every wife would ask for. He is the father every child would want. Most of all he is god’s child.   I can not imagine living life with out him. What god has put together let no man separate.
            One thing I know with god all thing are possible. And I know that god is going to release my husband. The question is will you allow god to use you as a vessel to do his work?   The greatest gift for my children this holiday is there father being released.  I want to thank you for your time. And for the release of my husband!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
May the peace of god be with you? May god answer the desires of your heart? And in the area you lack, that god will fill and provide. I declare and decree healing and blessing on you and your family members. I speak against any strong hold that may try coming against you. I also declare and decree conviction of the Holy Spirit and salvation to those who need it. I declare and decree gods favor over your lives. I declare and decree that god purpose shall come to pass and gods’ glory shall manifest in the precious name of Jesus. Have a blessed day and may you walk with gods grace and favor on your lives.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
                               I served in the Army from 28 Feb. 1989 to 18 Nov. 1993. I am current in the Air National Guard out of Dothan Alabama. The reason I am sending you this e-mail is because I have recently applied with a civilian company called ITT to go over seas as a civilian contractor in Iraq. In the process my security clearance was denied and know one has told me why. I need help finding out why I was denied and if there is anyone who can help me speed up this process for I am currently unemployed. Any help anyone could give me would greatly be appreciated. I have always served my country and will continue to serve to the best of my abilities. God bless you and God bless America.
 
                                                                                             Sincerily,

Dear Govenor Jeb bush,
               I realize that you are no longer the Govenor of Florida, but 
I had gotten your e-mail address from a web site. I've  read on the wesite 
that i found your same e-mail address on, that you support the bill or you 
were trying to get the bill passed for undocumented immigrants to get 
drivers licenses in the state of Florida. Well I wanted to tell you my story 
and I hope you can help because I really need it for my soon to be husband. 
I met my boyfriend in the year of 2005 in May, we've been together for 
almost 3 years, he once had his drivers license for 2 years and he was 
pulled over because of some stupid reason, the police officer that pulled 
him over told him he was speeding and changing lanes with out proper 
signals..I know for a fact that he did not do any of those, So the police 
officer took his license and told my boyfriend he was not allowed to drive 
anymore. Well i didnt have a license or a permit yet and the only way for 
him to get to work was to drive, so he did. I know it was stupid of him to 
that, but he had to go to work and make money to pay for all of his bills 
and rent, water, car insurances, cell phone and house phone, the whole nine 
yards. He was then pulled over again, and the police officer gave him the 
same story that the first cop gave him but he added more, that he wasnt 
wearing a selt bet and his car tags were expired. Which i know for a fact 
wasnt true, because im always on him about the selt belt and tags being 
expired.  He was always on top of everything. The cop told him that if he 
was cut again he would be sent to jail. He's been to court twice already and 
he had to pay the fines, which was okay with us, as long as they didnt take 
him away from me. Well Feburary of 2005 i found out i was pregrant. He was 
so happy but he was still worried that if he was pulled over he would never 
see his unborn son and would never see me. In April of 2005 he proposed to 
me and i accepted. So we are now trying to plan a wedding but i just found 
out that he cant get married to me because he came to this country 
illegally.  He hasnt been pulled over in almost 10 months. He's been good 
about everything and extremely careful. On my son's first birthday which was 
November 9th 2006, we were pulling out of our apartment, and yet another cop 
followed us and about 2 miles down the road, he put on his sirens. He had 
pulled us over. He asked my boyfriend which is name is Jose, for his drivers 
license, he told the cop he didnt have one, the cop asked me if i had one, 
which i did, i had my permit, but it wasnt on me at the time it was in my 
apartment, so he asked Jose if he had anything in his car that they should 
know about and he answered NO because there wasnt anything, so he asked for 
premission to search the car, so Jose and I got out of the car, left our son 
in the car seat, and they searched in the car, they didnt find anything. The 
police officer said he is not to drive his car or any other car, he has to 
go to court Friday 11/24/2006 in st petersburg. And what scares me the most, 
is that i might not see him again, and he will never see his son, im adfriad 
that he will be sent to Tampa and be deported from this country back to 
Mexico. I know you probably cant help me because its probably to late. But i 
was just hoping that you can help me to get him a drivers license, just 
incase he doesnt get sent away. So please dont think this is some lie to try 
to beat the system because i know i cant beat the system, I'm just looking 
for help. If there is any way you can help me and my family stay together, 
or know any information that could help us, please e-mail me back asap. I 
appreiate you taking the time out of your busy scheudle to read my e-mail. 
And im looking foward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks again for your time,
Sarah Robinson

Mortgage rates near 39yr lows. $510,000 Mortgage for $1,698/mo - Calculate new house payment

Governor Bush

	I am a veteran of OIF (war) and OIF-III; I have served with pride and honor
for your brother (I have been awarded two Bronze Stars one with Valor
Device). I am proud to have served and would gladly go back. After returning
from Iraq this past January, I came down on assignment to Embry Riddle
University (ROTC) in Daytona Beach. I have come across a case with one of
our cadets; to give you a quick brief, she is an outstanding cadet with
unlimited potential and a very sound mind with the dream of being an Army
officer. Literally that is all she wants to do in life. She was born in
Havana, Cuba but parents moved to Florida, she does have an alien resident
card and a social security card; additionally she is a resident of Florida.
She has done all the proper paper work to become a U.S. citizen. Her
application was received and processed on 25 June 2005 and was interviewed
on 9 February 2006. The delay has come in her background investigation. We
have contacted both Congressman in our district by the school and the one in
her parent’s residence, however this came to no avail. She will need to have
her citizenship before we can contract her and retain her in the ROTC
program. She has continued to be a model scholar and cadet despite all these
setbacks. If we cannot contract her by the beginning of the next semester
(January 07) she will not be able to continue on as a cadet. This is an
injustice to a prospering future soldier and leader, how hypocritical is the
U.S. to allow illegal immigrants, who do not wish to defend this great
nation, all the benefits that they are entitled to, however we tell an
actual resident that we can not make her case a priority just because she
wants to become an Army Officer. The Immigration Department in Tampa Bay
sent an e-mail stating she had to be enlisted or already be commissioned,
well how can she commission if she is not a U.S. citizen? Any resident of
the U.S. can enlist but the special bread become officers. I am an enlisted
infantry soldier of almost 20 years; I believe I am an expert on the subject
of what a great lieutenant should be. Ms Jimenez possesses the skill, pride,
discipline, desire and down right American grit that officers must have. I
am asking you as a personal favor to a veteran, please help Ms Jimenez
become a U.S. citizen. I have never asked my government for anything
personal, however, this injustice has motivated me to seek evenhandedness.

Dear Govenor Bush,
For the past year we have been trying to get a lady here legally from Colombia South America.  We have gone through a mountain of paper work and each time she goes to the embassy in Bogota there is something else wrong.  She has another, and probably the last time she will try, appointment with them on the 9th of January.  Is there any information that you could forward to us that might make this the magic appointment so she can come to the USA.  My son and her are really in love and we as a family have all been to Bogota and met with her family and they are really lovely people.  Why do they make it so hard to get somebody here leagally?  Hopefully you can find the time to help us with some answers.  
Thank you sincerely,

Dear Gov. Bush, 

I know you are a very busy person and most probably this is being read by one of your staff...that is fine...but I would like them to please inform you of my letter also. 
I am 58 years old and unable to work due to many different health conditions; at the top of the list is I am morbidly obese(332lbs) and have congestive heart problems, high blood pressure, asthma, osteoarthritis, borderline diabetic, chronic fatigue syndrome, high cholesterol, and I am depressed. I am also trying very hard to survive in a world where it is almost impossible to get my disability social security approved in a timely manner. I began with my first claim in 2003. It was denied. I tryed to find a job I could hold out to do, but I could not. I tryed again in 2005. Again the same story. This year 2006 I have again tryed by filing my claim...let me also say..that I would much prefer to work and even went to the disability rehab counselor to help me find a job, but they advised me that since I had already filed for disability ssi, they could not help me...I now live in public housing..thank God for that..for a while I was homeless, but was taken in by a friend who owns a Assisted Living Facility and since I could not pay, I simply slept in her office recliner and was fed till one of her staff helped me apply for public housing..I have worked for over 40 years and contributed to all my tax obligations..I have never been arrested or committed a crime, I am a good solid citizen and in the past never ask anyone for anything. I have been living off handouts for food till May of this year when finally I apply for Food Stamps as I was so desperate and they gave me a card in 3 days...it was so obvious to them of my need...why is it not as obvious to social security. I am an educated person..but what good is an education if you cant sit up for very long or walk across the room without being totally out of breath or need help to do your simple house keeping tasks..and I am a very proud person..many times I have not ask for help and just endured whatever the day brought my way. I am begging you for help. I need help Gov. Bush. my ss is [REDACTED]/  I give you and your staff permission to access any information on me you want and review my case or anything..but please , please help me ..I dont deserve this kind of treatment.

Dear Jeb Bush:
 
                       First of all, I am really appreciated that I have this oportunity to contact such an important person like you. Thank you very much.
 
                      My name is Carlos Florean, I came from Cuba on november 2nd of the last year, to joing my family here, after Castro released me from his regime. Since I came here, I have been working very hard, and attending to school at the same time. In one year, I have three certificates, the first one is in "Medical Billing", the other tow ones are related to car insurence, home insurance and life, health and annuities. I have  done here on Florida, on one year, more that I did in Cuba all my life.
 
                   However, I'm missing a very important side of my life, and is my girlfriend. Her name is Magbis Pupo, I met her in Cuba one year before I came, we agreed to engage and meet here, becuase her father applied for a refugee visa on Havana. The first answer was very positive, and was told that on January 26th of this year, they had the final interview. The interview was cancelled to be schedule two months later, but the have never contact my girl's family. Is been more than one year since I left Cuba, and don't see that my girlfriend is coming.
 
                 I'm taking this oportunity to ask for you help, trusting on your good will and your deep knowledge on government procedures. Here is the case number on Havana Interest Office, on the Refugee Section, CU 48434,   the primary case holder is my girlfriend's aunt, and her name is Zoila Pupo.
 
                 My address on Florida is.

I agreed, we went to the hearing in January of 2006 and my father was awarded  Supplementary Social Security Back pay going back to 2002.  He was awarded just under $12,000. A few months had past and my mother received a check for around $3,000. I called the SSI office and asked why she only received a partial payment and they said because they had separated in January of 2004 that she was not entitled to the rest of his back pay. So I call them and let them know that I was my fathers only child that I would be entitled to the rest of his back pay. They said no , only he or his spouse can collect it and being he is dead and your parents are divorced the state would be keeping the remainder of the money. This may be the law, but I do not under stand , if it is back pay, "which is pay he should have received while he was alive " he would have left the money to myself and my mother.  But since they waited for him to die they get to keep nearly $8,000 dollars of money that is owed to him and his family. I understand that we shouldn't receive monthly SSI checks on his behalf since he is dead, but the back pay should be paid to the family. Please let me know if you can help, or if you know which office I can contact to get some  help.  It may be a law like the SSI office said, but its not a good one if it is. I can get you specific information if you need it. 

Thanks and God bless,

Subject:	Issues of today (school assignment, please read)

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush:

My name is Regis Giles and I am a home schooled student of Florida Virtual School (FLVS). One of my classes is American Government and what I am studying now concerns key issues that are occurring present day. I decided I would study more on immigration, which comes to the reason why I am e-mailing you. I was asked to question some of my elected representatives on my issue that I decided to study further. So, if you don’t mind, here are some questions I would like you to answer.

What are your most strong opinions about immigration? What kind of immigration are you for? How have you voted on bills related to immigration? How important is this issue to you? Do you belong to any of these interest groups: US Boarder Control, Americans for Better Immigration, or National immigration Forum? What are your opinions about these interest groups?

Thank you very much for reading my e-mail, I hope you didn’t miss an appointment because of me. This issue is very important to me and I think it should be important to every American because immigration affects so many aspects of our lives. Again thanks for your time and have a great and productive day.

Sincerely,

Regis Giles

Subject:	New wife looking for dual-citizenship from Canada

Dear Jeb,
 
My wife and I just got married in in Tampa in Hillsborough County on Oct. 21st and are having a difficult time with getting her name changed. There seem to be many layers of red tape involved because she is a resident alien from Canada with a green card. We tried to get a joint bank account with her new name, but they require a new driver's license. The DMV requires a new green card. Green cards take weeks or months, but we need to start using my surname so she can have a 'legal' name change. The only information we can find about changing names is that you start using it after getting married. The problem with that is getting a valid state ID that institutions recognize.
 
Is it faster and/or less expensive (a green card is $190 + $70 for biometrics) to apply for citizenship now that she is married to a U.S.-born citizen? If so, what is that process and what costs are involved by taking that route?
 
Also, is it acceptable to have 2 middle names by adding her maiden name as a middle name? She would like to become Kristin Elaine Reilly Petersen so on a document or filling forms with a first and last name field, she can use Petersen, but not lose Reilly without the bother of a hyphenated last name.
 
I think you did a great job as our governor and I hope Charlie Crist can keep things rolling for the Republicans and our state.
 
Thanks so much for your help in our matter,

Dear Governor Bush,

 

My name is John Stevens. I am a resident of Winter Park and am self employed as an architect/builder in Orlando, Florida. I was wondering if you had any leads on how someone might get involved with the White House Christmas decorating team. 

 

My wife Susan Ann Stevens is a very talented architect herself and has a real gift in design and holiday decorating. Ann is active in here community, she presently sits on the Winter Park architecture design guidelines task force and used to be Chairman of Winter Park’s Historic Preservation Commission. The point I am trying to make is that she has a real understanding of “old world charm” and I think that would be a perfect fit for the White House Christmas decorating team. She has seen on TV (home network) how they decorate the White House in Washington DC and has told me that would be a dreams of hers……..to go up there and participate.

 

Since you have the family connection I was hoping you could give me a name of someone to contact……I know they would have to do background checks, etc. so I don’t expect it would happen this year, but maybe in a year or two? 

 

Hope your holidays are full of cheer.

served "on the line" in country. If you do the math, you will find  
that this is a very small percent. The "real deal" Veterans are few

Subject:	Re: deportation concern

 Dear Governor Bush,
 
 
 
             My name is Amikam Ribak.  I came to the U.S. in 1967 at the age of 19 to visit my parents and younger sisters.   I stayed in New York and got married in 1968.  My first son was born in 1969.  I opened an alarm system business in 1970 and purchased my first home in 1971.  I got my green card in 1971.
 
            In 1983 a friend was involved in bank fraud and I plead guilty to only knowing what he was doing. However, I was charged with conspiracy to commit bank larceny, received a two year  sentence, and served one year in jail. Prior to being incarcerated, I assisted the FBI in finding a co-conspirator on several occasions, while being wired.  I recently contacted the prosecutor at the time, David Zornow, and he offered to write a letter of recommendation and help me in any way he can. 
 
           In 1985 I remarried and have three more children with my wife.  I have had no further criminal problems.  I have been in the taxi medallion business since 1983.  I also owned a laser printer company.  Since 1991 I have been disabled due to an eye injury and fourteen surgeries as a result.
 
          We moved to Florida in 1993 and sold the businesses in New York.  We reinvested in the cab and real estate business here in Florida.  
 
          In 2005 I went to the immigration office to renew my green card. I completed all necessary paperwork and was told I will be contacted.  I was scheduled for an appointment in September of this year.  When I arrived I was arrested and held for two days in a detention center.  I hired a lawyer and was released on $3,000 bond.  Now I am in danger of being deported and must await
a hearing date with an immigration judge.
 
         Fortunately, I am under a 212C provision that applies to people like myself who plead guilty to less than 5 years in jail before 1996.  I have many positive factors including good character references, strong business and family ties, and years of community service to my benefit.  
 
        I have lived almost 40 years in America, much more than I lived in my native Israel.  My oldest son was in the US Navy and I feel this is my country.  Unfortunately I never applied for citizenship, although my parents and sisters did.  Everyone I know and love is here.  I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.  My health has been adversely affected due to the unbearable stress.
 
       Please consider my situation and help me in any way you possibly can.  
           
 
        
 
 
 
              Thank you,

Good afternoon sir,
 
My name is Michael Vasbinder, and I have just got out of the Navy in June, 2006.  However, it has been brought to my attention that my ex-wife, Jessica Silverthorne, has been using a military dependents ID card to access the military bases, NS Mayport as well as NAS Jacksonville.  It is my understanding that once I had been discharged from the United States Navy, that all benefits from the United States Navy were to be forfeited.  I also believe that she was using the last name Vasbinder to gain benefits not only in Florida but also, Texas and Louisiana.  We have been divorced since September 18, 2006, so therefore she is no longer entitled to use the last name Vasbinder.  I had informed the military police on NS Mayport of the situation, to which no action has been taken to rectify the problem.  I had also contacted the base legal department informing them of the situation because of the sensitivity of the issue and was told that there was nothing that they could do about it because I was no longer in the Navy.  I have also contacted the base housing office to inform them of the situation because she is living with an active duty member to whom is stationed on the USS JOHN F KENNEDY, which is homeported in Mayport.  Basically, I was wondering if there was anything that I may be able to do from this point to try and rectify the situation before any further damage is done to my name?
 
Thank you in advance for your understanding.
 
Sincerely,
 
Michael Vasbinder

Thank you for your recent letter asking for assistance in obtaining 
affordable housing.
I appreciate the opportunity to respond.

As you may know, subsidized housing programs are under local and/or federal 
government control, and your best source of assistance is the executive 
director of the housing authority.  I suggest you write or call that person. 
  His or her address and telephone number can be found in the local 
government section of your telephone book.

I cannot help you with medicaire, that is a federal issue.  I am, however, I 
am forwarding your concerns to the Department of Children and families.  You 
may be eligible for medicaid, which is a state program.

The Florida Housing Finance Corporation's First Time Homebuyer Program makes 
purchasing a home more affordable for low-to-moderate income families and 
individuals by offering fixed, low-interest rate mortgage loans.  In 
addition, Florida Housing also offers up to $14,999 ($25,000 in high cost 
Counties) to assist eligible borrowers with their down payment and closing 
costs.  You can also obtain information on this program online at 
http://www.floridahousing.org/fthb/FirstTimeHomebuyers.aspx or by calling 
them at (850) 488-4197.

I hope this information is helpful, and if I can assist you with any other 
issue or concern, please let me know.

Holla señor governador es la segunda vez, que le escribo en la primera
ocacion yo pedi ayuda a usted, por que tenia que mudarme, usted respondio a
todas mis cartas y me ayudo intensamente gracias a DIOS no tuve que mudarme
ya que la dueña solo queria mas dinero pero yo la pude convencer para que me
dejara un año mas.
Pero yo queria comprar casa con la ayuda del programa de seccion 8, por que
yo tengo el plan pero no me apcetaron por que mi incotax era muy bajo, sabes
por que?
hace 8 años yo fuy victima de violencia domectica, yo deje el abusador y
vivi casi un año en los chelter sobrevivi  vendiendo comida en las calles,
pase mucho trabajo vote lagrimas de sangre por que yo no tenia mis papeles,
el que era mi esposo era solo recidente, dure 8 años com permiso de trabajo.
Y imigracion durante esos 8 años se dio el lujo de dejarme hasta 4 y 5 meses
sin permiso de trabajo. Antes de que se me vencieran yo aplicaba de nuevo
pero ellos me mandaban el nuevo cuando ellos querian asi, por tiempos me
quedaba sin trabajo ahora despues de 8 años recibi la recidencia permanente,
yo tengo 10 años en este pais.
tengo una niña de 8 años no tengo familia aqui. Yo soy venezolana  soy
huerfana de padres fui criada por una familia. Hasta los 14 años vivi en las
calles hasta los 22 años que vine aqui.
Despues de dejar el abusador con quien me case, yo misma pague el divorcio y
estudie y me supere como persona, crio sola a mi hija, no tengo vicios nunca
los he tenido ni cuando vivia en las calles.
hago mucho ejercio y como sano por que me gusta la vida sana.
Pero muchas veces me canso de ser un hombre, tengo que hacer el papel del
hombre y de la mujer en mi casa.
Yo no recibo ayuda economica del padre de mi hija ni de ningun tipo. Gano
semanal 300$ dollares trabajo de 8a.m a 5 p.m y para esto tengo que pagar
cuidado de la niña, seccion 8 no me quiere dar credito de esto por ejemplo
ahora en vacaciones yo tuve que pagar desde que comenzaron las vacaciones
hasta que comenzaron las classes 100$ semanal. para yo poder trabajar y la
seccion 8 yo llevando carta firmada de la persona que la cuidaba ellos no
quisieron darme credito por esto. Dos semanas antes me habia quedado sin
trabajo por que mi permiso de trabajo no llegaba.
Ahora la niña esta en un after school care pago aproximadamente 120$
mensual.
mas seguro de carro, letra del carro, no pago mucho de luz por que casi no
prendo los aires acondicionados. Paso mucho calor  por que no me alcansa
para pagar tanto, pago telefono comida ropa. Uniformes  y gasolina.
Lo que quiero dejarle saber con esto es lo siguiente:
Quiero saber si hay la posibilidad de yo recibir un medicare para mi, ya que
tengo un problema serio en mi boca. y no tengo como pagar un dentista yo ya
intente pedirlo a deparment and children y me exigen tener 5 años con
recidencia. Pero no es justo tengo 10 años viviendo aqui y todos los años
pago los impuesto. Yo no tengo la culpa que despues de ocho años imigracion
me halla dado la recidencia cuando yo deje el abusador violencia domestica
me pinto pajaritos en mi cabeza, para que yo no tubiera miedo pero no fue
haci nada de lo que me prometieron cumplieron yo me las aregle sola.
segundo.
No te olvides de nosotras las madres, que somos padre y madre a la vez y que
tenemos que soportar tratos de rechazo. Por nuestras condiciones de madres
solteras.  Tambien somos de carne y hueso y padecemos y lloramos por
nuestras lucha todos los dias.
Acuerdese de nosotras estamos vivas.
Gracias por prestar atencion a mi carta.
    Que DIOS  lo bendiga y le siga dando inteligencia y sabiduria para 
seguir
governando esta ciudad.
    Y tal vez el pais entero. " la fe es la garantia de lo que se espera, la
certeza de lo que no se ve.

Dear Your Honor,
 
Greetings to you, your family and your staff.  I trust that the beautiful Florida weather is continuing it's job of spreading sunshine into the souls of your subjects.
 
The purpose of my correspondence is to say that I may need to ask your assistance in a couple of days.  The situation at hand is a need by a family member to obtain a TN visa for a position he is offered through application on people first.  He entered the competition for this job while employed in Massachusetts with the Department of Child and Family Services.  He had been getting the TN visa concurrently for six years now.
 
Recently when he went for the renewal of his visa, the CBP officer told him that the letter facilitated by the State of Florida Department of Children and Families is inadequate.  He subsequently got a withdrawal for the application in order to facilitate compliance to the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  the CBP officer also noted two other things.  The job title states Child Protection Investigator and that terminology is not acceptable under NAFTA rules, however, Social Worker A/B is listed under NAFTA.  The realities are the same in that the field is social work, however, the CBP people informed me that the title name MUST match the NAFTA allowance.  This is where I really need your assistance.
 
I may need your assistance in supplying correspondence that would allow the Managers in Florida Department of Children and Families to change the classification name.
 
A matter that I am boggled by is the second thing noticed by the CBP worker.  He cited that my brother-in-law was working.  He is in pre-service training.  If he does not pass this training he is not employed.  Pre-service is a conditional requirement for employment. 


Thank you so very much.

Nov 11 was veterans day - 53 years ago I left Korea in Sep 54 - In June of 1962 I returned from a 30 month tour of duty in Germany
Nov 23 is Thanksgiving day
Nov 26 my wife and I will be married 49 years
We have 3 children, 6 grandchildren and 10 Greatgrand children
Dec 25th is Christmas.
 
I put the dates up to try to explain what you Family services has done to me by stop paying for my SS and taking two months of the charge out of my wife's check and two months out of mine. To do this in the month before Christmas is inhumane to say the least.
I have been a scoutmaster, little league coach, Sunday school teacher, youth leader and have participated in many youth events both with my children and with other children when I was stationed where my family could not be with me.
The VA says I am 100% disabled but I am only paid $115
per month. Our total income is normally $1030 from SS for my wife and I, and my VA pay, which mean we have $1145
per month normally. Now we will have to get by on approximately a total of $945 per month, after we get through the month of December on about $700.
Is there anything your office can do to help. 
If not can I get my case before the people so they can see what our politicians think of their Veterans

Dear Mr. Governor,
 
I am a student at Bergen Community College in Paramus, NJ. One of my classes is US Immigration from 1954-present. There is a major term paper due in 3 weeks and the assignment is to choose an area anywhere in the United States and explain the impact immigration has caused in that particular area. I previously studied at Lynn University in Boca Raton and while living in Florida I was always amazed of the great Hispanic- Latino influence in Florida.Mr.Governor you have done a great service to the state of Florida and to the Hispanic-Latino community. Is it possible to take 15 minutes out of your busy scheduale anytime in the next 3 weeks to interview you on the Hispanic-Latino influence in Florida. I am also hoping that Senator Martinez agrees to see me in Washington so I could interview him as well on his remarkble journey as a Cuban-American immigrant. Mr. Governor thank you so much.
 
Sincerely,
 
Brett Marcus

Hi, my name is John.  I am 19 years old and now live in Germany.  I used to 
live in Tampa, Florida for 12 years before my green card expired when I was 
still a minor, so I could not apply to renew it, and my mother wanted to go 
back to Germany.  She had divorced my step-father so I couldnt ask him to do 
it for me either.  Since I never wanted to leave Florida in the first place, 
I have been looking all over the place in how to get a new green card, 
without success so far.  I was wondering if there is anyway you could 
possibly help me out.  I have never been in trouble with the law or anything 
like that.  As well as I could immediatly have a job if I were to return 
since my brother still lives there and can get me work where he works.  If 
there is any way you can help me out Id appreciate it so much.  Thank you 
for your time.

Subject:	BEGGING FOR HELP!!!

Hi Govenor Bush,
 I know you must be really busy at this time.But I would like to forward you a summary of my immigration situation / case and hope that you might be able to refer it to someone who in turn might be able to help me, fingers crossed.!  Hopefully it won't bore you to death. So here goes.
        My full name is Matthew J Dyas, (Alien # 077-921-993 just in case you need it) I'm originally from Drogheda,Co-Louth,Ireland. I left my home and all I had there and came to the U.S. on June 6th 2000 due to threats made on my families lives and my own. These threats were to burn my mothers house down with them in it(of course)!!!, if I did'nt get out.So i decided to flee to the U.S. I was admitted through J.F.K airport on a 90 day vacation visa. I am  very much aware that I broke the law by outstaying my time. When I moved to florida the INS caught up with me and detained me. This is when I told them about my situation back home, I was then interviewed by a  senior Immigration official who heard my case and released me on the basis that he believed I had a credible fear of being returned to my country.
     I then retained attorney  Mark Labate who turned out to be a disaster, not only did he fail to get my asylum application in on time, but he also classified me as an arriving alien which caused a lot of problems later on.
   Next I retained attorney Julio A Padilla a referral from another attorney called Frederick A Polatzek.. We went on to file a lozato motion to allow us to file a late application. This was granted by Judge Seymour Kleinfeld (who has since retired but not before denying my application). My Asylum case was based on the facts that I was conned into fundraising for a number of "charitable organizations" one of them was called HEADWAY which is an organization to help people and their families who suffered  losses from head injuries. 
     This particular one was close to my heart as my younger brother Robert had not long passed due to a brain tumor. We also were fund raising for the Irish deaf society and others like the Irish arts and crafts foundation. Four or five vehicles would leave the agency based in  Drogheda every day and cross the border into Northern Ireland. Sometimes, certain individuals would be dropped off before crossing the border. This I found to be strange. On a number of occasions we were stopped by British patrols and questioned, shortly after I realized that the drivers were using radio to avoid  police checkpoints. Then came the day when I was arrested and interrogated by the R.U.C.(formerly The Royal Ulster Constabulary) When the R.U.C. were satisfied that I had no idea what I was involved in, they informed me that these people were in fact using this as a cover up to fund an illegal organization and I was in serious danger of being falsely imprisoned. I was furious. The following day I went to the head of the agency and told him what had happened to me and that I was going to contact the Irish Independant Newspaper to try and expose the whole operation.
 This was all happening in 1998 before the good friday aggreement. From that day on , the threats began.They went from an isolated verbal incident to a number of brutal attacks on me. All of which were reported to the police by my family and I. Then came the threats toward my family which scared the hell out of me. I never did expose them for fear of my life but i did name a few names at my Immigration Master Hearing. "One of those people I named at my hearing has just recently been caught with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of drugs, the same amount in cash and a small arsenal of automatic weapons, October 2006 (Paul Reay) ".MY CASE WAS DENIED. We then filed an appeal and soon after I got married to an american citizen.  About a year or so  later MY APPEAL WAS DENIED. Since we had already filed for an i130, we then filed for a greencard on the basis of marriage. That,s when my first attorney's screw up came into play and because he classified me as an arriving alien and I was considered not eligible to adjust my status. Finally we got all that taken care of and everything was looking great and it was just a matter of time untill I got my greencard.
  I have been married over two and a half years now and the i130 has not even been approved yet! and guess what , my marriage seems to be coming to an end soon.
                                                        So, to try and sum it all up: I have been here six and a half years. 'Right now'!!! I'm married to an American citizen. For all this time I have had a valid drivers license,(never got a ticket), valid work authorization, valid social security#, health and dental insurance for myself and my wife.I have never claimed a cent from any governmental agency or charity!!!!.  I schooled myself  for certifications with the American Indoor Air Quality Council, I hold the professional titles of a Council Certified Indoor Environmentalist, a Council  Certified Microbial Remediator, I am also certified with the IICRC in Fire and Smoke Restoration.I manage a restoration department with a nationwide franchise called Coit services. I have been a law abiding, tax paying member of church and community and I believe I provide a vital service to the residents of south Florida. I have also obtained my high school diploma (again), just so I could go to college here, to learn spanish. This year I became a published poet. my work was published in a hard back book called Twilight Musings. It was dedicated to september 11th and I sent a copy to the First Lady and President as a gift (I really hope they get to see it someday). I was published again just recently by Noble House Publishing Inc.located in the Empire State Building. Recently I've been in contact with Navy and Army recruiters as I am willing to serve and die for this country MY HOME that I love. All I would like in return is a chance to earn the privilege to become a legal resident and eventually a proud American citizen. 
       I thought with all my heart I would win my asylum case. After the master hearing the prosecuting attorney said outside "it's nothing to do with your predicament, it' all about politics!!!!!!!!  They said if the judge had granted asylum they would not have opposed his decision. 
                                      Govenor, I am running out of  faith, money$$$$!!!!!!and nerves I have spent thousands( at least $35,000) on this procedure over the years and to be honest sometimes I feel like I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown..Sorry to sound so dramatic but it's been a long hard struggle and the words of swift justice play in my mind a lot. I 'm trying my very best to make things right for 6 years now. I am five and a half years sober and proud of it, but I was hoping life would be a little easier for me now, although I do know it could be a lot worse! and I am a thankful person.
           I have tried to seek help in a number of ways. The Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform informed me that they can only help the "undocumented" and not someone like myself  who is trying to do everthing the proper way!!!! this to me seems unbelievable.           
             My next master hearing is Nov 29th. I AM CONFUSED AS TO WHAT MY ATTORNEY'S TACTICS ARE NOW. I'm beginning to think he is milking me for everything he can get, I hope I'm wrong . Now I think I'm babbling on, so I will sign off by saying, I HOPE AND PRAY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME. I will leave you my contact #s  cell 954 802 5978 office 954 486 0900 ext 242. My home address is 5448 NE 2nd AVE , Oakland Park , FL 33334.  Govenor Bush, thank you, just for taking the time to read this.
                                                          
                                                     Your's sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush,

It pleased me greatly to see that you awarded a World War I Victory
Medal to Ernest Pusey today.  And as much as it pleased me, it also
saddened me to learn in the article on foxnews.com that we have fewer
than 25 veterans of the first World War still living, according to VA
records.  I firmly believe that these valient men (and women) deserve
recognition on our National Mall, as the veterans of more recent
conflicts have been recognized, and I believe it should be done now -
while someone still remembers.  

While we still have living links to the Great War, we need to build a
memorial on the National Mall to honor their courage and sacrifice.  

Will you help me in this?  

Thank you,
Sincerely,
-Sal Robertson

I am a Disabled Veteran of Korea and the Cuban Crisis, because I was unable to work part of the time I quit teaching in 1999, prior to that I had worked as a Mechanic until I could not get in under the cars.
Besides my limited mobility, my wife has macular degeneration and is about blind.
The State agency that was paying our SS premium for my wife and I, tells me that now it will come out of our limited monthly income.
I guess if I were hispanic things would be different, they can come here never serve in the military, never pay taxes, drive without a license, send what they make back to Mexico and stick the American tax payer with the cost of benefits that citizens cant get.
Can you help or is it better if we just quietly starve to death and do without my wife's medicine, mine the VA sends me.
I am a Republican that is very disapointed in my party.

Dear Mr. Governor: I am a physician in Coral Springs, FL.  I serve as an expert to the Fl Dept of Health.   I am appealing to you for assistance.  I recently moved my practice to a new location in Coral Springs.   I properly submitted a forwarding address to the originating Post Office in a timely fashion.  I have not received my mail since October 1.   I have pled with the post office to remedy this but I do not get satisfactory responses, typically I get no response.   Today, they told me that my data was never entered into the system and as a result my mail was forwarded to a Forwarding Distribution Center in Pembroke Pines and that it will take 2 weeks till I can start receiving mail.   My practice does not have the resources to withstand not receiving revenue for this amount of time.   Could you please direct me to an authority that may be able to remedy this situation?

I am hoping you can take time out of your very busy schedule and assist us. I, Maxine Spalding, filed for adjustment of status for our mom. However, due to several unfortunate circumstances, the process has been drawn out. The latest situation is that it has been over six months and we still have not been contacted by the Miami office for an interview after initially being handled in CA. We have been to the Miami Info Center twice to no avail. Governor Bush, could you please assist us? The receipt # from USCIS is WAC0506751557.

Dear Governor Bush:
I filed for Social Security Disability on April 14, 2005.  I was denied so I turned it over to an Attorney .  I was denied a second time and then a hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2006.  The hearing was cancelled due to the Attorney being sick, which I can understand, being a Doctors daughter.

On August 7 (I was in the hospital at this time) I spoke with my Attorney and he said the Judge should be back in Panama City in October. Well, October has come and gone .  The word I have now is that the Judge has my file on his desk (since the middle of Oct.) and could either make a decision without a hearing or could schedule a hearing at any time.

I haven"t worked or been able to work since November 2004 and am financially strapped . I feel as if I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.

If there is anything you can do or know of anyone I can talk to about getting this settled I would greatly appreciate it.

Subject:	Federal Parole

I am still waiting for someone to respond to my emails on Federal Parole.  I am concern tax payer and I keep watching state prisoner out in parole and Federal prisoner without parole.  State prisoner are rapist, child molesters, and etc., usually state prisoners are violent crimes.  Compare to federal prisoner they are mostly white collar criminals.  And as a tax payer we spend about $40,000.00 a year on one inmate I don’t even make that much a year.  I thought as Floridian’s we are attempting to lower our cost and I think its time to pass the bill on H.R.3072 - Federal Parole Bill.   Read what the American Correction has to say:

 

21 August 2006  - Immediate Release

 

H.R. 3072 - A Bill to Revive the System of Parole for Federal Prisoners

A resolution supporting federal legislation for the "Reinstatement of a System of Parole for Federal Prisoners" was unanimously passed by the American Correctional Association Delegate Assembly on Wednesday, 16 August 2006, in Charlotte, North Carolina.  

 

 

To wit:

 

WHEREAS, a substantial number of Federal inmates are nonviolent drug offenders with long sentences and the majority of this segment of the inmate population is being incarcerated for the first time; and

 

WHEREAS, some Federal inmates are serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for nonviolent offenses; and

 

WHEREAS, parole has been eliminated in the Federal system; and

 

WHEREAS, offenders can be rehabilitated and should be given a second chance to lead productive lives; and

 

WHEREAS, prison crowding is a danger to both inmates and staff; and

 

WHEREAS, the cost to house inmates increases substantially with age; and

 

WHEREAS, a Federal agency with inmate release jurisdiction exists to protect public safety;

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the American Correctional Association urges Congress to reinstate and fully fund a system of parole for Federal prisoners.

Dear Sir,

 

Is there any way to vote against the time change? When we lose daylight savings in winter, I get home from work at 6pm and it's already dark. I have a small child and work full time. I have no outside time with my son. Our society is getting more and more obese due to lack of activity. Couldn’t we at least try to do something to help this? I know the time change was originally so that business could spend less money on electric for lighting; it seems they have it backwards, we loose an hour and it gets darker earlier??? How is this saving electric?
Your response to this question is appreciated.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,


My name is Sapna Patel, I currently live in Orlando, Florida. I'm writing this e-mail out of great respect for who you are and the work you do. I've been in Florida for 2 years and really respect the way you conduct your job to benefit Florida's residents. Thank you. I am a legal alien who is on my H1-B work permit, I was born In Zambia, Central Africa and moved to the United States in 1994 on an F1 Student visa and have since then been on various visa status. I am in my last process of receiving my greencard, but have been told that my turn will come in another 3-4 years. I have been working for the Florida Municipal Power Agency for a year and a half. Unfortunately I have been taken for granted for the sole reason that I can not leave due to my Green Card approval status and thus have been working 60 hour weeks. I am pleading with you if you can help me out regarding this matter. I have my USICS case number for your review also. I have 2 other sisters who are both in the same situation as I. I am an accountant, my sister is a Physicial Assistant and another a Computer Scientist. All three of us work in some way for the State. My sister for the Florida Hospital and the other for backing up the software for non for profit organizations. I wanted to know if you could help us in the green card situation. After 12 years in The United States I have great repect for the country. I couldn't imagine calling any other place home, but have battled this lack of freedom for 12 years. My I-I40 case number is SRC0619851477.

Thanks and best regards

Thank you for a job well done for Florida!  We will benefit from your efforts far into the future.

 

Now, may I respectfully ask a favor?  I would very much like to offer a few comments to your brother, our President without dilution by his email auditing staff.

 

First, I think yesterdays tragic losses in the U.S. house and senate were not really his fault.  I lay the major blame on the incumbents who declined or did not know how to use majority power while they held it.  Had they done so and more effectively implemented the President’s programs and judicial nominations, I think yesterday’s results would have been far different.

 

However I do fault the President on one count which can still be addressed with beneficial results for the Party.   His invasion of Iraq was proper and can not fairly be criticized by anyone fully familiar with the information available at the time.  If anything, the invasion was years overdue.  However his conduct of the war has been far too compassionate.  It is not the normal purpose of war to leave your enemy in better condition than you found him and to do so does not deter him or copycats from being a continuing threat.  The purpose of war is to defeat/destroy the enemy and leave them unable to launch a repeat performance.  In the case of Iraq this can be accomplished by taking their oil and using this asset to cover our costs and drastically lower our taxes.  Following this path would quickly negate need to maintain troops in a helpless country too bankrupt to rearm.  I sincerely believe this path would be applauded by all but the most liberal Americans and would be heavily rewarded in the next election.  More importantly today, the plan could be implemented by use of Presidential power as Commander in Chief.

Jeb,

I am a supporter of the war in Iraq and I understand why things are being 
done and why we cannot leave cold turkey. I have been contemplating for a 
long time on what direction I should take in my life.  I have recently 
decided that the Air Force is the direction that I should steer my life 
to. After speaking with a recruiter today, she informed me that there is 
no room for officers at this time and that I would have to enlist first. I 
am writing you today to ask if there is any way possible in which I can be 
entered into the Air Force officer program. Anything that you can do for 
me would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to Charlie Crist 
carrying on all of the good things that you have started.


Sincerely,

I am writing to strongly communicate the need to delay the new Medicare Power Mobility Fee Schedule published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) scheduled for an November 15, 2006 implementation.  

As published, these drastic price reductions will limit and deny access to medically appropriate power mobility products and services for Medicare beneficiaries, especially those beneficiaries with severe disabilities.  This will not only hurt Medicare beneficiaries, but also children and other adults with complex disabilities that require this equipment to meet their daily medical and functional needs.

For almost three years now CMS, physicians, clinicians, consumers, providers, and manufacturers have worked on improvements and safeguards to the Medicare power mobility benefit.  However, given the drastic cuts in the reimbursement amounts it appears that all this time and effort may be undermined by a rush to implement changes before key issues are resolved and an appropriate implementation period is provided.  Moving forward without making the required corrections and allowing an appropriate time period for implementation will create major access problems for Medicare beneficiaries and others.  

The new fee schedule drastically reduces reimbursement for complex rehab products used by severely disabled consumers by up to 33% or more.  These products are used by beneficiaries with severe diagnoses such as ALS, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury and severe brain injury.  These reductions will eliminate the availability of the appropriate power wheelchair and service required by Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals with complex disabilities. 

In developing the new fee schedule, CMS utilized a pricing methodology that has been universally recognized as flawed.  In fact, CMS itself has admitted the methodology does not work and is in the process of putting a new methodology in place.  As an example of the problems, the fee schedule provides that a Group 2 power wheelchair (less complex) will be reimbursed at a higher rate than a Group 3 power wheelchair (more complex).  

These changes are the most dramatic since the establishment of the power mobility benefit under Medicare: 64 new codes, new pricing, new coverage criteria, and new documentation requirements.  How can these possibly be implemented effectively and smoothly with such a short period of time for physician and clinician education and the major operational and educational changes required within each Medicare provider’s operation?

Given the significant concerns being expressed by all stakeholders- physicians, clinicians, consumers, providers, and manufacturers- I respectfully but strongly request that the November 15, 2006 effective date for the published pricing and coverage policies be postponed until all identified issues are resolved.  Once these issues are resolved, the revised information can then be published and a 120 day implementation period provided to allow for a smooth transition.

To rush ahead without fixing the issues and problems that have been identified will undermine all the time and effort of the past three years and hurt the ability of Medicare beneficiaries and others with disabilities to access medically appropriate mobility equipment.

My name is Manyvone Champavannarath, but everyone calls me Many or Speedy.  Different people have different names for me. Most people call me a giggle box because I love to laugh. I was born 32 years ago with severe cerebral palsy (CP). I grew up in Central Florida, where my family settled after leaving Laos.
 
I graduated from high school with high honors in 1994. I loved high school. After high school I went straight to college where I graduated with my Associate’s Degree in Business Administration in 1999.  
 
In 1997, I moved into my own apartment with a roommate to help with the bills.  I have caretakers who come in and out to do things for me. I moved out because I wanted to be independent and I wanted to do things like go hang out with my friends. I wanted to be like a normal 23 year old girl. This was one of the best things I have done.
 
In 1998, I became involved with the church near my house.  I am doing more with my church now.  During the week I run errands around the church. I working with youth group every Sunday night.  I help teach Sunday School Class every Sunday morning. I help out with middle schoolers one Friday a month.  
 
I tutor a second grader at an after school program once a week at church. I am on the Administrative Board at church that meets every quarter. I am on the Youth Council that meet once a month. I am on the Welcome Committee at church. I go visit people at the nursing home for the church when I have time. 

I don’t think lawmakers realized how much the disable have to depend on power wheelchairs.   This is due to the fact that they have no clue what it’s like to be in a wheelchair for 16 hours a day for the rest of their life.  

My wheelchair is the most essential part of my life.  It gives me independence and the best quality of life.  If the new guidelines go through, I will be a prisoner in my own home!! This new guidelines will take my legs away!!!!

I’m begging you not to make us disabled suffer anymore than we already are!!!!

November 8, 2006

 

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am writing you out of concern for my friend and co-worker Ovil Hernandez.  Ovil has been detained at Krome Detention in Miami since last Thursday, November 2nd.  His bond was recalled and he was detained on November 2, 2006.  I know the reason of his case which is pending, and has been for a while now.  I am writing you to request you review his case/file and try to get him released on bond.  He has a wife and family here in Boca Raton of which I also know well and am fondly of.

His wife is eight months pregnant with their second expectant child.  There daughter Izabella just turned two years old.  I have known his wife for 20 years as we became friends working in West Babylon, NY and re-located to Florida in the early 90’s.  She is also a genuinely good person and friend whom I am deeply concerned about right now.  

 

I would like to take this opportunity to speak of Ovil on a personal and professional note.  I have known Ovil and worked with him for 10 years.  I have been employed with Volvo Aero for twenty years now.  In my career path with Volvo I was a Purchasing manager and Warehouse Operations Manager.  Ovil worked for me for the period of 1998-2001 in our Bulk, Surplus Lot Receiving area.  He proved to be an extremely hard worker and was made Lead Man in this area.  He assisted me with implementing an automated receiving program and took ownership of the system and the receiving area.   As a result I transferred him into Purchasing when I transitioned back to managing this area in 2002 as I knew he was proud of his accomplishments, dedicated, loyal, and a good leader.   Ovil sets a good example in his personal and professional life.  In his personal life he is family orientated, shows his faith in god, friendship and love.   He has struggled with this case hanging over his life for 11 years and is remorseful.  I believe he has suffered enough and as his former manager, believe me, I have seen his suffering.  This affected his spirit and ability to stay positive for quite a few years.  He just wants this behind him and a chance to be the person, husband and father he wants to be.

 

In summary I would appreciate any assistance or feedback you can provide regarding this case and his request to be released on bond.   Ovil is kind and helpful and sincerely a good person.  He has qualities I respect and admire.  

 

Thank you in advance for your attention in this matter.

 

Best Regards,

Dear Governor, 
    
Congratulations!!  I was inspired to write you after hearing your acceptance speech. Thanks to our positions as postal workers, we, my fiancee and I, are among those Floridians who moved here to enjoy all that Florida has to offer. We have fallen in love with Florida, our happy new home. Unfortunately, if the Postal Service has its way, we will have no other choice but to leave our beautiful Sunshine State. 
 
The Postal Service has chosen our facility, the Tampa remote encoding center, for closing on March 2nd, 2007. Four hundred and fifty transitional employees, of which I am one, will be jobless. We are now debating wether to leave Florida and follow the job to a similar facility in Tennessee. No one seems to be able to convince the Postal Service otherwise. We have been operating for over ten years and were the premier test site of the original fifty five centers, forty five of which have met our apparent misfortune. We process mail for most of the state of Florida, as well as other major cities in the Southeast. We are competent and very skilled workers that give our employer 110 percent. 
 
Is there any way that you can convince the USPS to refrain from closing us down. Our union president has met with several of our local representatives; however, their efforts have fallen on deaf ears and doesn't seem to have generated much interest. I am hoping that your office or a higher authority can post an inquiry admonishing the Postal Service of its grave mistake and ask them to explain its reasoning and to justify the loss of so many jobs and the loss of millions of dollars into the local Tampa economy. 
 
We don't want to leave Florida. Anything your office can do would be greatly and deeply appreciated. Good luck to you both.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Govenor Jeb Bush:
 
       I am writing to you concerning the Social Security Court Hearings.  I was disabled in a horrible car accident on December 1, 2003.  I have been trying to get Social Security Disability since that time. 
 
      I am disabled to the point of never leaving my home except for doctor appointments and once a month grocery shopping.   I am in horrible pain daily, even with medication.  I have been turned down the customary 2 times for Social Security.  After that I filed for my Social Security Hearing on July 31, 2005.  I have been waiting for my file to be called up for hearing since that time.  
 
      I cannot work, anything causes  me pain, especially standing and walking.  I have settled my case with the driver of the car that caused the accident, which of course went to pay medical bills and attorneys fees.  I am in  a desperate state.  Since I settled my case, my doctor will only see me if I can pay first, which I can't because I have no way of making money.  If I could get my Social Security Disability then I would have insurance which would cover my doctor visits. Please help me to get my case up for hearing. My home is paid off, but my lot rent is due every month along with other monthly bills.  I don't know what to do.  I can't understand why it takes so long just to get a hearing.  Can you please help me?  I don't know where else to turn.  I just need to get my hearing so I can get my disability and then I'll be able to pay my bills and have coverage for my doctor appointments which I go to once a month.  I also have several medications that I'm taking that I have to pay for.  I don't have anyone to help me.  
 
     My mother moved here from Nevada after the accident so she could take care of me, but she is also disabled and she has had to go and get a part time job just to pay for my prescriptions and the monthly bills.  She has been fired from 2 jobs because she is very slow due to her disability, and she gets confused easily.  We do get food stamps which I'm very thankful for, otherwise I don't  think we would have much to eat.  I would 
much rather just get my disability so I wouldn't have to get food stamps. 
 
      It is a very humbling experience I've had.  I took so much for granted, walking, driving, doing anything I wanted to do.  I had always been very active.  I have ridden and trained horses my whole life.  I was also a certified riding instructor for the disabled and able people.  I liked to go out with my friends.  I had a very good relationship with a man who had asked me to marry him.  After the accident he decided he would rather have someone who would be able to do the things that I couldn't.  I now have to depend on others to push me around.  I don't even have a motorized wheelchair, which makes it very hard on my mother.  She has to put the wheelchair in and out of the car and then push me around.  It is a very humbling experience that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
 
     I've gotten off track.  Please help me get my hearing moved up so that I can at least not have to worry about paying for my doctor visits and my medication.  My mother cannot go out and get another job, she's not in any shape to be doing that.  It's hard enough on her that she has to take care of me.  It's supposed to be the other way around.  I'm not one who likes to ask for help, but I really need it and I don't know where to turn.  Please help us.  Thank you for taking the time to read my email.  God Bless You.

November 6, 2006 

Honorable Governor Bush: 

I am writing this letter on behalf of my husband, Ovil Osmark Hernandez Cruz to respectfully ask for your help.  I am a citizen of the United States and was born in 1970 in Rockville Center, NY.  

Ovil has been detained without cause by INS in the Krome Immigration Services Detention Center in Miami after appearing for a hearing on Thursday, November 3, 2006 after many years of fighting to stay in this country.  He is not a flight risk and has shown up for every hearing that he has been scheduled to appear at.  We are a family of 4 at the moment, but are expecting our 3rd child which is due in the next few weeks.  I cannot make it through the end of this pregnancy or the rest of my life without Ovil with me.  If INS is allowed to keep him I don’t know how I will make it through the delivery of our expected child.  If they are allowed to deport him we will loose everything we have fought so hard to build for our family, our home and his job.  The stress we are all under during this period is of course very high.  My children seem to be suffering the worst from this.  Our 8 year old is a little easier to explain this to, but our 2 year old really doesn’t understand and only cries for her Papa when she doesn’t find him during the day.

He is currently employed with Volvo Aero Services here in Boca Raton, FL and has held this job steadily for at least the last 9 years.  He has been awarded promotions within the company and even was given the award of Employee of the Month in October of 2004.

Ovil’s situation is one that is very disheartening.  He not only has a blemish on his record, but is also fighting INS not to deport him back to Guatemala.  Ovil is not yet a citizen of the United States, but a Permanent Resident seeking United States Citizenship.  His Mother, Father and Sister have all become United States Citizens, yet he is still fighting for this freedom.  They came to the United States in the early 1980’s because of the violence in their former country of Guatemala.

We have submitted a request for Pardon on August 11, 2006 to the Office of Executive Clemency regarding Ovil's case which we hope will get reviewed and approved with the circumstances surrounding the case.

Over ten years ago Ovil was charged with lewd assault on a minor.  The circumstances surrounding the case were quite simple.  Ovil met a girl and one thing lead to another and they spent the night together.  The girl ended up to be less than 18 years old and her parents pushed to press charges against Ovil in denial that their daughter was having consensual sexual relations at a young age.  Once the parents realized that their daughter was not telling the truth regarding the story they decided to drop the charges, but it was too late.  The State decided to press the charges because of the type of case it was.  He pled no contest to the charges.  Ovil was sentenced to 5 years probation, which he served and was released without any trouble.  During those 5 years though he was arrested and taken to Manatee County because INS wants to deport him.  He now lives the life of a Sexual Offender in the shadows of people that might think the worst of him if they were to find out without knowing the circumstances surrounding the case.

We understand the severity of the conviction against Ovil, but don’t understand how a country that protects its people could allow something so horrible to leave a black mark on the life of one young person who made one very big mistake.  Should a person that has made one mistake pay with his entire life?  Ovil is not a Sexual Offender in the true sense of the description.  Yet he must follow the guidelines set for people who knowingly cause harm to others when he poses no threat to society.  He must register twice a year so that the State of Florida knows where he lives at all times.  Police Officers show up at home to make sure he’s still living there.  He cannot go on field trips with his daughters because school volunteers must pass a background check.  Even though there has never been, either before the conviction or after, any other accusation, the label of Sexual Offender follows Ovil with all of its harshness. 

For the first 2 ½ years of our marriage Ovil suffered from Anxiety and Panic Attacks which he received medical treatment for.  He has since gotten himself off all of the medication he was taking, but still suffers with Anxiety on a daily basis.  The Panic Attacks have subsided, thank God, but there are no guarantees that they will never return.  The attacks were brought on by the stress related to all of this hanging over Ovil’s head.  He thinks everyday what life will be like if INS deports him.  He thinks about where he’ll live, if he’ll even make it, if he’ll be able to get a job, if he’ll ever see his family again and if he’ll ever be able to hold us in his arms feeling the security that a wife and children can bring to your life.  It is not only scary for him, but for all of us too.  Ovil is the backbone of our household.  I do not know how we will survive if he is not here with us.  He helps his parents and sister, niece and nephew not only by being there for them in times of need, but monetarily as well.

I will not write this letter and tell you that Ovil has never done anything in his life wrong, but I will tell you that in the 7 years that I know him he has done nothing unlawful.  He has the utmost respect for me and our children.  One of which is my daughter from a previous marriage and the other is our daughter together.  Our family will not be complete if Ovil is deported.  Our children will loose their father and I will loose my husband & best friend.  He is a hard working, faithful and honest person, the kind of person America would be proud to call a Citizen.

Please Governor Bush, review this matter and help my husband in any way you can. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

 Dear Governor,
 
I am a devout Republican and I am somewhat dismayed that I am having a problem getting Medicare to take action to recoup funds that were illegally billed in the years 2004 and 2005. I thought that Republicans were taking a staunch position on Medicare fruad and abuse. Maybe because it doesn't involve millions of dollars, they really don't care (this reminds me of personal injury attorneys). I have been practicing medicine for 14 years- all in the state of Florida. I found myself in the unfortunate position of practicing with a Pathologist who overcoded, inflated bills by doing unnecessary testing,etc. I fired him in October 2003. He went to Broward county to work with Broward Medical Laboratories. He worked out of his house in Sanford and billed Medicare location 3/4 instead of 1/2 for 2 years (the owner of Broward Medical Labs was involved in this overbilling). I related this to Medicare in the beginning of 2006 or late 2005. I  became aware of this during discovery while defending myself against his wrongful termination suit. Absolutely no action has been taken. Why is this? Do you think this sends the right message to other physicians billing Medicare? It is absolutely demoralizing to watch physicians like this get away with it. It is hurting those of us who practice medicine responsibly and continue to suffer Medicare cuts year after year. Please do what you can to stop these greedy physicians who hurt patients, the Medicare system, and their colleagues by overbilling for services.

Dear Governor Bush,
Over two months ago I flew to England to visit some friends for the first time. Once I got there, I was refused entry by an immigration officer because of some ridiculous, made up reason of which today, I still do not understand. (Something that had to do with my savings account and also questioning where I will be living on my return home.) I have always been a loyal US citizen; never have been in any type of trouble in my life, not even getting any type of parking ticket. Once I was returned home, I immediately was informed to contact our senators office for help, which I did. Mel Martinez' staff told me to apply for a visitors visa, which I did and I also forwarded all parties involved copies of all immigration letters and telling them of how I was mistreated and lied to. The office, specifically Melissa, told me that she could help me. I even received a letter from Senator Marinez saying that his office looked forward to helping me resolve my problem. 
Unfortunately, I was denied the visitors visa but this time for totally different reasons that were even more ridiculous than the first reasons. 
I never heard from Mel Martinez' office for a long time after that even though I called and called so I finally went to the office with my husband. Once I got there, my contact, Melissa, would not come out to see my husband and I but another woman came out to see us. She informed us that Mel Martinez' office did not take care of these types of issues. I was devastated! I wasted two months and couldn't understand why Melissa didn't tell me that from the beginning. She was in contact with me a lot and kept telling me that she would help and that she would make phone calls and take care of things for me. I just don't understand why it took so long to finally tell me that this office was the wrong place to be. There were many sources I checked ahead of time and they all pointed me towards the US Senators office. Am I just getting the brush off? 
I feel helpless and I would like to take my earned vacation to visit my friends. I have enough money and I see no reason why I should not be able to visit a country that I want to. I am no threat to anyone. I am an upstanding person with good morals and values and have always abided by rules and regulations, never causing any problems wherever I go.
Is there anyway possible your office can help me if I provide all the details and documentation or is it possible to find someone who can help me? I am desperate. I thought that this is the governments job to help its citizens in times of need. I am all alone trying to fight a silly battle that shouldn't have even started to begin with. If I have to, I will write to the president because I pay my taxes and I need help! I have no where else to turn.
Please help me!
Thank you in advance.

My goal in writing to you is to see if you can help my husband a US residence, born in Turkey, to get his Q Clearance in order for him to work in his profession. He studied in Missouri his Masters and PHD in Nuclear Engineer. Since we got here as a US residents he got several of jobs offers, some of them referring to his resume as a "Perfect Match". But unfortunately when the question was asked about his Clearance, he always said " I do not have one, but I won' t have any problem in getting one if that is what you request". Unfortunately, Q Clearance are only for US Citizens. My question is, Why not now?? Why to wait until he gets his US Citizenship? I guess in these days US will be safer is not only US Citizens are getting their Clearance but if US residences are getting theirs, too. 

 

We are willing to do what ever we need to do in order to get a Clearance, we do not have any problem. My husband just wants to work in what he spent all his life studying for. Please, let me know how to do that, or where to go? I hope you can help us here.  

 

Hope to hear from you soon, Mr. Governor.

 

Best Regards,

Patricia Ubaldo Guvendik

Melbourne, FL

Dear Gov. Bush, My name is Debbie Jewett My Husband is Bradley Recently he applied for a passport and was denied because of an incorrect arreage amount reported by the stat of Indiana. In October of 2005 we went into the office of child support in Geen Cove Springs Florida and presented them with my husbands final divorce decree which stated the my stepson was emancipated as an adult(10-07-2005) He reached the age of 18.The state of Florida said that they took care of this problem,well they didn't.therefore the state of Indiana reported the arreages in excess of $6000. We have a print out from the state of Florida which depicts an amount of $2192.13 Which we faithfully pay on time each and every month.It is garnished from my husbands paycheck.My problem is the letter we received from the passport office states that it will take 2 to 3 weeks to have his name removed from the list.We cant wait that long,Bradley is scheduled to be in Camp Lejune NC on Monday Nov.13 and from there he is supposed to be in Iraq on Nov.16. Is there anything that you can do to expedite this matter?The office of child support in GCS are at fault in this matter and they seem to be rather incompetent.Bradleys' child support case # is 03-0000788-DR SS# [REDACTED]     1362 Nolan Rd Middleburg,Florida32068        904-282-3696      He really needs to have this matter resolved before Mon. Nov 13 so that he can serve his counrty and support his family Sincerly Debbie Jewett

Dear Governor Bush,

I urge you to take immediate action to stop the devastating changes to the Medicare Power Mobility Device (PMD) benefit scheduled to take effect on November 15. The planned changes will severely restrict access to the power wheelchairs many people with disabilities need to live independent lives and participate fully in society.

In August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final local coverage determination (LCD) for power mobility devices which places strict limits on access to “Group 3” power wheelchairs, the type of wheelchairs often needed by those with long term disabilities and chronic conditions.

CMS has also issued new reimbursement levels for these Group 3 wheelchairs which will cut reimbursements by up to 40 percent. These cuts will likely translate into serious access problems for beneficiaries as many providers say they will be unable to provide these high-end devices to Medicare beneficiaries at the new reimbursement levels.

Both of these changes are scheduled to take effect on November 15, 2006.  Access to appropriate mobility devices is essential to allowing persons with mobility impairments to live independently, to work, and to participate in community life. I am always out in the community doing things. My wheelchair gives me independence and the BEST quality of life.  Without my wheelchair I would be a prisoner in my own home!!!!!!

Thanks,
Manyvone Champavannarath

Dear Sir,
My name is James Nickerson, I am a 21 year old merchant mariner and CIVMAR with the Department of Defense. 
 
Recently, a friend of mine lost her father. He was a merchant mariner who served on ships that crossed the Atlantic during World War II, during the Battle of the Atlantic. He recently passed away from natural causes at an old age. 
 
I recently was given the National Ensign on a ship that I served on. 
 
I was wondering if it would be possible if I could get a letter signed by your brotherm President Bush and Vice President Cheney. Authorizing me to present the flag to her on behalf of The President and Vice President of United States, for "her father's long and dedicated service to his country." 
I believe that our Merchant Mariners who served during World War II, have earned that honor.
 
Respectfully,
James Nickerson

Gov. Bush,

I apologize for bothering your office but I am at my wits end!  I am a resident alient from U.K. having been in this country for 30 years+.  I didn't realise that my Green card had expired until today when I tried to renew my driver's license online.  I was advised I had to appear in person along with my Alien Card.  No problem I thought.  After 5 hours on the internet trying to locate an INS office (and spending $249 to an organization called United States Immigration) I discovered I am only going to receive a book giving instructions on how to apply!  So much for all that money.

I did reach the USICS via internet but was unable to download the form I90 which apparently I need.  I then called their 800 no. and was advised that I didn't really need to renew my green card due to the length of time I had been here and the fact that:

1:  I have been married to an American citizen for 22+ years, he is also a Vietnam vet.

2:  I have a son who's citizenship application is in process with about another year to go.

3:  I have two grandchildren born here in Florida.

They will send me the form I90 (which will cost $270) in the mail and will send me a receipt, when I return it, within 30 days.

Here's my problem:  I need to renew my driver's license before 11/09 and although I have an appointment with my local DMV, they are advising there will be a problem!!  How do I do this?

I am a property owner, have worked in this country for 30 years and would love to be a citizen but cannot afford the fees they charge (am on Soc. Sec.).  Am I to be victimized because of a lack of money?  I need someone to contact me to advise what else can be done.  I have given this country a lot of money in the form of all relevant taxes, the only thing I have been unable to do is vote and, quite honestly, with the enormous smear campaigns going on, it would be difficult to make a choice right now.  However, since I'm not going to be given the option right now, I probably don't need to worry about this.

Can you provide some solution, suggestions etc.?  Any help would be appreciated.

Many thanks.

Patricia Conner

Dear Governer Bush,
                            My name is Ray Perez, I am a 
(TSO)-Transportation Security Officer for the Dept. of Homeland Security at 
(MCO)-Orlando International Airport. The reason for me e-mailing you is, 
because I have no more answers for my case that I have 
against(TSA)-Transportation Security Administration I've been very patience 
about everything about this case from the U.S. Dept. of Labor in the Workers 
Compensation Dept. First I want to apologize for bothering you with this 
situation I'm having, you have other things that are more important than 
mine, but I really do not know who to go to w/ this issue any more. I'm 
getting the run around from everybody from top to bottom in the U.S. Dept. 
of Labor about my case sir. It's been 6 months that I have not return to 
work. I married w/ three boys 18,16,11. My wife(Cassandra Perez) works for 
the Dept. of Children & Families, she is very supportive & the best 
Supervisor that your Government agency has right now, but in this case I 
have right now is draining the life out of me & my wife. Right now she is 
the bread winner of our home. It's very hard for me right now I can not do 
nothing, I can't work, walk sometimes outside, be around in public places.
                                      My doctor diagnosis me w/ a very 
serious disability, I get very serve migraine headaches & manic attacks it's 
like living in a prison in my own home. My health is in very serious risk 
right now, all I trying to do is to get my life back to normal once again w/ 
my wife & my boys. I'm seeing a excellent doctor that I been seeing for 3 
years & a therapist. For the last two months I can't afford my doctor's & my 
medicine, because my younger son that has almost the same disability I have 
is important to me, my child comes first before me w/ this disability. He 
has to go to school. The only thing I could do is deal w/ my disability 
alone by my self w/ no one home w/ out harming no one. I'm not asking to 
feel sorry for me w/ this disability I have to live with this for the rest 
of my life, but to help me get back in track w/ my life Governer Bush this 
issue is very hard for me & my family. My family is very supportive of this 
situation that's happening to me in my life, but my health is in real 
jeopardy.
                           I'm dealing w/ District 6 in Jacksonville, 
Florida, my claims examimer is Brenda Griffin of the Workers Comp. 
Department. I gave her all my documents from my doctor, she got all the 
documents from my employer's. I've spoken w/ her more than a few times about 
why is it taking so long, if you have everything in place to make a 
determination and I gave everything to you in August, she tells me she has 
other cases to look over, it might take another month for a determination. I 
spoke w/ a gentleman(Deric) in another department of technical support in 
the Dept. of Labor about my issue he tells me that their is nothing he can 
do to help me, the only thing he said is wait for the claims examiner or 
call her to see if she made her determintation. I replied to Deric that I 
call so many times, she calls me a week later when she suppose to contact 
some one three days later, and states to me she will make a determination 
the following week. Now it's been one week later after she stated to me. I 
just do not now what to do any more w/ this situation any more, will you 
please Governer Bush HELP ME!!! With this determination from the U.S. Dept. 
of Labor. to expedite my case, I think 6 full months of this nightmare is 
enough Governer.

                                                                             
             Thank You Governer J. Bush.

P.S. If any one from your office would like to talk to me or e-mail, my 
number is 407-701-7056- rayperez60@hotmail.com

Dear Mr. Bush;
My name is Donna Rudd. I am the daughter of an 84 year old woman.  I have spent the last two (2) hours on the telephone with the Social Security Administration (State and Local) trying to find out why she was dropped and how to reinstate my mother's medicare medical insurance premiums, without success!  She received the notice on 
Saturday, March ll, 2006 stating the State would no longer pay the premium of $88.50 monthly.  The insurance premium of $177.00 will be deducted from her April check leaving her $591.00 to live on for the month.   It would have been very nice had she been notified of this action so I could have prevented this from happening. 
Sir, I am requesting your help to have these premiums reinstated.  Mr. Bush I have never ask for help in anyway from any agency but she is in a very difficult situation and I feel in my heart this is so wrong.   Please help her so her April check will not be affected by this.

Subject:	We need your help!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to you on behalf of my former husband, Philip Fiorentino, who finds himself in a difficult situation at this time regarding health insurance and needs your help.
 
Just so you understand, we were married for nearly 25 years, have been divorced for 3 1/2 and remain very good friends, so we try to help each other out whenever we can.  Insurance is my field of expertise to some degree, therefore I am trying to help him. 
 
In an attempt to keep this brief, Phil is currently on disability income as a result of several dibilitating conditions.  He was first approved for this in January 2005 and received his first state disability payment in July 2005.  Since we are a relatively normal, my (former) husband and I always had good jobs with excellent health insurance so we never had any problems in that area until now. 
 
In a nutshell, there are some serious flaws to the Medicare laws that relate to disability recipients.  If this has come to MY attention, I am sure you are aware of it, but Phil needs a solution now so I am contacting you for help.
 
After he was unable to continue working, we COBRA'd his health insurance from work.  Well, his COBRA runs out December 9, 2006.  I called to register him for Medicare, (after all, he is on disability, right???) only to find out he is not eligible for 2 years AFTER he began receiving his SSI payments, (which is 2 1/2 years from his approval date!)  I am floored! Clearly, this makes no sense.  If someone is on disability, obviously, he can't work and there are significant pre-existing conditions. If there are pre-existing conditions, no one wants to insure you, and if they do, the coverage is limited and the premiums are "through the roof", especially considering he is on a fixed income.  I made calls to several private health insurance carriers and even IF they are willing to cover him, the premiums are unaffordable.
 
The Social Security Office suggested applying for Medicaid, but already told me that his income is to high for assistance.  That also is ironic because if he has to pay what I have been quoted for health insurance, then his income qualifies him as poverty level.
 
I guess my question to you is: How can someone on disability not qualify for Medicare and what can be done to get him insured right away?  I have left 2 messages at the Medicaid office, but have not yet received a call back.  I currently live in Central Florida, but have plans to go to South Florida this weekend to help Phil sort this out. I took the day off work Friday so we can go to the Medicaid office , if necessary, but since I haven't heard back from them, I am not sure if this is a wasted trip.
 
If you need more information from me as to Phil's condition, or specific research I have done, I will be happy to provide that to you.  All I know is he cannot be without health insurance and if Medicare or Medicaid are not available to him because of flaws in state & federal laws, he and others like him should not be the ones to suffer and we need to know what to do.
 
Please help.
 
By the way, I mean this sincerely...it has been a pleasure and honor having you as this State's Governor.  A greatly admire you and your entire family and look forward to seeing you in the White House in the near future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Linda Fiorentino

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

Sir,
I returned from a 4-day vacation to Costa Rica on Oct. 29th, and 
experienced a very disturbing incident with the dept. of Homeland 
Security / U.S. Customs at Miami airport. I may be consulting a lawyer 
regarding this incident, but wanted to personally get an answer from 
the people I vote into government. I was asked a series of questions 
which I believe were inappropriate:

Q: What do you do for a living?
A: I work in Advertising.
Q: Where and what company?
A: I am currently unemployed.
Q: If unemployed how did you get the money to take the trip?
A: I believe I have the right to not answer this question, I would like 
to speak to a supervisor. Agent Torres gets a supervisor.
Q: (to supervisor): I believe I do not have to answer this question. 
Such questioning may violate my rights and civil rights.
A: (from supervisor): Yes, you have to answer all questions no matter 
what he asks. And no, you do not have any rights here, including civil 
rights. We are in charge here and fully control you.
Q: What if I elect not to answer?
A: Then we can and will hold you here with us indefinitely.
Questioning by Agent Torres resumes:
Q: How could you have the money to take a trip if you're unemployed?
A: I had money saved in the bank.
Q: You must have a lot of money saved to be able to take this trip.
A: I'm sorry, I cannot answer any more of these type questions, even if 
it means being detained and having to call an attorney.
Agent Torres proceeded to very slowly search every single item in my 
bags, one by one, opening up even sealed items. I did not see the other 
agents take so long and conduct such an intense search with other 
passengers that when before me.
I was held there for almost 1 and 1/2 hours, until 12:15 A.M.--the last 
one to leave (even the other agents were telling Agent Toress "come on, 
let's go, it's late". My 3 yr. old daughter and wife had to wait all 
that time.

I am an American citizen by birth, and a Veteran who served 2 years in 
the U.S. Army. I do not believe that these agents for CBP / DHS have 
the authority, or right, to tell me I have no rights.  I understand 
that the majority of these agents lack an education beyond H.S., but 
are they not trained to not harass, intimidate and strip U.S. citizens 
of their rights?
My wife who lived under communism said the incident reminded her of 
such a state.
By the way, I am saddened to see your term expire. You have been a 
great Governor.

Thanking you in advance for your kind attention and response to this 
matter.

Per OIR, I believe these need to be addressed to the National Flood Insurance Program through FEMA. Let me know if you know any different.

Dear Honorable Sir, Governor Bush:

Having just finished a project for a 230 acre zoning change from shaded A to unshaded X, I am forced to rely on the Presidential Order initializing a federal OMB Paperwork Reduction Act for enforcement of pay at time costs and expenses spelled out within the OMB #3067-0147 MT-1, LOMA, MT-2, LOMR applications assigned to me.  It was during the accumulation of the support materials  required, that I found a national program within a state regulated infrastructure that was not being state regulated.  The scrutiny of flood insurance policies including the applications with fraudulent information contained there in for our construction dates then reading of 44 CFR 61, 62.  I find the NFIP offered a defaulted number appearing for a line item identified by the words “significant improvement date”  NFIP defaults to 12/31/74.  A building being built  12/31/74 or the date of the first NFIP FIRM map panel are to be listed here.  We are lazy and do not look up panel.  Unfortunately, this date defaults all properties into an “at risk assessment” increased premium and guarantee issue flood policy.   Man is  minimalist so government wins, Florida is paying a 1 + 1/3rd premium increase to NFIP.  This is all well and good until the state becomes involved in insurance and the U.S. Statistical Abstract generates their impact for FL Statistical Abstract number corrections of at risk underwriting.  UF assigns risk management spill over; but, statistical abstracts are unable to differentiate truth from default.  If agents were to follow the statute to the letter of the law upon new mapping, new policy applications, or completion of new datum all new datum would appear to NFIP for underwriting.  

    Agents are to provide in system entry of new datum at new map, new data, new policy application.  “WINK, WINK” if you enter 12/31/74 you don’’t have to do all that.  On our site the production of the two forms known as the Certified Elevation Certificates (2 each site I, and II and 2 Engineer correction error) cost me 24 hours of data entry each pair.  For the two sites it took me 72 hours the Base Flood Elevation datum correction was most significant.  The facts are it would take at least 24 hours in office billable expense for Pine Ridge at Lake Tarpon Village I 

     It appears no agent is willing to do this entry as a project as a mere proposal so it turns into the application and ten years passed our site with two map corrections, three Certified Elevation Certificates produced and 10 new policies.  Where are we to go the state does not regulate NFIP as procedural for error.  Our last 7 years of notice of a need to be removed from flood cost us $495,000.00 the same amount Bilirakis raised in Tampa with our Presidential visit.  Our community is wealthy and could have generated millions but we are lazy and sloppy in our GOP Politics as this Provisionally Accredited Levee effecting our underwriting change has been in existence for 33 years.  We have supported the NFIP in error for 33 years of gross negligence and national insurance non-governed regulation protection costing Billions collectively.  Congressman Bilirakis knew as FLOOD Insurance is a key issue to Tarpon Springs where interconnecting river and bayous hover around mean high tide.  Lake Tarpon Outflow Canal Flood Control Device is USACOE (73) design, SWFWMD managed.  Spring Bayou Epiphany fresh spring source of Lake Tarpon Sink Hole Concrete Gated Control Device at A. L. Anderson Park.  

    You need to read the 44 CFR 61 to 62 requirements to discern a need for policy changes or internal actuating insurance control to meet proper input requirements.  Remove assessed risk by factual underwriting, ask UF.  They used a corrective formula risk correction by Chi square.  This is critical to why CITIZENS was ever needed.  Underwrite by hard facts. Re-assign risk assessments. I have an engineer ready to provide Certified Elevation Certificate production so underwriting can be provided.  

    Send fax number if you require hard copy flood policy information.  Default figures made manifest to me by my involvement in the 230 acre projects.

    

Thanking you in advance for your kind attention to this matter.

  

Sincerely I Remain,

 

Karen Paula Williams 

P.S. You can check with Peter Dunbar to know I am not a crank.  

I spoke to him at a 718 work session forewarning him of his BOCC Client interest i.e. the out flow canal dissemination or non-dissemination f said findings. I was assigned the project of the 230 acre FIRM FEMA zoning change, which is now approved.  And I am awaiting “The Presidential Order” defined time cost burden notice PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OMB #3067-0147 MT-1, MT-2, payment by executive order through counsel John D. Graham, Ph D, .for breach.

Dear Governor Bush:

Please support those who follow the rules regarding immigration.  It is a slap in the face of all of us who try to do the right thing in life to not deport any person here past their visa time or illegally.  These people are driving around without insurance, working under-the-table and not paying taxes.  Crack down on all employers who use them as well.  Heavens, let's ENFORCE THE LAWS of this country and protect our borders today!

If the GOP hopes to be the party that follows the laws of this nation, you must support deportation.  Sadly, the President seems unable to have the guts to stand up for those of us who do obey the law.

Re: Help for an American Soldier


Dear Governor Bush,

My name is Kathryn Vigliatura, I am writing to you to see if you can help me
with a desperate situation with my son, He is a US Army soldier, serving in
Korea, while he was there he met and married his new wife who is of
Philippine decent, she was working in Korea on a work visa and she is now
pregnant with his child. My son is scheduled to return to the USA in
December on a short leave then he is to be stationed in Texas, prior to
deployment to Iraq. The reason I am writing to you is that my son is having
trouble getting a tourist visa for my new daughter-in-law and future
grandchild. We would like to be able to have the baby born in the USA,
seeing as the father is an American soldier serving his country. The
American Embassy in Korea has denied her visa, because she is pregnant.

I am trying to find out who can I contact or what can I do to help them. I
think that if he is willing to put his life on the line to serve our great
country, they might see clear to help a soldier and make sure his child is
born an American. I am begging for any assistance or help that you might be
able to give. If there is a path that I need to take or a person to contact
could you help us? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. I can be
contacted at this e-mail or phone numbers:

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I am writing on behalf on my son Allan Sookdeo who is  mentally ill and I 
am his caretaker.  My son has worked and paid taxes for over 6 years 
before he was diagnosed with schitzophrenia.  To make a long story short 
he is not able to work and is currently on disability.  He has to take 
many medications to keep him sane and he has been using medicare to get 
his medications for the past few years.  All of a sudden on 9/30 I was 
told that his Prescription insurance which is Amerihealth has been 
cancelled.  I have spent countless days and hours on the phone trying to 
find out why, being that his maintenance medications are very expensive 
and are mandatory.  I have been getting a lot of  run around, Medicare 
tells me to call Amerihealth and Amerihealth tells me to call Medicare 
with no resolution.  The other day I finally spoke with a supervisor and 
all they tell me is his insurance is cancelled and he should be on Blue 
Cross/ Blue shield which he never was on, they also informed me 
Amerihealth is no longer doing business in the state of Florida as of 
2007.  They told us that he can re-apply on 11/15 for a different plan and 
it will not be effective until 01/2007??  That is over 2 months away and 
he cannot be without medication for that length of time, he will not be 
mentally stable and may get violent and possibly end up in jail if he 
misses a few days of this medication.  I am on a fixed limited budget and 
I am not able to pay for this medication for my son.  We are currently 
using samples and coupons which his psychiatrist gave us that will run out 
soon.   I am asking today that you please help me get this situation 
resolved.
 

Sincerely,

Mr. Bush, I need you help:
My husband was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease in 2004.  As a result of this diagnosis, he was forced into taking a permanent medical retirement and his 33 year employment with BellSouth was terminated.  His employment was ended in March 2005.  In December 2005, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had the total removal of the prostate.  He has had multiple kidney related issues and has been in the hospital seven times so far in 2006.  He has no control of his bladder and is in constant pain in his knees, back, neck and has numbness in both of his hands.  He is under the care of 3 doctors.  We have applied for social security and have been denied twice constant refrain is "by our determination, you are able to continue your work as a service technician", well it is too bad that BellSouth did not feel that way and terminated him.  After the first denial, he applied for unemployment compensation and that too was denied, their reasoning, he is disabled and therefore is unable to work.  I challenged that and was told that the two departments are not working for the same employer.  I want to make one thing perfectly clear, we are not asking for any charity or any disability income that we have not paid into for years.  We are just wanting to draw on what he has paid into all these years, he has worked and paid into the system since he was 17 years old, he is now 54.  We have hired legal counsel and understand that it takes up to another year to get this before a judge.  He is in constant pain and cannot work.  We have worked and supported ourselves our whole lives and now this.  I can only imagine that the SSA is hoping that they will get lucky and he will die before they have to pay him any of what he has paid into for the last 37 years.  
Please advise us what steps to take, we are at our wits end.

Dear Governor Bush:

My fiance has been living here for about 5 years now, she came here from 
Cameroon Africa to seek her medical degree in Nursing. December '05, she 
graduated Edison College, with scholars, and started working for a local 
health system. Her mother suddenly became Ill this year. The hospital she 
works for(Lee Memorial Health Systems) has been filing her green card for 
a few months now. A  couple of weeks ago we heard from family in Cameroon 
that her mother had fallen deeply ill. We called to try and speed up the 
process to get  a medical leave for her to see her mother. Sunday night, 
10/23 her mother passed away around 2:00am  our time. We contacted the 
lawyers working on her files and they told her she would be held in 
abandonment of her green card filing if she left, and would be unable to 
ever return to the US. We called INS and they gave us so much hope, 3 
different people told us that as long as she had her work authorization 
card, her I-20, and her valid passport that she would be able to get a  
medical release to go home, with restriction to be back to the states 
before her work authorization expires. Which was not a problem as we only 
needed 3 weeks for leave. We then contacted the lawyer to let them know of 
the news and they told her that if she leaves America that all the 
paperwork written up so far would be dropped and that the only way to get 
authorization is to contact her congressman to get travelling papers 
expedited, seeing as to how we are short of our congressman we are seeking 
help from you. My Fiance' was completely devastated, as was I. her mothers 
body is already starting to deteriorate, and the date of burial has been 
moved up to this coming Thursday. My fiance' has not seen her mother in 
over 5 years! Now she is being rejected the right to go home and see her 
mother for one last time before she is laid to rest! Pictures of the  
funeral will never be sufficient enough as would being there holding her 
mothers hand for one last time, and being given the right to grieve  in 
her mothers presence, to give her one more final hug and kiss, to tell her 
how much she loves her. If you are unable to help on this matter, could 
you please tell me or lead me to some direction where we can get expedited 
services. Lee Memorial has contacted the office of Connie Mack on 
wednesday but as of today we have heard no response coming from his 
office. I am very desperate as is the hospital, in getting her home in 
time for burial. I will contact your office tomorrow to confirm that your 
office has received my email.  Please help us on this matter. Thank You 
very much for taking time to read this email.

Dear Governor Bush,
     My son,Jeff Macaione, has been diagnosed "schizophrenic" and is now in Riverside Hospital in Punta Gorda. Jeff is a college graduate and played baseball on a scholarship. A year after he graduated this insidious decease began appearing and progressively became full-blown schizophrenia. He has been unable to work since April,2006,and has been living with me. We applied for Social Security, but Jeff was denied.
     I am a Exceptional Education Teacher in Lee County and spent almost 30 years
as an advocate for ESE children. Now I am fighting for my own son. I would give my life if it meant my son could live a normal life, be able to work , and someday have a family.
    Do you know what it is like to sit by watching your son's personality disintegrate
and be totally helpless? 
    I am asking for your assistance in obtaining social security for Jeff. I have worked since I was 16 and would gladly give him what I have earned in social security. I am also asking for your help in providing more quality hospitals for those experiencing a mental disease. New research indicates that most mental illness is caused by chemical imbalances, no different than in diabetes. There are few places for treatment.
Ninety percent of the homeless have some kind of mental handicap and could possibly be some- what productive if more treatment were available. 
   Please will you help.

           I am hoping to get your help.I have a 23 year old son who would like to join the service.He had some trouble with the law as a juvenile and therefore,he is unable to join.I was hoping maybe you could persuade the US ARMY to take him.He really wants to join.He has had ups and downs his whole adult life.
            To tell you a little about him,he has 2 beautiful children ages 1 and 4.At this time he is unemployed and unable to pay child support.Which is causing major depression for him.He is a very intelligent young man.Has lots of potential in life.I just would like to see him succeed in life.And i am hoping you could help with this, as i know you understand the problems our children of today face.With having young adult children yourself.

Ref:      Naturalization Process
 
            Jorge H. Eran
            Case Type:                    N400
            Receipt #:                     SSC*[REDACTED]
            USCIS Account #           A[REDACTED]
            Filing Date:                    09/13/2004
 
Dear Sir,
 
We began the Naturalization Application Process for my husband in September, 2004. The process took little or no time from the applications beginning until the request was made and given for the final interview and fingerprint taking.  This process took 7 month, with fingerprints taken in April 2005.  He was told at that time, that the process turnaround for finalization and confirmation of Naturalization was about 60 to 90 days, but it could be longer depending on backlogs. Several times during our wait, we called to inquire about his case, my husband was told, and “it was still pending.”  
 
15 months later, he finally spoke with a representative over the phone who explained that his “fingerprints had expired.”  In June, 2006, we drove back to Jacksonville so that he could have his fingerprints redone.  At the time of our trip, the Immigration clerk informed him that it was an error on the part of Homeland Security / Naturalization that his file “sat on a shelf and was never submitted.”  She explained that “it should only be a matter of 30 to 60 days and that he should hear something soon since it has been almost 2 years.”  My husband has inquired twice since his last visit and the last letter we received is enclosed.
 
My husband has been a permanent legal resident alien since 1984.  He has worked in this country for 20 years; he has paid taxes, paid into Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  He is currently a student studying Graphic Design at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville and has student loans. All of his family that arrived here with him from Peru has applied and passed through the Naturalization Process in a matter of months, they are all US Citizens.  
 
I am writing to you as a Citizen, as a tax payer as registered voter, as his wife. I am frustrated with this process.  It has been ongoing for 25 months and now we might have to pay another $300.00 to have his permanent alien card renewed.  We are both students and working people.  We do not make a lot of money. I understand, especially since 9/11, that the process has become more stringent and things are looked at more closely, however we have done everything legally requested by the laws of the state of Florida and the United States concerning the Naturalization process to no resolve.
 
I am writing to you and asking your help with his case.  We do not know where to turn at his point and we are worried that we are receiving the same treatment as before and his file is sitting on a shelf again. 
We understand that this is a busy time of year and our request seems minimal to others, but, it is an important to us.  If you can help us we would greatly appreciate it.
 
Thank you for your time and we hope to hear from you soon.
 
Sincerely Yours,

Dear Governor Bush,
     My son,Jeff Macaione, has been diagnosed "schizophrenic" and is now in Riverside Hospital in Punta Gorda. Jeff is a college graduate and played baseball on a scholarship. A year after he graduated this insidious decease began appearing and progressively became full-blown schizophrenia. He has been unable to work since April,2006,and has been living with me. We applied for Social Security, but Jeff was denied.
     I am a Exceptional Education Teacher in Lee County and spent almost 30 years
as an advocate for ESE children. Now I am fighting for my own son. I would give my life if it meant my son could live a normal life, be able to work , and someday have a family.
    Do you know what it is like to sit by watching your son's personality disintegrate
and be totally helpless? 
    I am asking for your assistance in obtaining social security for Jeff. I have worked since I was 16 and would gladly give him what I have earned in social security. I am also asking for your help in providing more quality hospitals for those experiencing a mental disease. New research indicates that most mental illness is caused by chemical imbalances, no different than in diabetes. There are few places for treatment.
Ninety percent of the homeless have some kind of mental handicap and could possibly be some- what productive if more treatment were available. 
   Please will you help. 
                                                              Sincerely,

Subject:	Movement of 46th Test Wing to Edwards AFB California

Sir,								26 October 2006



I am writing in regards to the proposed move of the 46th Test Wing to
Edwards AFB.  Repeatedly, AFMC leadership has ignored the facts surrounding
the cost effectiveness of this initiative.  Their personal agendas are quite
clear.  When the initial story leaked in the newspapers first there was
denial, then partial truths and then the story of their “experts” had
reviewed this move and verified its cost effectiveness.  To now allow this
same group of people to conduct yet another analysis to determine if the
move to California is cost effective is truly a case of putting the fox in
charge of the hen house.  A transition team remains in place at Eglin and
taskings are being worked daily to try and validate the original assumptions
made by AFMC leadership regarding the move.  Additionally,
the cost analysis needs to address the costs associated with moving and the
subsequent costs associated with the 53rd Wing.  As this is not AFMC, it
will be book kept elsewhere, but it is still a cost to the US Air Force.
The bottom line is that is will cost well over 100 million dollars to build
the infrastructure at Edwards to “bed down” Eglin aircraft and equipment.
This does not even address the costs required to support a stand alone 53rd
Wing.  One of the truly ironic parts of this initiative is that it seriously
reduces or eliminates many aspects of our national Weapons Test and
Evaluation capability…and it seems that AFMC leadership is OK with that.
The military leadership in Air Force Material Command is moving ahead full
steam with this ill thought out plan and I hope and pray that you remain
vigilant to their actions.  Unless someone directly tells the AFMC
leadership to “knock it off” I fear they will continue to do all in their
power to bring this move to fruition.  It may be time to ask your brother to
intervene and stop this dangerous and faulty plan.

Thank you for your continued support.

Dear Govenor,
My name is Heather Walker. My husband and I are from Tampa. We are curently stationed here at Fort Stewart in Georgia. My husband is having some serious problems here with his unit. He was injured severly in Iraq and is pretty much out of work when he gets medically discharged. His back is injured and his only option is surgery. But the other problem is that the military is trying to only give him 10% of his pay or two years retirement. We are pretty much going to be out on the streets when he gets out. But he has been getting alot of reprisal from his unit for being injured. Him and several other soldiers who are injured are getting mistreated severly. Ranking officers are making them go against their profiles for injuries and are treating them poorley. I have contacted several news stations and newspapers. Time Magazine, CNN news and our local newspapers all want to do a story on it, but I wanted to know if there was any way you could help or point us in the right direction. Please, we need something. We can not survive on a hundred dollars a month when he gets out. I thank you for your time and support, god bless you.
Sincerly,
Mrs. Heather Walker
Proud Army Wife

Subject:	Family Immigration status

Dear Governor Bush:
As a political sympathizer and admirer of your efforts
and actions in the state of Florida, I would like to
respectfully ask for you advice, guidance and if
possible assistance on a very delicate situation.
It concerns my immediate family’s wellbeing and legal
immigration status in Florida and the United States. 
The following is the background to better illustrate
the situation and justify the origin of my request.
I’m a US Legal Permanent Resident since 1987, with a
University of Central Florida Business degree and over
12 years of professional experience in the
telecommunications industry. I have held an executive
position with Comcast Cable Communications of West
Florida for the past three years, and having worked
overseas during the last decade I got married and have
a wife and three children all born in Guatemala City.
In April 2003 I choose provide my family with more and
better opportunities by relocating them to Florida as
a result of unemployment and the political and
economical turmoil that prevailed in Latin America. At
that time and based on my Legal Permanent Resident
status I was advised by the US Embassy in Guatemala
City to travel to the US with non-immigrant visas for
my family and proceed to petition for legal residency
when in country. Following those instructions, in
October 2003 I filed the required petitions and
received the approved petition notices in October
2005. Since receiving the approval notices the process
has almost come to a halt, I have not been able to
secure any information or updates on what to do or who
to contact in order to expedite and complete the
process. With all the immigration controversy lately
in the news we fear our petitions may get lost and our
status indefinitely unresolved.
My family and I lead a very busy and involved life in
this great state of Florida. My wife is an orthodontic
surgeon unable to legally work and financially
contribute to our household, so she takes care of the
children and volunteers both at the elementary school
and the local library system. My children despite
being young participate in many extracurricular
activities at school and in the community. My oldest
son at 9 years, has been since enrolling in school an
A student and involved in Student Council; just
recently receiving the principals award for
outstanding citizenship.
I would like nothing more than to be able to securely
provide for my family and for them to enjoy of all the
rights, privileges and obligations that being a legal
US Citizen entitles them to.
Can you please refer me to someone within your office
that can help move on with the process so my children
can soon become legal and productive citizens of this
great country?

With all my respect and gratitude,

Maurice Amaya

Subject:	what are you seriously going to do about this?

I am a concerned college student, who wishes to stay anonymous for certain reasons, but that is not the matter the matter is that I am angry with this approach that immgration has proceeded with and how they did it to deport families that had papers and that have been here in florida for years. 
 
 
There was an article written on the Gaceta Tropical about families that have lost their homes because they didn't know about their rejection to american citizenship: Del sueño a la pesadilla (from a dream to a nightmare). I don't think this is right. Why if these families have been here for so long and they have followed the law to every point do they have to be kicked out of the country because no one sent them a letter that their petition of citizenship has been rejected. This is ridiculous and I know it isn't far from new elections and you are finishing your term as governor, but this is one last thing you SHOULD definately look at. Families from Lee and Collier counties have been given notices that they have to leave the country, while some of the parents are in jail. I ask you this, is it their fault that they weren't sent a letter about their rejection or is it our governments ignorance?

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
You are our last resort with this horrible situation.  I represent the office of Thomas Carrasquillo, MD.  We moved our office on 9-1-06.  I notified Medicare of our move and they received our paperwork on 8-24-06 per their instructions.  All of our Medicare checks have been returned to them by the Post Office and they are holding all the rest.  We have not received any reimbursement from Medicare since 9-1-06.  They do not return calls, and when they do, everyone gives me a different answer.  We are at a very critical level and cannot meet payroll.  95% of our practice is Medicare patients.  As a solo surgeon, this is all we have.
 
All of our other insurance payors, Medicaid, BCBS, UCH have all made their changes...but not Medicare.  This is a disgrace.  If you can forward this or help in any way I would appreciate it.  Sincerely, Barbara Cohen, Office Manager for Thomas Carrasquillo, MD (Medicare ID  36278).  My phone # 239-458-8222, address 1435 SE 8th Terrace Suite B, Cape Coral, FL  33990

To the Governor and Staff

This is not about me, you have helped me plenty, and I really appreciate the assistance.  What this is about is the Medicare insurance through United healthcare I believe there is a problem.  The hospitals in Lee County Lee Memorial, and Southwest regional will no longer do business with United healthcare.  I am not sure where the problem lies either it's with Lee Memorial or United healthcare.  I would like you to look into this because it is very complicated.  I was told that Lee Memorial systems will not use United healthcare because they cannot work out a program for payments, also Lee Memorial is buying other hospitals in the county like Southwest regional which also will no longer take my Medicare complete card through United healthcare.  I would like you to look into this, I know I am not the only one in Lee County with this card, and this is a problem that has to be taken care of before November, because that's when we get to pick, and change policies when you are on Medicare.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am having trouble getting timely verification for my VA loan and am facing a move with nowhere to go. The local office sent a form to verify my VA benefits, in regard to : 317-VSC-MJP-PU; 28-369-938.

Unfortunately, my loan application is still being held up for government verification, because Countrywide cannot find me listed on the Internet website to verify my service (apparently older veterans are not listed) and is holding my VA loan, which is putting me in danger of being without a place to live until the closing, which they will not set until my loan is approved. All that is left to verify are my service and 10% disability (I have submitted the letter and a form to verify these, but apparently they are not enough). In addition, he says they need verification that any previous VA loan was satisfied appropriately. I have given them all my information. Date entered: 1/9/1968 Date released: 9/26/1971 Service Number: AF 11749910. SS [REDACTED]. 

Is there anything that you can do to speed up the process? I have been told by Countrywide that the VA office in Washington, DC, is the only place where they can get this verification and that they are slow.

My lease is up here on October 31st. I have my belongings packed. I have completed all the applications and am approved, pending this verification. I can not get a closing date because of this verification hold up. I started this loan process when I gave my earnest money on September 11th, but did not receive the application packet until October 13th. I met with the associate, Carl Parnell, on October 16th and submitted and signed all forms. Any help you can give me, even if it is just a call or email to Washington to watch for my paperwork and to return it to them as soon as possible, is greatly appreciated.

SUBJECT: Social Security Disability Hearings


COMMENTS: Governor Bush, 

 My attorney has filed my Appeal Hearing with the Social Security Administration Law Judge Officer (judication department) about a year ago. I am still waiting for my hearing. I have just found out recently that the cases being filed electronically are getting the hearings before the paper claims which has been filed for awhile. This is not fair to people like me whom needs some type of income to live on.   Thanks for me serving in the military awhile back, I can seek medical help thru the Veteran's Administration Clinic here in Jacksonville for my medical issues. I also have an appeal with the VA in reference to my Comp and Pension Benefits. Which now is in Washington.

My concern is why are the electronic claims being processed before the paper claims on SSD and SSI hearings. 

Thanks alot for being a great governor.

Subject:	SSI

Sir, my name is Dennis Williams and really need some help with this SSI program. I had a massive heart attack on 12-10-05 and had 60-70%damage to my heart,had to be hit with defibulator 4 times [paddles],have 1 artorie100% clogged and 1 70%.The medical staff tried for a few hours to put in stints but were unable to.I worked most my life in the drywall part of construction and fishing industry but missed getting SSD because of way some of the boats and drywall companies paid or didn't pay our tax. Anyhow, since I had no insurance when this happened the Doctors who worked on me at Bayonet point hospital in Hudson wouldn't see me w/o insurance or cash,so all I've been able to do since is get my medication with only a 5 dollar visit charge at a local clinic, but no treatment of any kind.I've filed and been denied twice now for SSI,mainly because I haven't been able to see any doctors besides the one's Social Security have sent me to-which is a story all it's own. 1 is a bone specialist and the other did NOTHING except take my blood pressure. A man who lives a couple house's down from where I am at just had surgery for ulcers and a problem with a blood vessel in stomach and he got his SSI and medicaid on his 1st time applying but won't say HOW. Now my situation is a LOT more critical than his yet all I get is the run around and denials and this is my life at stack.My attack was so massive that they wanted to do open heart surgery right then but the damage was so severe that they told my family I wouldn't survive.I really need this surgery,I don't like wondering if I'll wake up the next day or having to live off all these pills, which have really got my liver and kidney messed up.This isn't like a sore arm or back or ulcers, this is my heart. Do I have to die twice before something can be done? I doubt I'll be so lucky next timeIs there any way you can have someone check into this.I see all these people who have it and I can't understand why or how. Sure some of them need it but alot others I just don't understand. My name is Dennis Williams and ss# is [REDACTED] and can be reached at 727-857-0579 and this e-mail. Thank you!

Subject:	Corruption

Hello sir I just wanted to inform you of the corruption going on between FEMA and contractors. Tom Hunter and Vickie Pozzi started out a company named Discovery RV Marine Maint. LLC. They are running it under Florida Waterfront Group. They are both based out of Ft.Pierce Florida. Tom and Vickie used to subcontract for RV Services owned by Bruce Mazoc who used to be in Ft.Pierce Florida but has relocated to Texas. Tom was transporting a FEMA moblie home and wrecked it into a tree. Tom, Bruce and Joe Diangelo(head of the Fema staging area in Ft.Pierce) hid this inccident from Bruce's insurance so it would not go up, they also hid it from FEMA. Tom Hunter was in charge of deactivation of the FEMA travel trailers for RV Maintence. He stole parts of the travel trailers such as spare tires, propane tanks, dvd players, cd/radio players, refridgerators, axles, the list goes on. This went on for three years. He would then sell them on the side and charge FEMA for them saying they were damaged and could not be reused. Now  Tom Hunter is paying off Joe Diangelo for information on upcoming contracts and recomendations from him. He is giving his son also named Joe money in envelopes to give to his father. He also has let his son work for him and overpays him. His son was hauling FEMA travel trailers without the proper insurance on his truck because he is to young to obtain it. Tom Hunter and Vickie Pozzi have not paid taxes for three years on the money they made from RV Services. Bruce Mazoc the owner of RV Services is in trouble with the IRS currently. Tom and his wife Christine have a non-profit called either Christom or Tomstine where they are trying to hide this money. Tom and Vickie are now under Florida Waterfront Group and are paying their employees cash so they don't have to pay taxes. Vickie Pozzi has an arrest record in Illinois for shoplifting mutliple times and she is still allowed to subcontract for the government. It is amazing that they are still working for FEMA with everything going on with FEMA and all the corruoption being brought out. Michael who runs the Florida Waterfront Group is also involved. These people (Tom Hunter, Vickie Pozzi, Bruce Mazoc, Joe Diangelo, and Michael) should not be allowed to contract from the government and represent them. I know all of this because i used to subcontract also and seen this first hand. I think it wrong and should be stopped. I have contacted the local media in St.Lucie county and they are very interested in the events that happened and are still going on. I figured I would contact you also because I have a lot of respect for you and your father and hope you can put a stop to these people and bring them to justice. Tom Hunter and Christine Hunter's current address is 521 Center Road Ft.Pierce Florida and they still have alot of the stolen parts from the FEMA trailers there on the yard. I hope you will take action and I don't have contact  the media again. Thankyou Sir.

Dear Governor Bush:

I hate to bother you but I am trying to find out if something I have heard 
is true and thought maybe you might know. I was told that it is now 
mandatory that one pays for the insurance that you get when going on 
social security which is now at 88 dollars a month. My curiousity in this 
is because I do not see how anyone can force anyone to pay for something 
and especially when the payment is not cheap and the coverage is not good 
either. I am on social seucurity disability and I do not pay for the 
insurance because either way I couldn't afford to go to the doctor and one 
can bet that if I am forced to pay any 88 dollars a month I wont be able 
to afford the doctors co-pays and medications even more than if I didn't 
have insurance.
 
I do at least now get to just save my money so that if I absolutely must 
go to the doctor I can do so and pay the cost out of my pocket and as is 
now the doctors do provide me with as much of the medications from their 
sample cabinets to help defer some of the cost but if I have to pay out 
any 88 dollars a month I will not be able to go to the doctor even when it 
becomes an absolute must because the co-pays and medications are too much 
expense and nobody will be ever so kind to help me with samples because 
they are so stupid to have it in their head thinking that the word 
insurance means you can now afford anything when that just is not so and I 
have found that I am worse off with insurance than I have been without it 
as far as the expense is concerned.
 
Its just a bunch of bull and also communistic if they can now force people 
to pay for their crappy medicare insurance crap cuz the crap isnt even 
worth a darn crap as it is piss poor coverage and not worth one dime. I 
hope you can answer my question and I am so hoping they cannot force 
anyone to pay out anything as that is most certainly communistic rule and 
something to be feared by all for our government to be given such power. 
Thank You, Cherry

P.S. The reason I have an apartment address below is because I lost my 
home of ten years in hurricane Jeanne and fema was the biggest joke of all 
time and I did not get one ounce of help from anyone in this world 
whatsoever and have had to dig my way back up hill all by myself and one 
can bet that I have a whole new outlook on mankind as I view mankind to be 
the most useless, most self centered, most inhumane, most incompassionate 
of all of God's creations !!

Dear Governor Bush:
 
My husband and I recently took a weekend trip to the Miami area from our home here in Sun City Center.  While we were there we realized English is a second language (at best).  No we were not in Little Havana, we thought maybe we had drifted there. but that was not it.  No matter where we went, Doral, Coral Gables, South Beach etc., English was not spoken.  We felt like strangers in our own country.
 
This is an utter disgrace!!!  These immigrants did not come here to become Americans they came here to alter our American lifestyle.  The reason America has worked so well for immigrants has been the one unifying achievement.  We all speak English!  My grandparents on both sides were immigrants they didn't come off the Mayflower!  I was raised on Long Island, New York, where diversity thrives and has for many years.
 
The laws must be changed.  The wet foot/dry foot law must be changed.  Illegal immigration must be stopped.  All people who wish to immigrate to our country must all be treated equally.  Not special interests to get votes.
 
We are ready to pass the English only bill.
 
Thank you

I am writing to you because I need your help and influence. I recently was denied by Social Security for disability benefits. I had lower lack surgery on 3/10/05, which entailed getting a titanium plate and 4 pedicle screws put  in my lower back and was in the hospital for more than 1 week. I tried to work in 8/05 but it was a unsuccessful attempt. The pain was too great. I cannot sit or stand for more than 30 minutes at a time. I have had 2 Medical Doctors who DO NOT work for Social Security and both diagnosed me with FLBSS-Failed Lower Back Surgery Syndrome. 
 
I have complied with everything that Social Security has asked of me including seeing their Doctors. Even their Psychologist agreed this was a medical problem. So why the denial?
 
I am the daughter of Lt Col. Charles BE Curtis who was a fighter pilot in the United States Airforce for 20 years. It would of been longer but he mysteriously died of Stomach cancer.
 
I have worked for Medical Doctors myself for close to 20 years. I have hired a firm "Binder & Binder-Social Security Advocates", in which they do not charge unless they win.
 
I have not been able to work since my surgery, I am having to sell my home of 9 years because I have no money to pay our mortgage. I've gone from 126lbs to 99lbs. 
 
Sir I beg you to please help expedite my appeal and do anything possible that could help me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am loosing everything.
 
Yours Truly,

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
You are our last resort with this horrible situation.  I represent the office of Thomas Carrasquillo, MD.  We moved our office on 9-1-06.  I notified Medicare of our move and they received our paperwork on 8-24-06 per their instructions.  All of our Medicare checks have been returned to them by the Post Office and they are holding all the rest.  We have not received any reimbursement from Medicare since 9-1-06.  They do not return calls, and when they do, everyone gives me a different answer.  We are at a very critical level and cannot meet payroll.  95% of our practice is Medicare patients.  As a solo surgeon, this is all we have.
 
All of our other insurance payors, Medicaid, BCBS, UCH have all made their changes...but not Medicare.  This is a disgrace.  If you can forward this or help in any way I would appreciate it.

Dear Governor,
 
Is there anything you can do to help someone with their social security disability after they're denied? I have a rare neuromuscular condition, known as Cervical Dystonia and continue to come up to brick walls with trying to get my SSI and SSDI. Dystonia is rare (300,000 in U.S.). If you would be so kind, I would like for you to watch the documentary on PBS on January 30th, called, "Twisted." It is put out by Blind Dog Films, and depicts life with Dystonia in different people. I will be on local radio (WPSL AM) in Port Saint Lucie on November 20th to talk about the disorder, which I have had since 2002. It is my hope that you can somehow tune in and listen to the show, which starts at 11:15 a.m. and goes until 12 noon. I hope that you can listen in to the show. I also recently wrote an article about it that will be in the Treasure Coast magazine, "The Local Buzz Magazine" November issue. You can pick up a copy at either the Lyric or the Sunrise Theatres in Martin or St. Lucie counties, as well as other locations. I have attached a Press Release about the documentary film, and am hoping there is something that you can do to help me to get my SSI and SSDI pushed through. I have been waiting since 2004. My parents are both retired, and cannot financially help me enough. I need the SSI and SSDI as well as the health coverage of Medicare or Medicaid in order to have necessary tests done. My health has been suffering. I now have a lump in my left breast that I cannot pay to have tested further. Please help if you can. Thank you for your help, in advance. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dana B. O'Kane

I have been dealing with an awful lot of mistakes on my child's disability case! I am extremely disappointed in the way it is being handled. I am disabled and had to go to the extent of hiring an attorney to wait another year and a half just to go to a alj hearing that to me was ridiculous, my 6 yr. old daughter has a very serious mental brain disease she is schizophrenic, this disease runs in my family and they receive benefits to live! My child was kicked out of pre-school failed knidergarten and now failing first grade, noone is able to deal with this but me. school just looks the other way and offers absolutely nothing! Now, she is being denied her medical benefits through dcf as well as her food stamps. I live on disability and that only pays my rent, her father lives in another state and lives with his mom, therefore offers nothing to the child financially. I feel my daughter was wronged and that at this time you personally should  authorize her payments that she has now been denied for 3 times and not getting anywhere with the recent alj hearing! i feel after years of counseling and many medications and a mental hospital stay, she needs her benefits paid immediately! what are you able to do for my child? I have been told to at this point to contact you this told me from my attorney! Please respond asap! thank you so much for your valuable time!  Child's name: Marla dae-Estelle Atnip...

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
Can you or someone please explain why, when someone applies for Social Security Disability, they are ALWAYS turned down the first/second/third time -- but once an attorney gets involved, the process is suddenly successful??
 
Why must it be that citizens who should qualify the first time they apply must hire a lawyer and ultimately split money that should have been granted without investing in legal counsel?  What can a lawyer do that the average disabled citizen is unable to do??
 
It seems like a sleazy game.  Isn't the disability itself enough of a burden??
 
Thank you for your time.

Governor Bush,
 
                    I am writing to complain about the length of time that it takes to receive a hearing on Social Security Disability in the state of Florida.  I applied in Dec. 2004 , was denied and had to appeal.  Was denied again, had to request a hearing. That was in March of 2005.  It is now Oct 2006 and I am still waiting for my hearing.  I have been told it will most likely be in Feb. 2007.  Now I realize that I am not the only person waiting.  But I believe that is an excessively long time.  I have many health problems and can no longer receive Medicaid from the state because of their policies.  I have no children under the age of 18 and have not been approved for disability.  So I can no longer to the Dr. or get my prescriptions filled. Do you think that making people wait two years for I hearing is fair.  I believe that they do it just to discourage people from applying.

Importance: High


Sir:  I have a complaint to make.  Early in the month of May, 2006 I made an appointment on line to go over to the Homeland Security Office, Tradeport, Orlando, Florida to get my Alien Registration Card renewed (it was expiring on September 24, 2006) and I knew at that time that I was going to visit my aging relatives in Wales in the month of September.
 
Upon arriving at the office, I spoke with a very nice lady in the office and she explained that they no longer renew the Alien Registration cards at that office but that I can do this on line.  Coming back to the office I completed all the necessary forms - and completed the data on how to pay on line for this renewal ($260.00) from my Debit Card.  Within a couple of days, my debit card showed the withdrawal of these monies (middle of the month of May) and then waited and waited.  I emailed a request for a response because I wanted to get my card renewed prior to my leaving the States (September 6-22) and all I received in the mail was a certificate acknowledging receipt of the monies: 
 

I recently filed - on-line - my application for renewal of my Green Card - Alien #A-[REDACTED] - and did receive a receipt - MSC-06-801-84068
 
I waited and waited and waited, I sent one email after another and no reply.  I did a certified mail with return receipt to Los Angeles, got the green card back with a signature - but still nothing.  I had to leave on September 6th, 2006 without my card being renewed.
 
Upon my return I did receive a response - a letter stating to report on the date attached on another letter.  It gave me the information on the times etc. and then someone had scratched out the date and whited it out with Liquid Paper and in big writing stated FULL - a lot of good that did me.  I'm now stuck here waiting to hear, I cannot go on a cruise or leave the country because I do not have my card renewed.  But here is the other part of this story.
 
I was going to Wales because I had two relatives that were getting on in age, and a brother that was in ill health.  A couple of days before I left I received a call from my sister in law to let me know that my brother - James McKinty - had a stroke and was in the hospital but that when he was out he would have to rest in bed.  My brother was in a medically induced coma upon my arrival and sad to say he had another catastrophic stroke and they removed the breathing tube on Saturday, September 18th, 2006.  His funeral was set for Monday, September 25th - and yes - you can see what I'm getting to - I could not stay for the funeral because my card expired on the 24th, so I had to stick with my reservation.  Nevertheless I was devastated, relatives that I was unable to see during my vacation came from all over to James funeral and I could not attend.  So Sad, you do not know how bad I feel that my family was not there to see me pay my last respects to the last of my immediate family.  I'm the only one left.
 
Please can you look into why it takes so long to get my card renewed.  I have been in this country since 1961 and always have been able to get this done immediately.  It did state in the latest communiqué that it would take 4-6 months but why after all my communications did I not even get the courtesy of a reply.  Shameful.  It is no over 5 months - my money was taken fast enough.  Looking forward to a reply from you. Thanks

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would like to start by saying how proud I am to live in Florida and to have you as the Governor.  I have been a Florida residence since 12/96.  I lived the rest of my life in Ohio where we could not count on our Governor or others in office.
 
It makes me very proud to say I live in Florida and I stand up for what you are doing and have done for this state.
 
The reason I am writing you is that as of April 2005 I have been unable to work due to my health.  My health still has not improved for me to return to work.  I have worked since I was 14 years old by example of my parents.  Thank God for my parents and the morals they instilled in me.  
 
I need your help, I filed for disability through Social Security April 2005.  I have been denied twice and had to hire an attorney.  I was recently told that it could be another 18 months before we have a hearing before the Judge.  My attorney said there is 3 judges who handle the cases and they can only do 40 a day.  We have to wait our turn that we are in a pile like all of the other 7500.  That many die before there case ever goes before the Judge.  
 
We can't afford to wait much longer.  Every month that goes by puts us deeper in the hole financially.  We never expected that I would not be able to return to work.  I have gone to every county agency to get assistance but was told that either my house payment was too high or my husband makes too much money.  Our church has helped as much as they could.  We are not one for gifts or charity but when your back is against the wall you do what you can.  We have cut our expenses to the bare bones.
 
If we were to try and sell the house we would be taking a loss.  Still would have to live somewhere.  Since my husband is a heart patient, I try to handle as much of the finances to allow him to focus on work and not be stressed.  I have not been successful as he is stressed daily between my health, our finances and the possibility of loosing our home.
 
We need your help!!  Governor Bush is there anything you can do to assist us?  Look forward to hearing from you.  Appreciate any assistance you can give.

Good afternoon! My name is Brittany Rainey. I am contacting you because my step-dad is in a bind. He is trying to get his green card to stay in the US. The department of immigration has been tosing him around from person to person. Today he traveld to Brandon to get his photograph taken for his green card. I honestly dont know much of the process to get it. We have hired an immigration attorney to help us but he has been no help what so ever, we have spent thousands of dollars for application after application and still, no results, he has been nothing but a perfect person in this country. He has built a company with my mom and has a home and a family. He has never been in any trouble, all he wants to do is become a part of this country and it seems like its so much harder for him than any other person. I am quite scared because i do not want to lose my step-dad. 

I dont know if I am going about this the right way by contacting you. Its the only way that I could think of to maybe get this situation resolved. Please, please, please, if you can help, that would be the BEST thing that has happend to my family. I know you are very busy, if theres anything that can be done, i will be extreamly extreamly greatful!!!!!

My son is 19 year high school graduate from Sarasota Military Academy, after high school he wanted to join the Armed forces.  Needless to say, 
was denied due to has plate in his right arm from 8th grade football injury.  Kevin, my son has not any problems with his right arm, he is physical fit and is left handed. 
 
To make a long story short, I am single mom working three jobs and barely making a living and have one vehicle.  And every time my son try's to work, conflicts with my work schedule.   
Last straw he tried again to join the United States Coast Guard.  And again was denied for his arm.  He is a terrific kid and it bothers me he really trying to make effort to make decent living and wants to help people.  Eventually wants to be paramedic firefighter.  
 
I am not sure you will be reading this email or not.  I do not know where to turn anymore for assistance.

As it comes as no surprise to me, I have waited as told, for sixty plus days to find out their is No application in progress for my request for benefits for my son under my awarded disability benefits. I called your office sixty plus days ago to start the application process and was told to take my sons birth certificate to my local office and that would start the process. I called twice since then and emailed several times in regards to the progress and was told nothing but that it took up to sixty days to process. Now after several emails through social security's site trying to check on it, Have I been told to call and found out there is nothing on going at all. I am so disturbed by this. Someone majorly dropped the ball. I truly do not appreciate it. I would like information as to who I can send this information to so it may not happen to someone else. There is no excuse in this.

I realize this is a federal mess, but I would like you  to know what is happening in Florida, and in the off chance you decide to run for President in a few terms, I hope you will remember this as an example of what many of the 'core' of this country are enduring at the hands of a sprawling government that no longer serves us, but instead dictates:

FEMA has greatly expanded its flood zones in Flagler County, and although they have erroneously placed my home (405 County Rd 335 ) within "AE" when we are 5' above the Base Flood Elev., we are forced to spend $350 just to prove that with a new survey for FEMA, and STILL are facing a $1200 insurance premium increase for this because Congress has mandated our mortgage company require this!      The north 300' of my 12 acres was by the county canal my grandfather allowed them to dig and was in flood zone "A" before July, but now they’ve exploded "A" into an "AE" zone that covers my whole 12 acres including my home surveyed at 32'. (BFE is 26.5 or 27' here, depending on whether you believe FEMA’s local chart or their local map) Clearly they did not do sufficient elevation sampling before they lumped my home into a flood zone,c ausing us an additional $1200 a year flood insurance, mandated by Congress !

Now, to file for a LOMA (FEMA's map amendment red tape)  , I will have to spend hundreds or thousands more, and more hours to correct the federal government's mistake ! Classic case of federal interference--the flood insurance program was a boondoggle from the start and now because some people naturally took advantage of it by re-building in true flood areas, the rest of us are being penalized when we did not build in a risk area and when we chose obviously high ground to build upon. Why are those of us living inland, high and dry having to pay for other’s idiocy !? 

I have been a Republican  for years,  but I have not seen an improvement at all in government spending or costs such as this. This makes me believe in Term Limits even more and wonder if the Libertarians have a better answer. This mandatory ‘flood’ insurance, at $1200 per year, even after my private survey on FEMA’s form, represents further government taking of property rights and FEMA can't even explain their zoning... they hide behind "very complicated" etc.     I served on the local county planning board as chairman for years and I know how the bureaucrats work–they hope to wear the average citizen down, while large developers or corporations have the ability to thumb their noses.

This appears to be another 'present' to the insurance companies and it makes me livid. Anything the federal government touches turns to a sorry, expensive mess and as I see it, the Republican Congress can only be improved by getting some ‘real’ businesspeople and homeowners, etc. to represent us and scale back this travesty in Washington, which IS a true swampland.

 My mortgage company says they must impose this insurance requirement because Congress mandates it. Homeowner insurance in Florida is already too high for those of us never making claims, and protecting ourselves from fire and floods by our construction methods and site location/layout!    I suspect Congress mandates it because too many claims were made upon Congress’ own flood insurance entitlement experiment. A citizen should not be required to spend hundreds to show FEMA its map is inaccurate and we should not have to buy FEMA’s new flood maps because they choose not to put them online–their own people could not even send me the proper map for my home when I gave them the ‘old’ map number as a guide!  And I had to pay for their mistake--I am STILL waiting for the correct map to be mailed because they won't share these online.    Can't FLorida's government buy the state's maps and put them on Florida's website somewhere?      Government needs to get out of our lives or we become a more Socialist country, and that obviously has not worked elsewhere. Washington just does not ‘get it.'   I wonder if Florida is far behind, when the water management districts tax us but let developers do as they wish.  It is interesting that the Palm Coast development  across the canal with elevations lower than my property by 5' or more, is NOT a flood zone and it drains into the same county canal.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Mr. Governor,

I am writing you in regards to my good friend and co-worker Carlos Helou 
and family.  They have also asked for help from Oprah.  Here is a copy of 
a plea asking for help.

Craig:

As I have probably mentioned to you, my family and I will have to leave 
the United States in March due to the end of our second consecutive 
working visa.  It has become very difficult to change our status to 
residents, and therefore Penpower/GE will not be able to help me with 
this.  As a matter of fact we called several lawyers and no one is willing 
to represent us.  Because we both have college degrees, speak fluent 
English and I have a good job, we are labeled as “displacing an American 
out of a good job” and therefore not allowed to stay beyond our temporary

As a last resource we are trying to get the Oprah Winfrey production team 
involved to research the way the immigration cases are handled and see if 
we can find a solution to our problem.

Social unrest in Argentina is on the rise. Our return to Argentina, even 
if temporary, represents a high risk of kidnapping for our child because 
of her accent she could easily be mistaken for an American.  We are trying 
to avoid running this risk and therefore would like to stay in America and 
continue to enjoy our freedom and pursue of happiness.  The American 
people have been amazing hosts and most people do not want us to go.

We have applied for Canadian residency, but this process may take many 
months, even several years and we would rather stay in America than having 
to start all over again.  

Here is a link to Oprah.  Scroll down on this web page and, please send 
her a note letting her know that you would like us to be able to stay in 
the country.  It is very important that you start the message with 
“Regarding Silvina Lanusse and Carlos Helou from Argentina”.

Message to Oprah:

Regarding Silvina Lanusse and Carlos Hélou

Dear Oprah:

Two days ago my wife, Silvina Lanusse wrote to you regarding our status in 
the US.  We are a couple from Argentina with a 10-year-old daughter.  We 
both dreamt of immigrating to the US for as long as we can remember.  We 
both learned and speak English fluently and we both hold college degrees 
from good American colleges.  We were student in Massachusetts in the late 
80’s and early 90’s.  After college and when our student visa came to an 
end we returned to Argentina, were we both gathered valuable work 
experience and in 2001, a few days before 9/11, I was invited to work in 
the US.  Since then I have been involved in Wind Energy with GE, and I 
feel honored to have help America become more “green.”  Our child is an 
amazing student and my wife, because she does not have a working permit, 
has been volunteering her time in schools and other activities in order to 
give more than what we take.  America has been a great host and we are 
very happy living here in freedom and in the pursue of happiness.  By now 
our daughter is as American as apple pie.

Next March (2007) our second consecutive working visa will expire and we 
will have to leave the country.  Immigration processes have become so 
cumbersome, that even though the company I work for would like me to 
continue working with them, they have discourage me from trying to become 
a resident.  I can’t blame them, given the difficulty of this process.  I 
have called several other lawyers and no one is willing to offer their 
services. They believe we do not have a case.  We are being punished for 
having an education and being labeled as “displacing an American out of a 
good job”.  Curiously enough, my traveling job is not very attractive to 
the average worker, but it is difficult to prove that to the authorities.

The State of Florida has right now a shortage of teachers.  My wife has 
excellent teaching skills and a passion for children that could be very 
valuable.  However, the state is not willing to work towards her 
residency.  It simply makes no sense.  

While hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant cross the borders every 
year, settle down in America and stay with all benefits, people like us 
are denied a two months extension for my child to finish school.  We 
refused to stay in an illegal status, for we believe that we must not 
disrespect our host country.  However our future looks grim. Social unrest 
is on the rise in Argentina and life down there has become very dangerous, 
particularly for a young girl with an American accent.  The possibilities 
for us down there are very limited to none.  On the other hand we believe 
we are the type of immigrants that America can benefit from, people with 
an open mind, no political or religious agenda and willingness to work 
hard and always try to give to our community more then we take. 

We are writing to you, not only in regards to our particular case, but in 
behalf of the many educated immigrants that are of great value to America 
and are not given the chance to stay because of their unwillingness to be 
illegal immigrant and break the law.  It is almost like reverse 
discrimination.  Educated people are given fewer chances then other 
immigrants.

Please, consider having a program were we can expose this situation and 
find a more humane solution to this problem, while helping America keep 
its skilled immigrant work force.    Thank you,

Carlos Helou



As a veteran of "Iraqi Freedom" in the US Navy I would like think that if 
someone tries to do it the correct way that they would be rewarded.  So 
Mr. Governor can you please help our frienda stay in our beloved Country.  

Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] Daughters Pledge

Dear Governor Bush,

The motive behind this letter obtains concern for our father's immigration 
situation, or lack there of. Our father, Francisco Javier Lopez, arrived to 
the United States of America in the year of 1981. A Nicaraguense, born and 
raised, he arrived to the states due to political upheavals occurring in 
Nicaragua throughout the eighties. A father of four American born citizen 
daughters, whom are so rightfully writing this letter, are in mere disbelief 
of the process that our father is undergoing to receive his residency. Our 
father is a responsible man living in the United States, whom has paid his 
taxes and dues, and does not take this country’s opportunities for granted. 
My father is only guilty for his determination, and thrive to live the 
typical American dream, which only America fully depicts. Due to 
bureaucracy, my father has been limited in obtaining the privilege of 
becoming an American
citizen, or even successfully proceeding with the process of becoming one.

   Our father, Francisco, arrived to his final interview with the INS in May 
of this year. During this interview,the INS coordinator brought hope to our 
family, by assuring that our fathers’ matter will be taken care of. It was 
said he would be receiving his alien card within ten days, 240 hours to be 
exact. She even proceeded with recording our fathers’ finger prints. 
Unexpectedly, absolutely nothing came, absolutely nothing was received, and 
a sense of worry and concern began to fill the atmosphere of this ceaseless 
situation. Our parents decided to bring the obstacle to a higher standard. 
They contacted local congressman Mario Diaz Balart merely to receive 
disappointing news that our fathers file is presently placed in a desk 
filled with large amounts of other applicant’s applications, as it had been 
before the "progress" had been made. It was also said that it was up to the 
mercy of the INS to review his file. Apparently, the progress our father has 
made in the attempt to receive his residency came down to pieces upon 
greeting those unsatisfactory reports.

   Our father has found himself in a critical direction, and his four 
daughters are determined to raise any measure it takes to help him receive 
the residency that he has rightfully earned. Our father complied with 
absolutely every aspect of this process, and though we know that patience is 
a crucial factor in the citizenship process, please bear in mind that we are 
discussing over twenty years of my father residing in this country, and six 
of those twenty years of him sitting around in the same spot. On behalf of 
Francisco Javier Lopez, we do not want to see our father wait around 
anymore, and we do not appreciate INS coordinators pulling my father back 
and forth as if he was some kind of ignorant fool. Do understand that my 
fathers file has been placed in the INS office since the year 2000. Despite 
everything else written, there have been two very frustrating occurrences in 
which our fathers’ immigration situation has been caught in the way of our 
family resolving matters. An uncle of the family, who lives in Nicaragua, 
had found his health in a sudden and extremely critical condition. Our uncle 
was placed in extreme intensive care in a nearby hospital, this past April. 
As a family, we understood that it was more than appropriate to embark on an 
urgent trip to Nicaragua to sit right by a relative that was going through 
severe health obstacles. Unfortunately, the trip had been cut down to five, 
due to my fathers’ inability to participate in such an emergency trip, and 
was not present at a time where his presence served as vital importance. My 
father pleaded for a re-entry and had to pay one-hundred and sixty dollars. 
He was still not able to participate in such a significant trip back to 
Nicaragua. The second occurrence occurred during the middle of this summer. 
Our fathers’ license has been expired since July 2006. While in the process 
of renewing his license, the DMV informed our father that he needed original 
documents from the INS to support that he is fully entitled to reside in 
this country. In simple terms, my father was prohibited to receive his new 
license due to the very troublesome and changeless case with these 
immigration matters. Just for your awareness, our father lives a hectic 
maintained schedule, and driving is a necessity for his daily activities and 
responsibilities, such as going to work, running errands, dropping off his 
children, etc.

   With all that is expressed in this letter, you may understand why we have 
chosen to contact and write this letter to you. We anticipate to witness you 
lend out your hand and help our father as well as our family; the 
opportunity to behold our father live up to his goal to become an American 
citizen, along with attaining a peace of mind that he has so rightfully 
earned. We understand that there are plenty other applicants in the same 
position as my father, but this matter has passed boundaries, and has come 
to a point where my father is unable to drive, or even visit Nicaragua at 
times where his presence is valued and needed. Our father is a responsible, 
accountable, competent individual that has been limited, confined, and 
restricted to meet and accomplish all of his wondrous expectations. Not to 
mention, that he has been lied to and treated as a fool a number of times. 
So do not misconstrue the bluntness we have chosen to apply to this letter. 
If you can bear in mind that we are vivid, and adequate American citizens 
which have taken advantage of our freedom of expression to help enable and 
support our father to reach one of his most important and urgent objectives. 
As daughters of a man that has been restricted and confined, we will go to 
no limit, and proudly label ourselves as tough customers who will stop at 
nothing. The answer “no” or no actions made to resolve this situation will 
not be acknowledged. Our entire family has always supported and been loyal 
to the Republican Party, in which two of us have already declared our 
encouragement. I hope you gather this letter with much consideration and 
appreciation, and we are anticipated to be approached with positive answers, 
and a soon resolution to this matter. We are American citizens filled with 
apprehension, hope, and faith to hear from you soon, and to finally grant 
our father a goal that he is beyond adequate to deserve. We appreciate your 
time and expected consideration. Thank you.

Mr Governor,
 
My name is Matthew Ogilvie, I have been a resident of the United States since November of 2000, I have been living here legally since 1997. I am married to a US Citizen and have 2 children. In 2002 I left the country for a period of a couple weeks to attend a funeral in Australia and have since discovered that due to this I have been deemed ineligible for any government assistance for a period of 5 years from my re entry date.
 
I feel that this is extremely unfair and violates my rights as a human being, A common criminal would be shown more compassion than what I have been shown. I feel like I have been unfairly discriminated against based on my national origin. Attending a funeral is not something that anyone enjoys and to be punished or excluded from public assistance due to attending this is morally wrong. 
 
I currently can not vote however I am in the process of obtaining my citizenship and since I can not currently vote I am a pretty low priority. I simply do not understand why the United States appears to care for the welfare of people living in other countries more than people who contribute to its own country and punishes them for leaving for something like a funeral. I feel that my rights not as an American resident but my rights as a human being have been violated by your state.

Hello, Mr. Bush.  My name is Emelyne Museaux.  I am 21-years old and 
although I am an intelligent woman in a land full of oppurtunity, there is 
one thing standing in the way of all that oppurtunity- my lack of American 
citizenship.  I have lived in the United States since I was five years old.  
Although I was born in Haiti, this country and its culture are all that I've 
ever known.  I came here with my mother in 1990, and haven't looked back.  I 
have excelled in my school work but even so, I have had to watch people who 
were less intelligent than myself pursue higher education while I could not, 
simply because I am not a resident of the U.S.  Please believe that my 
mother and I have tried all legal avenues to attain at least residency, but 
they have not been in our favor.  When we appeared before the immagration 
judge, we were denied asylum and we are now in appeal proceedings. As you 
can imagine, we have little or no hope of convincing one judge to overturn 
the decision of another.  This is why I am writing to you now.  You are the 
governor of this great state, the only place that I've ever called home.  If 
it is within your heart and within your power to take some time out of your 
very busy schedule, please meet with my mother and I and give us a chance to 
become a part of this great nation, instead of being forced to go back to a 
country of uncertain future.  In my heart, I am as American as anyone and I 
want only the chance to prove that.  I can be reached at (754) 235-3390.  
Thank you.

Importance:	High

My name is Jonathan A. Vazquez I am in the United States Army and currently serving my second tour in Iraq. I am having some issues about promotion that I would like to address but first a little about myself. I was born in The Bronx, New York and lived there till I was 7 years old, I then moved to Lakeland, Florida which I am still a resident. I joined the United States Army 2 April 2002 as a Military Police Officer. Since I have been in the Army I have served in Iraq from March 2003 to March 2004, I then served as a Traffic Accident Investigator until April 2006 when I moved to the 410th Military Police Company. In June my unit deployed to Baghdad, Iraq where I am now serving a year long deployment. 

The issue that I am having is regarding promotion to the rank of Sergeant. I went to the promotion board 11 November 2005. I was promotable with 463 points as of 1 January 2006 but promotion points were at 798. I then started working on Correspondent Courses to build up on promotion points. April 2006 I started a reevaluation packet for my promotion points adding a Combat Action Badge (15 points) and adding 161 Correspondent Course hours (32 points) which would then add up to be 510 points. 3 May I had my Company Commander sign my reevaluation memorandum and I then turned it into my Company personal NCO. The time period for a reevaluation is normally two months which would have made my updated points affective 1 August 2006. On 1 September 2006 points dropped to 506 but since my packet had not been received they did not add my points. I had a meeting with my 1SGT which stated that the 720th MP Battalion SGM (SGM Craig) would work on the problem. I went to IG (Inspector General) 13 September 2006 to see if they could find, fix, or narrow down the problem. I meet with a SFC Orencia which had me write a statement regarding my situation in detail. Instead of dealing with III Corps he interned called my Battalion SGM and spoke with him and now IG has closed the case due to SGM Craig once again stating that he was going to work on it. It is now 26 September 2006 and all I would like to happen is for someone to help me find out why my points were never added like they were supposed to be by August 2006 and if and when this issue gets fixed will I get back dated for pay and date of rank to 1 September 2006. My direct chain of command ie. Team leader, Squad Leader, and Platoon Sgt have all put forth more than enough effort in order to resolve this situation but it is now out of their hands. I have been in the Army for 4 ? years I have never been in trouble and have been deployed in OIF 1 from March 2003 through March 2004 and currently from July 2006 through July 2007 God willing. My wife and son depend solely on my income because my wife is going to school. Not only is this effecting my pay but it is also effecting my career in the Army if I choose to reenlist by delaying this promotion it delays opportunities to be looked at for other promotions. I was just informed while writing this email that even though I have supporting documents signed by my Company Commander authorizing the reevaluation dated 3 May 06 and it was turned in no later than 15 May 06. They did not turn it in for what ever reason they just turned it in 22 Sep 06 and now I must wait two more months and hope that the promotion points drop less than 510. My unit the 410th MP CO has told me that they will NOT support me in this issue. I know if this were the civilian I could probably have a law suite but not in the Army. All I want is to get this issue fixed the right w ay not for someone to tell me somebody messed up and now I have to suffer when the right thing can still be done. This has effected a lot and has left a horrible taste in my mouth about the way the Army preaches that we could all do the right thing and that if you do the right thing and live the Army values everything should go according to plan well this has not. I do not mean to bother or inconvenience you. I know you have a lot to do but I would appreciate it greatly if you could help me out. I know this is probably going to be frowned upon but I believe I have been through all the proper channels and I have not got an answer or at least not an answer that is Morley right. If you believe this to be the right answer then I will have no other choice than to stand by it and support it. I will not let this effect my job performance or any of the soldiers around me. I am a professional soldier.

Very Respectfully,

Subject:	visa issues

Sir,

 

 

   My name is Nicholas Darwin Yancey; I am a resident of the great state of Florida.   I am currently serving in our nation’s Air Force, as a health services administration journeyman, and am stationed at Kadena AB in Okinawa, Japan. I would like to seek you assistance in a matter dealing with immigration of my family members to the United States. I have submitted an application to the US Consulate, Naha for my wife and step daughter's immigrant visas so they may join my youngest daughter and me upon our relocation to the states. Sir, my wife and stepdaughter are Filipino citizens. I began their visa application process in July of 2006 and have run into a little bit of trouble. Around the first part of July, we submitted part one of the application; shortly thereafter they informed us they had not accepted the documents as my wife was missing some addresses, and my stepdaughter’s birth certificate had an administrative error. We returned to the consulate around the latter part of July. At this encounter they informed us the papers were still incomplete because my wife had not included the correct addresses from her birth until now. After providing the requested information, the consulate staff informed us they would have to contact the Philippine Embassy in Manila, Philippines. They said that it would take six to eight weeks just to hear back from the Philippine Embassy. It has now been 12 weeks, and I still haven't heard anything from the Embassy. Here is where my problem lies. I am scheduled to depart Okinawa on December 9, 2006 for my next assignment in the states.  If I don't hear back from the US Consulate, Naha by the middle of September, I will most likely not have enough time to complete part two of the immigrant visa process. This is because it currently takes between two and four weeks to get a medical exam at the only medical facility, Adventist Clinic, on Okinawa authorized to complete the physical portion of the application. Following this appointment it will take another two to three weeks for the results to be submitted to the consulate staff, then another three to four weeks for the part two appointment at the US Consulate, Naha for her interview. Should they grant the visa at this appointment, the visas would not be issued until around the middle of December, which is beyond my scheduled departure window. With the current travel issues in airports around the world, this would make traveling alone very difficult and intimidating to say the least. Any assistance you could offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

 

 

Here again is where my problem lies Naha said they contacted the United States embassy in manila to do a fraud and marriage index on my wife Melouzina Oliver Yancey formally known as Melouzina Gerfaldo Oliver DOB: 31 Jan 1975   before she got married. And also on my step daughter Ma.Mariane Ashly Oliver DOB 19 NOV 1996. They told me it would take about 6 to 8 weeks to hear back from them, it has been about 11 and a half. I am leaving here in about 7 weeks. Would like to know if there is anything I can do to speed up this process. My contact in Naha is Roskamp, Philip W [RoskampPW@state.gov].    And here is some more info you might find useful.

COMMENTS: To Whom It May Concern,
     My name is Amber Dennis and I am 16 years old. I am sure that you wont help me because nobody else would. But I am still going to ask. Here is my story:
     My grandmother, Betty Arbogast, passed away on July 8th of 2006. My grandfather, James Arbogast, was left with the guardianship that he shared with my grandmother of my 5 cousins. My grandfather retired on August 21st. The day that he turned 65. He is in debt at least $2500 or more that I know of. But please do not quote me on that because I may be wrong. He is in danger of losing his home and my cousins. Because if he loses his home then he will lose them too. He owes $1400 on rent. You should know that it was the Social Security Administration office that put my grandfather in debt. They made mistakes and then did not fix them. They took the money that was owed to my grandmother and they put my grandfathers bank into the red. They have not fixed it yet. My grandfather does not have the benefits to pay ANYTHING. They have a hold of some type on his retirement so he cannot get it yet. I do not know what to do to help my grandfather. He really needs the help. If there is!
  anything that you can do then please PLEASE let me know. In case you would like it my grandfathers phone number is 863*297*5611. this is also the phone number that you can reach me or my mother, Irene Dennis, at if you have anymore questions.

Mr. Bush,
 
I have been a resident of this great state now for about 5 years. My wife and I both live in Pensacola, and think of this area as paradise. However, there is a great injustice taking place here in Pensacola. A good friend of mine is being religiously persecuted by the IRS on a daily basis. I am sure you have heard of Dr. Kent Hovind, and Creation Science Evangelism here in Northwest Florida. The IRS is trying to put this poor man, and his wife, to prison for charges that have no grounds. I beg of you Gov. Bush, please, please help this man and his family. The fact of the matter is that he does not withhold income taxes because the ministry is just that, its a ministry. The people that work there are not employees, they are missionaries. They do not receive a salary or wage, they receive a stipend for their weekly living expenses. If you would, please try and help these people as soon as you can. 
 
Thank you for your Time,
Christopher M. Rudolph

Dear Governor of Florida:

The reason that I’m writing is that my husband( Arben Lubonja with A# 78-730-792) was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on September 20, 2006 and as of today he has being transferred from the prison of Krome, Miami in New Mexico. We are shocked and traumatized from the INS actions because we have applied and filed in time a Petition for Review from the denial of our asylum case with the court of Appeal on or about July 2003 and as of today this appeal remains pending before this court.  

We didn’t expect that happen to our family.  At this moment, I am living with my five year old daughter who was born in US.  She is constantly asking and crying about her dad.  Our attorney also filed an Emergency Motion with the US Court of Appeal and the Motion is still pending in the Court.  We are still waiting; my husband is in jail and my daughter and I are living alone at home.  At this moment, I can’t work and drive because everything is on hold.

I would very much appreciate if you can help release my husband from jail.  I don’t know the name or location of the prison he is right now but I do have the prison’s phone number (505-824-4884).  

We don’t know what else to do, so please, please help me and my daughter. Please let us know if you would like further documents about our case. 

I do not have a computer at my house so please forward all the correspondence via e-mail to my friend at lediametaj@earthlink.net

Dear Governor, 
My name is Joel Leon JR., I have been living in the state of Florida since 1998, I'm writing you this letter because I've used all the options available to me and you are my last chance and my only hope in pursuing my dream to be a Police Officer.

Here's a little more about me, I was born on April, 08, 1981 in the Dominican Republic of Haitian parents. When I was seven years old my parent moved back to Haiti, a couple months before my tenth birthday my father came to New York and a couple years later my mother went to the Bahamas. I was left with my grandmother who passed away a year after I came here. Since I can remember I always wanted to be a Police Officer, I grew up where the Police were the bad guys but I always wanted to be a good Police Officer. In 1998, I came here with the hope I'll be a Police Officer, I studied hard to learn the language and as soon as it was possible took a job in customer service with Publix Supermarkets, I believed this job will help me learn how to deal with the public better and it did. I was never aware that immigration status and I did not know it could stop me from getting my dream job. After working at Publix for three years, I was hired by the Hallandale Beach Police Department as a Community Service Aid which was the right step toward my dream job. The only problems is I was not a citizen and I was misinformed by father on my real status at the time. I learned my real status when I went so see a lawyer in July of this year, Maria Gonzalez, I was not aware of the proper steps to take and how long before I see results until I met Mrs. Gonzalez. 
 
I was granted asylum in 2001 through my mother, I was eligible to apply for adjust status or greencard in 2002 but my father told me I had it already since he came in 1990 which was true but was not valid in 2006. Now, I just applied for adjust status in August and according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) web site as of September 19, 2006, they are now processing the same type of application which they received on August 08, 2003. Now, this mean that I won't receive my greencard until sometime in 2009 or 2010 then I have to wait another five years until I can apply for citizenship that is eight or nine years that I could have been working this job I love. Since I started working as Community Service Aid, I always grab the opportunity to learn more and prepare my self to be an efficient police officer. I also received the award of civilian of the quarter I recently enrolled at the Broward Community College central campus pursuing my criminal justice degree. 

Dear Governor, I'm 25 years old now, I'll be over 30 years olds when I'm eligible to apply to be a Police Officer, Please anything you can do to help me will be greatly appreciate. All I want is a chance to do what I love and as I promise all of those who help get here I will not disappoint you, I will be the best Police Officer I can be. Thank you for your time and attention.

Subject:	Social Security Administration disaster, something must be done!


Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing in hopes that either yourself or someone in your administration will provide a solution to a very horrible situation.  My mother is 64 years of age, after a very long battle that included the most recent appeal, she was recently declared disabled (she was diagnosed with ovarian and breast cancers) and thus was entitled to disability benefits.

Her case no. is [REDACTED].  The ruling occurred sometime at the end of June, 2006.  Aside from her monthly benefits, SSA also was to pay her retroactively (one lump sum approximately $6,000.00) after attorneys fees were paid.  On or about the end of July, 2006, her attorneys were paid their fees from SSA, my mother unfortunately did not receive her monies.  My mother called SSA, who at that time advised her that there had been an error and a check for the amount of $16,000.00 was mistakenly issued to my mother.  The check was never sent out.  SSA advised her that they were "researching" why the error occurred and that a new check in the correct amount would be sent to her.

As you can see, it is now October 12, 2006 and to date she HAS NOT RECEIVED THE CHECK.  My mother is ill and cannot handle much stress, due to her medical status.  This has been causing an enormous amount of stress for her, all unneeded and unnecessary.  She has constantly called the SSA, who has repeatedly given her the same story time and time again, apparently her "check" is still in the SSA's "payables department" and no one can provide her with ANY TIME FRAME WHATSOEVER!!!!  In fact, they tell her that there is no telephone number to that department within the SSA and that the only way the reps at SSA can contact them is through Email transmissions, and the most ironic part of it, is that they have advised my mother that THE MORE THEY EMAIL THE PAYABLES DEPARTMENT, THE FURTHER BACK THE PROCESSING OF HER CHECK WILL BE PUSHED!!!

My mother lives on a very fixed income, she is fragile and does not deserve this constant emotional strain on her.  The SSA has retained monies rightfully due to her, which could have been earning her interest, meager as it may be, it would still contribute largely to her unfortunate status.  There has been no response whatsoever, my mother does not have her check, and this just is not right nor fair, especially to a person that worked all her life for benefits and rights under the constitution that this governmental entity is neglecting from providing to her.

I believe that my mother is entitled to her monies immediately and more so is entitled to interest on the monies to date.  Please, although this is one very small request, it is one that is very important to my family.

My mother's name is Elisa Rodriguez and her contact home phone is 561-968-8261.  Please help us in any way you can, this cannot continue this way.  I can be reached at this email address.  

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thanking you in advance,

Dear Gov. Bush
 
My husband is in the U.S. Army National Guard.  Originally he was based out of Melbourne A-2-264th.  He was injured in Country.  When he came home he was put in to the CBHCO-FL program.  Which is a program for injured Soldiers to allow them to stay on active duty orders and go home to receive their medical attention as long as they were needing more than 6 months of medical treatment.  My husbands medical criteria met this.  
 
He is still in need of medical treatment.  He has had a very uncooperative Case Manager within this program and she has now made it so that he was kicked out of this program by saying he canceled surgeries and did not communicate medical documentation with her.  For these accusations he was kicked out of the CBHCO-FL program and shipped up to Ft. Gordon GA for the continuation of medical treatment/medical eval- med board.  I have documentation proving otherwise.
 
My husbands local doctor believes that there is still more to be done to releive his back pain and because of these false accusations my husband cannot continue his medical plan with his treating doctors because he is at Ft. Gordon, Georgia.  
 
I need help.  I would like to bring this to the public to let them know what is going on with our injured Soldiers and to be able to assist other Soldiers that may be in the same situation as my husband.  
 
I have a 7 page complaint that I have sent to Senator Nelson, Senator Posy and The White House.  The only response I got was from Senator Posey's office stating this is a Federal matter because he is active duty.  I have contacted ABC and got a response yesterday.  They are sending a letter with and anticipated negative response from the CBHCO Office in Orlando.  (A description of the CBHCO is included in the attached complaint.)  That is getting the ball rolling with ABC.  Please contact me regarding this matter. 
 
I am enclosing the complaint that I wrote to give you a fuller picture of what I am trying to do and what is going on with my husband.  I will send the attachments as I do not have them on my computer and they are not up for public until I know there is really something I can do.  My husband, at that point, will share all information necessary to the claim.  
 
Please assist me in getting this matter resolved.  The General public at this point is the only avenue of assistance that we can see, unless you can help us further.    
 
Thank you for you assistance.  
 
Please respond to this

Mr. Bush, 
you are our last resort! My husband Rolando Viera is a baseball player, he used to play with the Red Sox. He most recently played with a Canadian League called Brockton Rox and he got some great numbers, so the Angels are now interested in him, but there is a big problem. My husband came to the United States with a Cuban Visa and has applied for his residency four years ago but yet he still has not received his residency and I can not understand why? We were married on Jan 24th 2006 here in Miami, I was born and raised in the United States but we did not change his application for residency because we were afraid it would prolong the process. My husband did his fingerprints back in September 2004, then again 6 months ago, we had received a letter that he was pre-approved they just needed a police report from Miami Dade and from Trenton New Jersey we gave them what they requested over 4 months ago and still no residency. My husbands dream is to play professional baseball for the United States, he is now 33yrs. old and to be offered another chance to fulfill his lifetime dream is a wonderful opportunity. We need his residency by Feb.1st 2007 or the Angels will not let him go to Spring Training....is there anything you can do????
                                Thank You,

I know I will not get an answer back from you but why is it that we are rolling out the red carpet for these people!! They come into this country and they do not go by the laws they do what ever they want it like the Americans owes them something ever sense they have been coming here the crime is getting worst in South Florida. I know you will be leaving office soon and I hope who ever replaces you will do as good or better to stop the cuban smugglers. Thank You, John L.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush:
 
I am a freshman at Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida.  I am sending an email to you regarding my views on immigration.  Immigration has been a hot topic both on a Federal and State level.  I would like to understand what measures you have taken on immigration during your term as governor.  
 
Immigration has many pros and cons.  My views are against allowing illegal immigrants into the United States.  I feel the borders should be more secure and a Visa or green card should be harder to obtain.  Illegal immigrants are taxing our state and national governments both financially and socially.  Illegal immigrants are not paying their fair share of taxes but expect the services that taxpayers are entitled to.  Also, our education system is being affected by this problem.  Teachers are expected to teach children that have not learned English.  More time is taken with these children and less on those that legally live in Florida.  Also, the issue of security to our borders needs to be addressed so we have a safer state with less crime and less ability for terrorists to invade us.
 
The favor of a reply regarding your views and actions during your term would be appreciated.  Also, do you feel your agenda will be carried on when a new governor is elected next month?
 
With kind regards,
 
Michael Pitt

Hello, Governor Bush,
My name is Lourdes Pintado. I took the citizenship test three months ago and I passed it. However, they have not sent me the citation to oath because they are waiting for my background check from Cuba. They told me on my second visit to the office of Homeland Security that there were two thousand other people in the same case and that I needed to wait. They also warned me not to go back to the office until four months have passed. They even advice me to contact the governor and the senators if I wanted anything done in my behalf. I don't really know how this works, but I don't loose anything trying. I will appreciate your help in this matter.

Dear Governor Bush,

As Veterans Day approaches, I am reminded of the extreme sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. These brave people have answered the call to duty to protect our nation and to defend our way of life. Over 1 million troops have served in the current "war on terror" and more than 20,000 of them have been injured in the line of duty.

Their sacrifice should be rewarded with the care, respect, and honor they have earned. Yet, Congress recently tried to slash the budget for the VA's traumatic brain injury care and research centers which many of our wounded troops are counting on. Worse yet, the Department of Veterans Affairs which handles healthcare and benefits for our returned soldiers currently has a backlog of more than 800,000 claims and cases pending with no plan to reduce it. Those 800,000 cases represent real people -- veterans who've served our country and their families -- who need our help and are not getting it.

I call on you to honor the extreme sacrifices of our veterans by fully funding veterans' healthcare and benefits. It is the least we can do to thank them for everything they do for us and for our country.

 

 

 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor,

My name is Thomas Bonner.  I am an engineer working for NASA at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  I am married to a Russian woman with permanent resident status, Irina Semenovskaya Bonner, and we are trying to help get a non-immigrant tourist visa for Irina’s mother, Galina Semenovskaya, who resides in Yaroslavl.  Galina wants to come to our home in Florida for a one or two month visit.  Galina has had three visa requests denied.  Her last interview was at the U.S. embassy in Moscow on October 10, 2006 at 10:00.  Galina followed all procedures correctly in the application process including a letter of invitation written by me explaining the entire situation and more than adequate supporting documentation.  I don’t know the name of the interviewer but I believe he should be reprimanded for his humiliating treatment and total lack of respect for Galina during the interview.  The interviewer refused to look at any supporting documents and told Galina he felt she had intensions of illegally immigrating to the United States and that she has no chance of ever obtaining a tourist visa.  He also told Galina that my marriage to her daughter was falsified despite having a copy of our marriage certificate.  I am really very confused and angry by her treatment during the interview and I don’t understand why she was denied a visa.  Galina has no intensions whatsoever of immigrating to the United States.  Galina has no criminal record, she has a son and daughter and two grand children living in Yaroslavl.  Galina also owns an apartment in Yaroslavl and loves living in her homeland.  Galina wants only to visit her daughter and see her six year old grandson (whom she has never met) and her two granddaughters.  Irina and I are paying for her flights to and from Russia and she will be staying in our home.  She will be staying for no longer than two months and flying back to Yaroslavl, this my personal guarantee.  

 

Governor Bush, can you please look into this matter and get back to me with some kind of explanation and possibly a resolution?

 

Thank you,

Dear Governor,

        My name is domingo perezcajina I have lived in this country for many year's.  The reason for this letter is to let you know how I feel. I have been in the military
for 8 year's. I got out and I got with two good conduct's so I served this country very well. Unfurtunate event's happens in life .My mom is sick and I don't how much longer she has to live . I have been away from home and I'm here to stay and I'm trying to start all over .I want someone to find out or help me out to resolve this matter first and formost I went to talk to someone in Immigration and I was unable to see someone. Since I got out neither my command that I was sattioned or immigration know weres my paperwork .They did a backround check to get secret clearance .Because i work on safe that pilot's use to put there top secret and secret information and now that I'm out and try to find how to get my paper that say's that I'm a citizen. No one know's and I'm try to get a job and I can't because of that . I need to take of my mom and I'm wasted 10 day's in trying an answer.

Dear Gov. Bush,

 

I am sure you are not the one to receive this e-mail however I will still address it to you.  I have written in the past about my disability claim filled with the state.  I originally filled in 10/2004.  I have been through the appeals process and currently have been waiting for a court date for over a year now.  This process is not only mentally straining but physically.  I have tried to contact the office to find out the status of my case and they have refused to provide me with information.  I have sent letters to update them on my current health and family status (still have not worked since 10/2004, gone to all appointments, for over a year I have been seeing mental health specialist; diagnosed with major depression and sever anxiety, my father committed suicide last September)  that is just to state a few.  This whole process continues to take a toll on my self as well as my family.  I have health insurance however the co-pays are costly.  My husband is trying to support me and two children with health needs as well on his salary as a deputy.  I have met people that received disability on the first try but are not even sick nor have they worked.  The system is failing.  I have pleaded with your office via e-mail and letters, my local representatives, social security, and others.  I am getting no where except further in debt wit h no resolution.  I have worked more than 10 years in public service but get nothing in return.  I asked how the state can say I can still work in the capacity of a police officer yet they revoked my certification due to health and syncope on the job.  They acknowledge limitations in my physical abilities yet say I can perform a job in the hospital as a tech.  Prior to leaving my position at the hospital I was doing as minimal as possible.  I was denied access to the nursing program due to physical limitations.  I was advised to resign from the hospital due to not being able to perform my job, missed work, and a liability to the employer.  I do not know where to go from here.  I have an Attorney that was suggested by Social Security but have not received any answers from them either.  Please I am pleading with your staff to offer any assistance possible to help me resolve this.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Estimadisimo Señor Gobernador Jeb Bush,
 
El motivo de mi carta es una peticion. A mi esposo Elmo, ciudadano americano de 55 años de edad, se le ha diagnosticado cancer en el cerebro, el tiene un hijo de 23 años en Cuba, Elmo Junior, al que ya hace ocho años que no ve y debido a su condicion tememos que no puedan reunirse otra vez. 
Yo no tengo mas familia aqui que a mi esposo, vamos a cumplir a fianles de Octubre 20 años de casados, toda mi familia vive en Cuba. Tuve que dejar mi trabajo en la Biblioteca porque hay que llevarlo todos los dias al hospital para la Radio Terapia y necesita asistencia en la casa.
Hay alguna posibilidad de que usted me pueda ayudar a que se reunan ellos dos antes de que sea tarde?
Mi esposo y yo estamos caminando en Fe, sabemos que Dios puede hacer milagros y creemos en su palabra.
Le estamos pidiendo tambien a usted que generosamente nos ayude o nos oriente que podriamos hacer.
 
Mis disculpas por escribirle en español pero se de su habilidad para los idiomas y para mi verdaderamente en este momento en que estoy viviendo me es muy dificil escribir ni pensar, aun en mi propia lengua.
 
 
Muchas Gracias.
 
Que Dios lo continue bendiciendo.

Governor 

It is unthinkable that last year my flood insurance was around $340.00 and this year is approximately $3500.00 dollars an increase of over 900%. Maybe for you who adjusts your pay accordingly it would be fine, but for me which I work for a living, represents my having to sell my house after working so hard and paying taxes. There is going to be two types of people in the USA the ones displaced by Katrina, and the ones displaces by flood insurance which would you like to be remembered by? I do not request an explanation, I demand it for you work for the better of all of the people of the state of Florida. UN-ACCEPTABLE.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a U.S. citizen residing at 422 Kings Court, Akron, Ohio 44321.
I am married to a Canadian who owns a home at 18 Olde Forest Lane,
Bobcaygeon, Ontario Canada KOM 1AO and also owns a home at 15455 
Crystal Lake Dr.. North Frt. Myers ,Florida 33917
Frank C. DeGoey has an IRS # ITIN [REDACTED]
 
We attempted to cross the boarder into the U.S. in Sept. for my 50 th
class reunion and my husband was turned back.
    1. They assumed that he was moving in with me and asked me that 
         question several times and I assured them he had his own property 
         in Canada and also Florida.
 
    2.  Something came up on their computer  regarding an offense committed 
          in New  Jersey.
    3.  Something else (they didn't know what) about Orillia,Ontario in
          1962, where he had never been.  Was married at that time with
         a one year old son.
 
WE have the documents proving that NO OFFENSE was committed
and are available at your request.  We tried explaining and showing
the boarder patrol these but they were not listening and we were
not treated very politely.
 
My husband is 69 years old with two heart bypasses and his doctor
feels that the warm weather is better for his condition.
 
We spend the winters in N. Ft. Myers, contribute  to the economy, volunteer 
at the schools and hospitals.
 
I have three daughters in Ohio; 2 in Columbus and one in Akron.
 
We hope you can help resolve this situation so we can travel without
a stressful hassle in the future
 
.Please let us know if you need additional information.
 
Waiting for your reply and will be most grateful for your assistance.

Mr. Bush,
My brother is on Social Security disability and is waiting for the retroactive check that they owe him. He received a form to fill out and it stated that after they received it he would receive his money immediately. That was five months ago. His old car is falling apart and he is afraid to drive it anywhere because he is afraid of getting stranded and because his back is so bad he could not walk to get help or to a phone. He has been waiting on this check to buy a dependable car so he can go to the doctor for some treatments on his back to help with the pain and to run everyday errands. When he calls about the check he gets all kind of different answers. The one lady told him there wasn't any reason he shouldn't have his check by now that two people had to sign off on it and she would call them and have one of them get in touch with him. Of course that didn't happen. The next time he called this lady told him that no they do not call anyone. You get the idea. Can anything be done so he can get the check immediately like they told him?
My brothers name: Richard Louis French, 10710 Golfview Dr, Pembroke Pines, Fl 33026

I want to know. How does one go about to get a legal holiday , that I have an idea for? I am Native American. I was wanting to have a day in the calendar year set aside just for , "NATIVE AMERICAN DAY", like Martin Luther King Day? Am I just wishing for this, or,can it happen?

I've been trying to get medicare parts A and B since Feb. 2006, yet every time I call the 800 number or my local social security office I get the run around. They deducted seven months of premiums out of my Sept. 2006 disability check, but yet I have no service. The last time I spoke with my local social security office was on Oct. 5,2006 they said every thing was taken care of, but yet when my doctors office tries to process a claim it can't be done. Also when I spoke with social security for last time they said they would send me a letter confirming this information, but when I received this letter it had two more claim numbers for processing claims. The claim numbers they gave me are my social security number with the letters HA, A and DI, but they still don't tell me what number to use and my doctors still can't process any claims. I also can't get my medicare part D so I have no coverage what so ever, could you please help me or tell me what to do .

I had an interesting conversation with a lady of Hispanic origin last week.  She told me that she planned to come down to St. Mary's Hospital and get a job in Admissions (where I work).  When I pointed out that we didn't have any openings she advised me that "soon" current employees will have to be fired so they can hire bi-lingual employees.  According to this lady, the Spanish speaking people of the US are going to demand that all public facilities - like hospitals, courthouses, etc. - be staffed by people who read, speak and comprehend Spanish. 
 
Incase you are not aware of it, some public schools in the New York area have already been designated "bilingual" and have already laid off teachers with seniority in order to hire new Spanish speaking (licensed bilingual) teachers.  
If you and your children intend to survive in your country (USA) you will have to become fluent in Spanish or risk the consequences.
 
We hear about the silent majority but I think we are going to have to speak up or find ourselves a conquered country.  That would be an interesting historical note - greatest land in the world conquered by Mexico without ever firing a shot!  Think about it. 

1. Pass the law now pending to make English the ONLY official language of the United States of America. 

2. Petition to Require citizenship to be eligible for social services in the United States. 

3. No amnesty and No free services for illegal immigrants. 

4. Vote in English only, and Drivers test in English only.
Do we want to wind up like Canada where EVERYTHING has to be written in 2 languages?

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I've been receiving your informative newsletter for a few years now and have followed your family's politcal career since your father was Vice President.  I've listened to the liberals petty gripes and complaints about your father and now the current President Bush.
 
It would seem to me that we need more good words for our President and I've written a poem for President Bush.  I hope you see this personally and will send it to the President with my best wishes.  I believe that he is often so busy saving the world that he has little time to see everything that comes to the White House.  Please see that he gets this Poem I've written especially for him.  I hope to see it on Fox News as well.  If you don't send it to them I will.  Have a nice day.
 
Thank you

Deep in the heart of America stands a man
He's for all the people an' does more than any man can
 
He sacrifices all of himself to do what is right
And after the terrorist attack he took it to their homeland to fight
 
There are some that condemn an' say he's wrong
But true Americans stand with him singing a Freedom Song
 
Most of us know that President Bush is on the right track
Fighting for freedom an' liberty for all we can never turn back
 
So on with you Hugo Chavez and the U.N.
Rant an' Rave you cowardly foes for with you the devil has always been
 
In the end America an' her allies will win
An' the terrorists they'll cry out in pain as they fall to the depths of their sin
 
With this chosen land of liberty making the world all free
An' George Bush standin' tall an' proud seein' all nations a better place to be
 
Like his father before him there's no back up in George Bush's bones
He keeps his word even when liberals continue to cast their evil stones
 
And when this terrible war is over an' done now
America standin' proud with a bright new star upon her brow
 
So let some of the world and even some of our own put us down
In the end George W. Bush and heaven's glorious trumpet will sound
 
Like much of the past the bad people of the world have had their say
In the end it's always the same and America with divine liberty wins out the day

Mr. Bush, We are in great need of your help and anyone who can direct us and help us through this process. My Boyfriend is unable to work and has applied for social security disability and ssi. He has been unable to work for 4 years and we seem no closer to getting his disibility than we were before we really hope you may be able to help. Fred is dibetic in an overall period of times its is controlled but on a daily basis is not, he also has parkinsons systems and is on med for this, Fred has knee braces and a cane to help with walking. He is unable to shower unless I am home He falls and has problems holding onto things he also shakes in his sleep, he has high blood pressure, He has Nerophathy in his hands and feet and cronic neck and back pain and he also suffer from depression. We had his case in the hands of GK Jointer and associates and did not realise they were non-lawers untill He had seen a Judge and was turned down the judge said he was unrealiable of course freds Dr said sure he does not remember dates or time of things, fred is also dixelic he obtained a highschool special diplomia when in school by leasining to tapes and learned the trade mechinic in school. The Dr seems to feel that because he is only 38 is why it is taking so long he used as an example michial j fox being the same age but being forunate enough not to have  money problems. Freds Dr is a phisyons assistant, He has been the only Dr that takes the time to talk to us and explain freds problems and seems to be the only careing Dr. He has told us,  Fred would be a danger to himself or an employer to work. Fred has been out of work for 4 years now I am the sole supporter of 4 on an income of 1,200.00 a month we have been together for almost 7 years and not only does Fred wish he could work, but if he could I cerentially would not be the only one working. Even if we could get anykind of help at all would be a great help, We now have the appeal case and a new case started with Disparti Law Group, P.A. witch was once Ward White and Associates. Please Help anything that would help this process would be greately appreachated.

I am a british citizen currently living in Florida.
On Thursday of last week my mother tragically died from choking in my fathers arms in England.
We moved here five and a half years ago on a E2 Visa, we are now here on an I94 two year extension which I am reliably informed by numerous phone calls over the last few days that we are unable to return unless we fully apply for a new Visa which can take up to seven months.
We run a business here and both our children are in public School so this is not a viable option!
What we are seeking is a stay to leave the country for up to two weeks to attend the funeral and support relatives and gain some closure.We are not looking to extend anything or have any more rights on our return than we have now if our I 94 card can be renewed to our last entry would be enough, not from the new date so we would be here on exactly the same situation apart from being able to attend the funeralWe feel we have been a benefit to the American society and have made many friends who are appalled by our situation.
Can you help?

Dear Governor Bush,
I am a 46 year old woman that has been sick for the past six years. I cant not work at this time, due to the following illnesses:
diabetes
HBP
chronic fatigue
severe anemia
SOB
chest pains
Chronic back pain
I have a small mass in my throat that needs to be removed
I am having outpatient surgery this week @ the Parkside Surgery Center.
I have stomach problem from iron taken by mouth for 3 plus years.
I am in need of a blood transfusion, become after having iron infusions for almost six years, in July of this year I almost went into shock after my treatment.  I have vision problems  again, since the treatment problem in July.
 I cannot longer use iv-iron.
 
 
 
I applied several years ago for disability assistance, and was turned down.
 
Please explain to me how it is that a person as myself that has worked almost her entire life cannot get assistance, after paying taxes all those years, and a drug dealer who has never worked a honest days work his whole life can get shot doing a drug deal and walk out the hospital with a check, or a immigrant can comes to this country brings his entire family and get aid that he/she has never had to contribute too.
Welfare mothers can get assistance for eighteen years and never have to pay for anything, just keep having babies
 
I have had to do without meds that my physicians didn't carry samples of, I have missed out on so much because for about four years I could drive, but wasn't issued transportation assistance not even to keep my appointments.
 
When my youngest son Bryan, who is now in Brhang, was graduating from boot camp, I almost could not attend, we had to borrow money for the second ticket and hotel.  That is not the your life should be when you have worked so long without collecting from the government on a regular basis.
 
I have several surgeries I need, but we simply cant afford it.  
 
I guess its hard to truly understand the problems of people of lessor means than yourself!
 
I don't know where to turn, how do working people get help when they can no longer work?
The amount of assistance I would get could make a big difference in my day to day life/living.  It wont make me rich.
 
My husband Thomas has been working for Jacksonville Port Authority for over twenty years ever since leaving the navy, and now he has to consider rather or not he can stay with Jax Port, because we need additional income.  It's not fair,  I am such burden on my family and have no where to turn, so I am turning to you.
Please help.
Thank you in advance.

DEAR JEB BUSH,
       I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF MY NEIGHBOR ROBERT DUNN. HE IS IN OUR COUNTRY ON A VISA
FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 YEARS. HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET A GREEN CARD FOR HIMSELF AND 
HIS WIFE AND HAS BEEN TOLD IT MAY BE AN ADDITIONAL 6 YEARS BEFORE THAT WILL HAPPEN.
ROBERT IS A TEACHER AND IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWTH AND EDUCATION OF OUR
CHILDREN. HIS WIFE IS NOT ALLOWED TO WORK DUE TO STATUS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY, SO 
SHE IS A STAY AT HOME MOM AND TAKES CARE OF THEIR 4 YEAR OLD SON WHEN HE IS NOT AT 
DAYCARE. THEIR SON WAS BORN HERE IN OUR COUNTY BUT IT SEEMS HE MAY BE FORCED TO LIVE
IN ANOTHER COUNTY IF SOMETHING CAN'T BE DONE TO HELP HIS PARENTS. 
 
LIKE MOST FLORIDIANS ROBERT IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE RISING COSTS OF HOMEOWNERS AND 
FLOOD INSURANCE. HE ALSO IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH RISING TAXES HERE IN HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY.
UNLIKE MOST OF US ROBERT CAN NOT FILE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION ON HIS HOME DUE TO HIS
STATUS IN OUR COUNTRY. I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS DOES TO HIS PROPERTY TAXES EVERY YEAR.
THIS PUTS A BIG STRAIN ON A SINGLE INCOME FAMILY, SO MUCH THAT THE DUNN FAMILY MAY 
NEED TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY. I LIVE IN A HOME THAT IS WORTH TWO TIMES MORE THAN ROBERT'S AND IS
ALMOST TWICE AS BIG AND YET HIS TAXES ARE OVER $1000 MORE THAT MINE. FROM WHAT I CAN
SEE THE TAXES ON HIS SMALL HOME WENT FROM $342 WHEN THE PREVIOUS OWNER LIVED 
THERE ONLY 18 MONTHS AGO TO THE $2700 THAT ARE DUE THIS YEAR AND WILL CONTINUE
TO RISE DRAMATICALLY WITHOUT THE EXEMPTION. IF ROBERT AND HIS WIFE WERE ABLE TO GET                                                                    A GREEN CARD THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MORE TO INCREASE THEIR INCOME. FLORIDA HAS A
SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO LOSE ANOTHER ONE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT IF ROBERT WAS A FARM WORKER OR WAS IN OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY HIS APPLICATION FOR
A GREEN WOULD BE MOST LIKELY APPROVED BY NOW BUT AS A TEACHER IT TAKES LONGER AND AS TIMES
HAVE CHANGED SO HAVE THE RULES.
 
ROBERT AND HIS FAMILY ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND BELIEVE ME AS DEPUTY IN OUR JAIL SYSTEM I AM A PRETTY
GOOD JUDGE OF PEOPLE. AS HIS NEIGHBOR I CAN TELL YOU THAT ROBERT IS ONLY TRYING TO DO WHAT HIS
BEST FOR HIS FAMILY'S FUTURE AND HE DESERVES A CHANCE TO DO IT. CAN YOU PLEASE TRY TO HELP
THEM WITH THIS ISSUE, AT LEAST DO IT FOR THEIR SON WHO IS A CITIZEN AND DESERVES THE SAME 
OPPORTUNITIES AS EVERY OTHER YOUNG AMERICAN GROWING UP IN OUR COUNTRY.

My name  is  Anna Brahatcek and  for the past couple of months I have been trying to help my father-in-law,  Raymond Thomas James Sr. with receiving social security.  He has been denied many times and has also been  trying for the past 30 years to receive some kind of pension.  He was in Vietnam and was wounded while in active duty. He was treated and released overseas and ever since has been disabled. He has tried to get  copies of his medical records but they are saying that they lost them, however a couple of months ago he received his  bronze star. Social Security is saying that  he has not worked enough years to receive this benefit and we need help with this matter. I will contact the media and do what I need to get the word out about this. Any Vet who has this much trouble trying to receive what is rightfully theirs is  ridiculous. Please any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Dear Family and Friends,

I am trying desperately to get Iron (Venofer, Ferritin, Ferrlicit) treatment drugs put back on the Medicare program.   I don't know how or why it was taken off but I am making a plea to everyone I know to help me.  This is not just for me but for other patients as well.
 
I'm not doing too well.     Two weeks ago, I got a call from Oncology/Hematology Dr. and Doctors Hospital that Medicare is no longer paying for Iron treatments.   What a mess!!    I need to the Iron Infusion to exist.  I have been on phone with Medicare, the hospitals (both Doctors and Sarasota Memorial Hospital) - I was sent to both hospital but Medicare isn't paying (it was cut from program).    This is all new to me and everyone.  Medicare says you have to End Stage Renal Disease AND Anemia.   While I have a kidney that produces kidney stones and I pass kidney stones daily, I do not have End Stage Renal Disease.  It makes no sense - Oncology/Hematology Dr., Nurses and others say it makes no sense.   Medicare has been paying for my treatments the last six years.   I did not have this problem until they signed me up for Medicare Part D.
I have contacted the drug manufacturer.  I've been told I have to write/call my Congress person.  I've done that - I even went to the office (Friday, Oct. 6, 2006) and stood in front of them so they know I am a real person and not just a case number.     I told them I'm not just fighting to get this Iron put back on the Bill but it is for other patients as well.   I'm not strong like that anymore, I'm wore out and in pain.   We shall see what happens.   In the meantime, I can't get Iron treatments which I need to exist.  My problems (kidney stones, Anemia) stem from Post Gastrectomy (my stomach stopped functioning so it had to removed).   I have had 44 surgeries and been through hell and back.   
Plus, I had a CT Scan and it shows I have fracture in my spine.   My Dr. called us into the office to tell me/us.  I'm in a lot of pain daily and weak.  
 
With all the negative TV Ads - why don't they (politicians) turn that negative into a positive and help where help is needed (people trying to exist/severe/critical illnesses).    I do not like those negative TV Ads!
 
I'm at a loss here and asking for help, I don't know what else to do to get this IRON put back on the Bill.   I ask that you email or write my Congress person (Kathryn Harris) and my Governor to PLEASE put Iron treatments back on the Bill.    This is dire call for help, not just for me but other oncology/hematology patients, renal patients, etc.    I thank you from the bottom of heart for any help.  
 
I would like to say, when I went to Nancy Detert (Florida State Representative), her assistant (Christy) was extremely helpful.    Unlike when I originally called Kathryn Harris' office, I got the put off with "Oh" someone will call you back (rude like).   I wasn't asking for a handout...I'm asking for IRON treatments to be put back on the Bill and Medicare pay to for it again.
I'm Deb and I APPROVED this message (isn't that what the government ads always say) LOL  :)

Subject:	RENEWAL OF MY ALIEN REGISTRATION CARD

Importance:	High

Sir:  I have a complaint to make.  Early in the month of May, 2006 I made an appointment on line to go over to the Homeland Security Office, Tradeport, Orlando, Florida to get my Alien Registration Card renewed (it was expiring on September 24, 2006) and I knew at that time that I was going to visit my aging relatives in Wales in the month of September.
 
Upon arriving at the office, I spoke with a very nice lady in the office and she explained that they no longer renew the Alien Registration cards at that office but that I can do this on line.  Coming back to the office I completed all the necessary forms - and completed the data on how to pay on line for this renewal ($260.00) from my Debit Card.  Within a couple of days, my debit card showed the withdrawal of these monies (middle of the month of May) and then waited and waited.  I emailed a request for a response because I wanted to get my card renewed prior to my leaving the States (September 6-22) and all I received in the mail was a certificate acknowledging receipt of the monies: 
 
I recently filed - on-line - my application for renewal of my Green Card - Alien #A-[REDACTED] - and did receive a receipt - MSC-06-801-84068
 
I waited and waited and waited, I sent one email after another and no reply.  I did a certified mail with return receipt to Los Angeles, got the green card back with a signature - but still nothing.  I had to leave on September 6th, 2006 without my card being renewed.
 
Upon my return I did receive a response - a letter stating to report on the date attached on another letter.  It gave me the information on the times etc. and then someone had scratched out the date and whited it out with Liquid Paper and in big writing stated FULL - a lot of good that did me.  I'm now stuck here waiting to hear, I cannot go on a cruise or leave the country because I do not have my card renewed.  But here is the other part of this story.
 
I was going to Wales because I had two relatives that were getting on in age, and a brother that was in ill health.  A couple of days before I left I received a call from my sister in law to let me know that my brother - James McKinty - had a stroke and was in the hospital but that when he was out he would have to rest in bed.  My brother was in a medically induced coma upon my arrival and sad to say he had another catastrophic stroke and they removed the breathing tube on Saturday, September 18th, 2006.  His funeral was set for Monday, September 25th - and yes - you can see what I'm getting to - I could not stay for the funeral because my card expired on the 24th, so I had to stick with my reservation.  Nevertheless I was devastated, relatives that I was unable to see during my vacation came from all over to James funeral and I could not attend.  So Sad, you do not know how bad I feel that my family was not there to see me pay my last respects to the last of my immediate family.  I'm the only one left.
 
Please can you look into why it takes so long to get my card renewed.  I have been in this country since 1961 and always have been able to get this done immediately.  It did state in the latest communiqué that it would take 4-6 months but why after all my communications did I not even get the courtesy of a reply.  Shameful.  It is no over 5 months - my money was taken fast enough.  Looking forward to a reply from you. Thanks

Subject:	Urgent Plea for Assistance

On Thursday October 5, 2006 my neighbor's mother choked to death at her home in England.  This sorrowful situation is tragically compounded by a visa snafu.  My neighbor, Martin Beddow, holds a visa which does not guarantee him reentry to the United States if he leaves to attend his mother's funeral.

While coping with his sorrow and grief, Mr. Beddow has been feverishly trying to find the correct information and a solution - how to obtain the proper credentials to enable him to leave the United States for a short period to attend his mother's funeral, express his grief, and find closure.

As his neighbor and friend and an American citizen, I am appalled and outraged that this situation is proving so difficult to resolve.  Time is of the essence and is exacerbated by the Columbus holiday which deprives Martin and his family of yet one more day in their quest for help.   The poor woman is to be buried this coming week and the Beddow family is still searching for answers and assistance.

These are wonderful people who have been an asset to our country during the five years they have lived in the United States.  Their two children attend school here, and they unstintingly contribute their talents, time and effort to our community of Oyster Bay, Vero Beach, Florida.

I cannot accept that there is nothing to be done to help these fine people.  They are assets, not liabilities.  All they need is a waiver that would allow them to leave for a short period to attend the funeral and return again to the United States.  I am certain that someone possesses the authority and power to circumvent the normal procedures, which take too long, and help them.  I realize that there is a protocol involved but the time contraints are onerous.

On their behalf I am sending this to petition your aid.  Compassion and humanity dictate this circumstance be addreessed immediately and favorably.  Please instigate a judicious intervention and help Martin and his family attend his mother's funeral and find closure.  I thank you in advance for your anticipated assistance.

Dear Mr. Bush,  just want to start by saying, i admire you very much.  you were our rock during the hurricanes two years ago.  charley, francis, etc. the real reason i am emailing you is to tell you my situation, as briefly as possible. 
In Jan. 05 i had a total hip replacement.  my hip had been bad for many years, so even after getting the surgery, i still now need back surgery from heniated discs.  i also have degenerative disc disease. spinal stinosis, and arthritis in lower back.  also muscle atrophy in that right hip.  i remain on a cane.  i do rehab and swim daily, but physical therapist and doctors are not optimistic about my prognosis.  i also have some degeneration and arthritis in neck.  i remain in constant pain and my life can be pretty miserable.  the thing is i have been denied disability insurance twice and had to retain a lawyer.  we are still waiting for a hearing date. it will be over two years since the surgery by the time our hearing date is set. my major problem with all of this, is that i worked from fifteen years old until forty two, the year of my surgery. i also served in the naval reserves.  i never missed one year of work,  i have the credits to receive disabilty, and i think it is a crying shame that people like me have to go through this.  i have been living on the equity of my home, but this loan must be paid back. I'm scared all the time and have depression and anxiety from all of this.  the doctors call it situational depression. i am involved with vocational rehab and abilities of florida, but because of pain and driving issues, it is hard for them to find work for me.  the best thing would be to work from home. i look all the time on the computer, as does my counselor, but i keep finding scams that want money up front.  
my point is, it shouldn't be this way for someone who is truly handicapped.  i have a mini farm with a few goats, a horse, cat, dog, etc, and believe me if i could work i would be there.  most of my anxiety comes from the fear of having to move inland to a place i can afford, and i don't have it in me physically to make a move like that.  my lawyer tells me my age is working against me. i am 44.  it is not my fault that things ended up this way for me at this age.  i'm sure there is nothing you can really do for me, but i do believe you will definately be president in the near future, so please don't forget about people like me out there.  i also realize there are many people who try to scam our system, but there must be something we can do to improve disability insurance.   i also have no insurance because my job did have to let me go when i could not return to work.  so i'm not even able to see any docors anymore. thank you for reading this email, i'm sorry it is long, but i just wanted you to see a point of view from a regular woman who happens to be disabled.    thank you again sincerely,  margaret cicolello

Dear Mr Bush,
 
My name is Maryann Wallimann Mascareñas. I am writing to you out of desperation. You helped me once before about 5 years ago, with Child Support reinforcement- Thank You. Now , I am having issues with Social Security.  My son, Dakota M Luchtman DOB 5/31/94 , his father finally was approved earlier this year for SS Disability. His father's name is Daniel E Luchtman DOB 2/21/69. My application for benefits were finally 'submitted' on 8/5/2006. (it would have been submitted on 6/20/2006 had the ss rep not 'lied' about Daniel being 'declined'). 
    She said quite possibly the decision from Baltimore was not updated yet; one week later got a letter telling me how to reapply.  In July my son gets a letter telling him he was declined because I did not keep my appointment in JUNE. (which I did because I was IN the bathroom when the lady called me and I had the call on speaker with my mom)  SO , I call again, to schedule a callback and submit application finally on 08/05/2006. (with Ms Simmons in St Augustine office) I was told I would have Dakota's back payment for approximately $4700, in 2 Days. (which sounded ridiculous). I called back 10 days later and was told it is on hold, ( I was told by Ms Alvarez that Dakota's monies were on hold because his sister was getting paid) Ms Alvarez said to try in another week, I waited 2.  No one can tell me why the monies are on hold.
However, My son's half sister's mother, Anita Bliss tells me Social Security said that she has to pay her monies back due to Daniel having  recieved payments since January 2003. He was incarcerated 9/04.  I have not recieved any monies and he was just approved in approximately May of this year.  Help! I consider this to be an urgent Matter and NO ONE will tell me why My son's monies are on hold.  No Social Security beneftis have now or ever been issued to me on my son's behalf.
HELP!

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I write as a concerned United Kingdom citizen who is a home owner in Kissimmee, Florida.

 

We have owned a short-term rental home in Florida for over 12 years and even in the awful aftermath of 9/11 found that we could rent our home easily. However, with the continuing problems with US Immigration this is becoming more and more difficult.

 

Many of our regular renters from the UK are refusing to come to the US as they feel that they are being treated so badly at Immigration. I may say that I do agree as the change in the attitude of many of the Immigration Officers is totally shocking. As one of my regulars said to me ‘we are being treated like shit now. 

 

Those of who are doing our best to keep the tourists coming to Florida are despairing. It will not be the end of the world for us if we have to sell our home, we bought when prices were low and even in these difficult times we would see a large profit. We can then take our money home and buy in Europe where we at least would be welcome. The point is that we do not want to do that. Many of us have spent a great deal of money in promoting tourism in Florida and we love Florida but if things continue as they are we will have no option but to sell up.

 

This should be a great time for tourism in Florida, with the British Pound strong against the US Dollar, the British should be keen to come to Florida and the rest of the US, but that is not the case. The latest suggestion that people would have to obtain a Visa, rather than use the Visa Waiver Programme is also a consideration. It would add a considerable amount to a holiday if a family had to pay the cost of Visas and also if they live outwith the London area there is also the cost of travelling there to obtain their Visas and probably overnight accommodation. This would definitely keep all but the most fervent tourist out of the US.

 

Immigration is not the only problem that we are facing; we are now being treated as second class in the Local Tax applications. This does not just affect those of us from the UK; it also affects short-term rental owners from parts of the US too. Osceola County has just approved a huge increase in taxes and of course those of us who are non-residents fare worse than local residents.

 

You must realise that it is the tourists that we short-term rental owners bring in that put the most into the economy, without the tourists the County would really have problems. Who spends the money in local stores and amusement parks? It is certainly not the locals. 

 

We are now also being penalised after all these years of having Florida Driving Licenses in that we have to re-apply each time we come rather than being allowed to renew as in the past.  I am well aware of all the security implications, but surely with a track record in the State and with all the modern technology available it should surely be possible for us to be security vetted and once you are satisfied with our clearance, be allowed to renew our licenses as in the past. This cost us more to insure our cars if we don’t have a Florida License and also causes problems when using checks in stores without valid ID.

 

I hope that you will look closely at the facts that I have provided. I am a member of our local sub-division’s web-site where most of us short-term rental owners share information and can assure you that many owners have become very unhappy to the extent that several have already put their homes on the market. I may say that they are attempting to ensure that they are purchased by local residents rather than short-term rental owners as they feel that they do not want to be seen to be putting any more money into the tourist trade in Florida. I find this very upsetting and I am sure that you too will feel that this is not what Florida wants. But what are you doing about it? Do you want tourists or is America just shutting its doors to tourists. That is certainly what many of are beginning to feel. I hope that this is not what you want and I am pretty sure it isn’t but it is what us so called ‘Aliens’ are feeling right now.

 

I have relatives who have been in the US since the General Strike in Britain in 1926 and they were made welcome in the ‘land of the free’ it is a pity if that was not still the way America wants it to be. 

 

I may say that many of my American friends fully agree with me and say that they are ashamed of the way their country is treating us, as they say, ‘particularly our friends in the UK.’

 

I look forward to hearing your views on this email and would be very glad to meet with you and discuss my feelings if that was at all possible. Or perhaps the local Senator for our area of Florida would like to meet with us. I could probably arrange for several other owners in our area to meet with him or her. We will be in Florida between November 1st and December 13th of this year.

 

Yours faithfully,

Dear Governor Bush:

We are among the more than 2000 homeowners within the Coastal Barrier Resource System who can no longer purchase private flood insurance for our homes. As a result, our financial security is in great jeopardy. We formally request that possible solutions to this critical situation be addressed at the anticipated special session of the Florida State legislature. Thank you, in advance, for helping us mitigate this potentially disastrous situation.

This is my second mailing to you on this subject.  I complied with your (staffs) suggestion to alert the federal representation since it is a federal law.  They, of course, immediately dropped the suggestion to ammend or remove the current outdated legislation because it is "imbedded in concrete".  We all know that the only thing that our federal legislators can do is "agree" to vote themselves a pay raise................

Please help us?

Subject:	I don't have a Congressman

Dear Governor Bush
 
    I am a Republican from Stuart.  I might normally address this e-mail to my congressman, but as you know I don't have one at this time.  I hope that you can talk to President Bush about my idea--a proposal to greatly expand his energy program, and to turn the nation's attention away from Mark Foley at a critical time.  This proposal will:
 
    a. Turn around the mid-term election
    b. Show America the way toward energy independence
    c. Usurp the Democrats on the environment
    d. Change the subject of national attention away from Mark Foley
    e. Result in a new label for the president by the mainstream media: the new George
        Bush!
 
   This idea is a synthesis of 2 issues:
 
    1. As Dick Morris has said regarding the current political environment, President Bush has the power to "change the subject," and "simply campaigning will not work."  He must announce a bold new initiative.
                    AND
    2. The uproar in Texas over Governor Perry's plan to "fast-track" approval of 17 new power plants there.  Environmental and urban groups, many large city mayors, and even agricultural interests oppose these new "dirty" technology coal power plants.
 
    I urge you to discuss the following with the President:
 
    1. Bring the new power plants to be built in Texas into a greatly expanded version of President Bush's Clean Power Initiative.
    2. Meet with Governor Perry and Congressional leaders to begin finding the funding necessary for loans to Texas and the power companies to convert the plans for these new plants from the older "dirty" technology to the high technology clean plants using the "Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 Selections" as prototypes, for example the Southern Company Services plant near Orlando.
    3. Get the nation talking seriously about airborne process scrubbers, coal gasification, integrated gasification combined power plants, and advanced multi-pollution controls, as well as mercury contamination reduction.  It should be compared to FDR's Manhattan Project for the development of the atom bomb.
 
    This proposal would capture the imagination of America, pre-empt the Democrats, take great advantage of the current ongoing nationwide ad campaign of the Coal Industry, and have far-reaching implications for national security because of the abundance of coal in the US and our increasingly difficult relations with the Mideast for sources of oil. We can regain our independence from the Middle East (and from European politics) by relying on US coal, but only if its expanded use is clean.
 
    Its worth spending a great deal of government money on.  Asking Americans to sacrifice to bring it to fruition is the kind of risk we as Republicans must take in order to be the party that offers bold, confident leadership for America.
                    
                                                    Very Respectfully,

FAMILY DAY HOSTED AT THE CAPITOL

On Monday, First Lady Columba Bush, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings, and Florida
Office of Drug Control Director Bill Janes and I hosted "Family Day" at the
Capitol to encourage families to spend time together. The celebration
demonstrates how simple activities, such as eating dinner together as a
family, can open the lines of communication, strengthen families and
increase the likelihood children will remain drug-free. Taking an active
role in our children's lives is the single best way to prevent drug use.
Regular conversations and open dialogues are easy ways for parents to learn
more about their children, get to know their friends and help them with the
challenges of growing up in today's world. "Family Day - A Day to Eat
Dinner With Your Children" is part of a national campaign led by President
George W. Bush and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at
Columbia University (CASA). Families are encouraged to talk to their
children about avoiding the dangers of substance abuse, underage drinking
and smoking. Florida was the first state to adopt the "Family Day" program
in 2001 when President Bush proclaimed it as "a day to spend quality time
with family members and engage in other wholesome activities that help unite
and strengthen the bonds between parents and children". For more
information on "Family Day", please visit www.floridafamilyday.com.


TORREY PINES WELCOMED TO FLORIDA

On Tuesday, I joined Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies Founder
and President Dr. Richard Houghten, incoming Senate President Ken Pruitt and
a host of industry, state and community leaders to officially announce the
Institute's plans to establish a Florida headquarters in the master-planned
community of Tradition in St. Lucie County. The Institute will spur the
creation of many new, high-wage jobs on the Treasure Coast in its pursuit of
significant biomedical research. The decision by Torrey Pines Institute for
Molecular Studies to expand into Florida further establishes our state as a
hub for advanced biomedical research and commercialization. This move will
have a significant impact on the local economy while continuing to build
upon a growing life sciences sector in Florida. I congratulate St. Lucie
and the entire Treasure Coast region for their aggressive and successful
recruitment of Torrey Pines. I wish Torrey Pines great success in Florida.

STUDENTS ATTEMPT TO BREAK A WORLD RECORD

On Thursday, I joined nearly 300,000 middle school students statewide in an
attempt to break the Guinness World Record(tm) for the "Most People Reading
Aloud Simultaneously in Multiple Locations". The event, Breaking a World
Record: Reading Aloud!, aimed to bolster reading among middle school
students. The record attempt was aired via a live public broadcast and
Webcast from Disney-MGM Studios. Promptly at 11:25 a.m., I led the students
in reading an excerpt from the book "Peter and the Starcatchers" written by
Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson. According to Guinness World Records(tm), the
current record is 155,528 students from 737 schools throughout the United
Kingdom who read William Wordsworth's poem "Daffodils", on March 19, 2004.
Jane Feber, an eighth grade teacher from Mandarin Middle School in Duval
County, came up with the idea of breaking the record and shared it with me.
In the coming months, the state will receive confirmation from Guinness as
to whether or not the attempt was successful. To view the Webcast of the
event, please visit www.JustReadFlorida.com.

My name is Adriana Lara and I am a citizen of Kissimmee. Yesterday at about 6 :00 am my sister in law Sandra V. Lara was brutally removed from her home by immigration officers. We do not understand what happened she has tried to fix her status here in the U.S., and at no point in time did they say she had deportation procedings against her. When she came here in 2000 she was caught by immigration but they let her go and she came to us. In 2001 she married a good man and had a son who is now 5 and in 2002 that good man was taken from her by a drunk driver , she then remarried and now has another son of 3 who are now both motherless and the oldest now has no parent here. We are writing to you and pleading to you to help us fix her situation and help us bring her back to her family she is a good woman who has only come here to work and help her family she has never been in trouble with the law . Please if there is any way you could help us before she is sent back to El Salvador let us know, we are on a thin rope right now and would like to hear from a good man like you . I thank you for your time.

Dear Mr. Bush,

As along time resident of Palm Beach County recent issues with my child have opened my eyes to what a time bomb we have on our hands. I really want to find out why if an illegal alien is arrested and convicted of a non violent crime, they are not immediately deported. We have members of the 18th street gang that have been arrested, some several times working a well known pizza place that caters to children, and the word is that they are in our country illegally.
Could you please forward this email to someone that can answer my question and lend some guidance on the illegal alien issue?

 Dear Mr. Bush:
 
My name is Mischelle, I am writing in hopes you can help, or guide me in anyway possible on a matter that is affecting my family. My husband came here almost 10 year ago and over stayed his visa, I know it was not the right thing to do, but we all sometimes make choices in life that are based on different circumstances. He was detained by immigration back in 2003, I paid his bond and his case has been in court ever since. I turned an I-30 for him at the same time. We have been appearing for the hearings, in which they advised us, as soon as the I-30 gets approved the Immigration case would be thrown out, so we have waited, and waited. I called INS and they told me that they could not approve his application until the case was out of court....I can't seem to get a straight answer. We went back to to court Oct 1, 2006. We were told to come back May 1, 2007 to wait on the approval of the I-30 once again, every time we have a appeared in court there is a different prosecutor, and my husband's file is being bounced around, therefore its not ever going to be approved or its never going to be resolved. I know that you hear this all the time...But honestly I just want a life...I work to support 3 people on a $26,000 year salary, I am supporting my family on credit cards...Why is it that people are allowed to view my family as just a number?. I don't know where else to turn, so if you can offer any guidance I would appreciate.

Of terrorism, individual and community despair while using modern mass media and the wide area network of the internet more affectively then those that opposed them.
 
Terrorism is a VIRUS that affects those who have loss faith in Humanity and the Goodness of Man; this virus seeks to divide and conquer the Individual Soul (his conscience), the collective soul of people and the complete Soul of Humanity. The Terrorist viruses which acts and enters the complacent distort community at the local level must be combated at the local level by:
 
1.      Unifying the True Religious Leaders in the local community to build the community body immune system to the Terrorist Virus. by promoting the fundamental beliefs of Human Oneness, Human Goodness and Human Salvation on Earth as well as in Heaven.
 
2.      Educate our educators at the local level to empower their students to take responsibility for their lives and guide them in the use of their own personal visions for their future as well as provide assistance in creation of a mission statement for their lives and a road map to Individual Success for reaching their goals.
 
3.      Elect Public representatives at the federal and local level who will combine their political, financial and over all knowledge-wisdom to combat complacency and create legislation that will not only cross the boundaries of local, state, and federal government but add to the creation of a victorious vibrant spirited American economy.  Unify the V.I.A into the G.I. Bill and create the next Great Generation of Americans.  
V.I.A. “Veterans Integration Act”
 
4.      Promote a dynamic, vibrant, growing economy by promoting policies & procedures that encourage the development of Licensed Small “Family” Business. Promote the “Middle Class” by enforcing the laws, Certified Business Licenses and Business Educational Requirements under the State and Federal Agencies. These procedures will raise the level of professional wages in all business including the Electrical, Mechanical, and Construction field and protect the public from un-licensed, low wage, un-trained, unprofessional  business activity while protecting the public from un-recognized, ill-legal immigration from foreign lands with terrorist intentions.
 
The name of American which belongs to you must always exalt your just pride in patriotism and your Union oath to be considered as the main prop of your Liberty and the love of the one oath to endear to you the preservation of the other.                           Ed Moore 09-25-06
 
 
V.I.A. Veterans Integration Act
Build the American Family Middle Class & The American Business Economy while Integrating our Veterans.
 
We as a Nation and as a People are at a determining moment in the Salvation of our Civilization and The World.
 
The New World War and its Quest for World Peace, Human Individual Freedom and the Salvation of Man will not be won on the battlefield on distant lands but in the hearts and minds of the American people and the good free people throughout the world. In some areas of the world fanatical Islamic fundamentalism is replacing communism as the principal instrument of violent change, seeking to turn the clock of history backwards by attaining power by whatever means necessary, and establishing dictatorial control based on their intolerant ideals. Let me point out that these evil fanatical terrorist are feeding the children of Islam and the World a evil faith, a doctrine of hate and are distorting the main principles of God; from a Loving, Just, Merciful, Giving God into a god of terror and fear, a god of evil. 
 
As our national leaders unite their resources and manpower to fight this evil human sickness of mankind and as our religious leaders of all faiths promote their true values and point out the evils of these terrorist and their doctrine of hate; our Soldiers on a distant land will create, defend and support a culture of peace and freedom so the roots of Individual Freedom can take root and support The Tree of Liberty and her branches of Economic, Political, and Religious Freedom.
 
We as Americans on the home front must create an environment of support for our Soldiers in Battle, by supporting Economic Legislation at home, for their Loved Ones, both Family and Fellow Soldiers. It will be the Spirit of Good Will of our Soldiers reinforced by the faith and belief that we as a Nation do care for their loved ones at home, which will make the determining spirit of victory grow at home & abroad; then the spirit will give edge to the sword, that preservers the spirit and freedom will prevail. We as Americans must hold the line of The Spirit of Victory. Our Soldiers in battle must always know that their nation at home is with them and this support must be shown by the way we as a Free Economic Nation create Laws at home to benefit the Welfare of their Family and their brother Soldiers.
 
First, may we recognize the economic fact that we as Americans live in a capitalistic society where the economic power is in the business class. Businessmen truly make the determining decisions in the employment process and provide the best on the job training. The real question to ask; is how to influence the business class to hire and train the spouses of our soldiers and our veteran soldier returning into capitalistic society and integrate these men and women into Society. 
 
I propose the State and Federal Government approve a G.I. Bill stating that all taxes and insurance normally paid by Employers and Employees in the cases of Spouses of Soldiers on active Combat Duty and Soldier Veterans returning from active duty be paid by the State and Federal Government: For the first two years Veterans are integrated back into society, In case of 50% Disabled Veterans for Life. This is to include: 1. State and Federal Income Tax, 2. Social Security Tax. 3. Workman’s Compensation, Disability, Medical “Insurance”.
(Apply economic benefit to Corporations and Business with 25 or less Employees)
 
The soldier simply puts in deed what most of us put in Words; he simply heals and transforms the world by taking on the suffering burden of his fellow man, his family, his friends, and his whole world. He so loves his family and fellow man that he takes upon him-self their suffering; and through his own Faith, Courage, and Love bears this burden until at home with his Family again. Those that equate the American Soldier with the terrorist who kill women and children while they commit human suicide have no understanding of the American Soldier, his history, and have never, been loved by the American Soldier; To protect the weak and the un-armed, to put him-self in harms way while having at the forefront of his mind the goal of returning home, to his family, his Nation, his freedom. He is the one that stands tall as a wall to protect, his family, his Nation, his World, his very way of life where his family and Children live and play.
 
The American Soldier understands that the wave of destruction must be stopped before it reaches his Home Land and before it destroys our Nation, our Civilization, our World, and our Way of Life. He understands that once these people on foreign land get a taste of Love and Freedom, they too, like the American Soldier will stand tall and spread the gospel of love, peace and freedom by their own example. As they too will want to preserve these Living Spiritual Principles of Life, Individual Liberty and Family Happiness for their Children.
 
The bottom Line, The American Soldier is the true strength and spirit of our nation. As Americans we must unit at home or we will lose our Way of Life, past, present, and future. How we now act at home will determine our Destiny as a Nation and as a People. Our destiny is in our hands.                                “Ed Moore” 09-25-06”

Dear Governor Bush:

I moved from Canada in 1989.  I have my green card, residence permanente.  
I did apply in February 2006 for my citizenship .  I send $400.00 to the 
USCIS (N-400 form)  and all the documents requested.  I never received any 
answer to them.  They lost my documents but they cashed my money order and 
they applied it to someoneelse. I have the back copy of my money order 
from Money Gramm.  They cashed it on March 3, 2006 but they applied it to 
an other case.  Since that time I went to the downtown Miami office, they 
told me to contact my congressman, and I did, I faxed all the documents 
and also the back copy of the money order. I don't know what to do 
anymore, I even sent back all the documents to the Mesquite office, and 
nobody answer back to me.  I don't know what they are doing with all my 
documents??? I am getting very frustrating.  Nobody care about my case.  
Can you help me please? Lisa Brousseau Galipeau, Hollywood, Florida.

Governor Bush,

I hate to bother you with such a small item but I feel it is necessary for you to understand what your constituents are going through in regards to hurricane relief with FEMA.   Granted, our loss is not nearly as devastating as others, but I believe when you read the correspondence below, you will get a very clear picture of the type of service this agency is offering the people of this state.   Keep in mind as you read, that while I am of course upset that our claim was denied (perhaps, that’s still unclear), I am more upset with the time wasted of myself, my wife, countless FEMA workers, and claims adjusters because the agency just doesn’t have their act together.  This is no big surprise, and yet, if I am a person of fairly reasonable intelligence can not understand the information I get from them, how can people that may not be as well educated?  Please take the time to read my letter to FEMA.  Our tax dollars are being severely mishandled by this agency and we just can not stand for it any longer.   

 

With respect,

Regarding: Application No. [REDACTED]   Disaster No. 1609

Comments: 
I just received a notice from your office today and was shocked to see that our request for assistance had been denied stating that “according to a review of your insurance documents, your losses are less than your deductible”.  After reading this,  I am left wondering if the 6 communications with your office have been inaccurate and misleading or if this one letter is inaccurate.

The electric meter and weather pole for the electric for our home were damaged by a tree that fell during Hurricane Wilma.  Florida Power and Light told us we had to have the units replaced before they would restore our power.  We contacted your agency immediately after meeting with an FP&L representative.   We did not get a generator to power our house, or purchase a chain saw to cut the tree (which WOULD have easily been covered by FEMA), we simply used a hand saw and got the permanent power that was damaged beyond repair and that we absolutely needed instead of using the ‘luxury items’ that we could have had covered like a chain saw and temporary power.  My wife, who has a neuro-muscular disease would have benefited from both, but we do not believe in taking advantage of programs that should be used for necessity.

I will review each contact we had with your office and would like a response in the form of an actual letter  - not a form letter -  to advise which communication was correct and why we received such confusing and contradictory information.  

Contact 1: 
When we first contacted FEMA after Hurricane Wilma, my wife spoke with a representative and told her that we did have insurance, however the damage amount was less than our deductible, but still significant enough so that we could not pay for the damage.   We simply do not have access to an unexpected $1300, especially not after paying for expenses preparing for a hurricane and for expenses after in relation to food, yard clean-up, etc.  – and unfortunately we are not in a position where we can take out loans.  As you should know, Floridians can not get insurance deductibles lower than a set percentage of the cost of the home for windstorm damage – there is no alternative.  If we could have a reduced deductible, we probably would.    Regardless, the person she spoke with said that she would list us as uninsured because technically, we did not have coverage for the loss.  

Contact 2:
We then received a denial letter stating that we were denied because we have insurance.

Contact 3:
My wife called the helpline number and spoke with a representative, explaining that yes, we have insurance as she reported but that the 1st representative said that basically we would be considered uninsured because we did not have coverage for the loss so she was listing us as not having insurance.  The new representative said the representative listed us as insured and we had to file an insurance claim.   My wife explained that we were hesitant to file a claim because the loss would not be covered because it was below our deductible and then our insurance rates would go up or we could potentially get dropped from insurance.  Though we know this is not SUPPOSED to happen, we all live in the real world and they DO find a way to drop you or increase rates, regardless of the laws that are SUPPOSED to protect us.   She asked the agent if she could just send our declaration page of the insurance and a copy of the invoice for work to show that the work cost was below our deductible.  The new representative said that it would make sense to do that and gave the FEMA fax number.

Contact 4:
After almost 4 weeks, my wife received a call at work from a FEMA representative stating that she would have to file a claim with the insurance company even though the declaration page showed the loss was less than the deductible.   My wife explained the insurance situation again and the representative stated that the insurance company could not increase our rates for hurricane damage and that we must file a claim and then send FEMA the denial letter in order to be considered for assistance.

Contact 5:
Several days later we received a confusing form letter from FEMA stating that we needed to file a claim with the insurance company but then giving us contradictory direction as to what we needed in regards to documentation for damage.   It also stated we had 10 days from the date on the letter to respond or the application would not be considered (keep in mind it took about 3 days for the letter to get to us, so the clock was ticking, luckily, our insurance company was fast).  We sent all the information that would cover BOTH of the directions on the confusing letter, along with a denial of coverage from our insurance company.   The denial of course, was because the loss was less than our deductible – which my wife said over and over again EVERY time she spoke with a FEMA representative and in every written correspondence.

Contact 6:
Approximately one week after we sent in the denial letter and requested information, we received a call from a FEMA representative that said someone would be coming by to check the damage.   My wife scheduled an appointment and took time out of work to meet with the representative.  She waited past the time of the appointment and called the contact who was delayed at another house.  He was very apologetic and rushed right over to the house.  I must note that he was extremely cordial, quick and efficient.  He verified the damage and did not make any commitments for payment – he may be the only person that handled the matter appropriately.

Contact 7:

Contact 7 was the letter I referenced in the first paragraph that states: “according to a review of your insurance documents, your losses are less than your deductible”.  Imagine our complete surprise to see this reason listed for denial.

I would like the following questions answered directly:

1. Which correspondence is correct and why were there so many contradictions with each contact.

2. IF the claim is actually denied for the reason stated, why did FEMA waste the very valuable time and energy of not only my wife and myself but of their own overworked employees?

3. IF the claim is denied for the reason stated, why would FEMA advise us to file a claim when they had all of the paperwork that proved the loss was less than the deductible and why did FEMA waste the very valuable time of overworked insurance adjusters.

4. IF the claim is denied for the reason stated, why does FEMA deny a necessary electrical repair (that is below our insurance deductible but that we can not afford) in order to restore PERMANENT power when the agency covers the cost for a convenience item like a generator for TEMPORARY power – which in most cases (except with the elderly and disable persons) is truly a luxury item.

5. IF the claim is denied for the reason stated, do you suggest my wife and I cancel our windstorm insurance that has now been increased to $1500 per year so we would qualify for very necessary, unexpected hurricane damage?  

6. IF the claim is denied for the reason stated, it appears that FEMA would have preferred we find a temporary solution for power – with an $800 generator that you would have been covered (especially because my wife has a disability), until we could pay for permanent power without missing car payments, credit card and doctor payments which we are still trying to recoup? 

Because we’ve had so much confusing correspondence with your agency, your prompt and thorough attention to this matter is appreciated.   

Sincerely,

Subject:	Need your assistance with a visitor visa

Dear Governor Bush,

You are my last hope in giving me a chance to see my sister.

I have been a Florida resident for the past fourteen years. On July 19, 1992 we moved here from Ukraine with my husband, two sons and terminally ill father – who passed away from cancer just three moths later, and was buried here.  

The only living relative that I have left is my sisters, who have visited me twice in summer 1994 and summer 1996. 

While on her second visit, in 1996, my sister was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital emergency room in critical condition requiring her to do surgery.  At that time we submitted her passport, her visa and medical records from the Mount Sinai Hospital to Washington to get an extension on her visitor visa according to INS Rules and Regulations. Two weeks later we received her visa and passport back with new stamps extending her visa for another six months. Since my sister did no want to put such a big debt on me, she decided to do surgery procedure in Ukraine. Once she got home, she was diagnosed with Stage III Cancer and had to go through two surgeries and chemotherapy since.

 In 2002 when my sister applied for the non-immigrant visa so that she can come and be with us and visit her fathers grave on the tenth year anniversary from his death her visa was denied. Reason given, that she was not convincing enough that she would not try to stay permanently here in US.

My sister has no plans of staying here in U.S. She has all her family there: her husband, her two daughters, and three grandchildren, her own apartment, free Medicare and a good pension.

This year I invited my sister to come and visit me and my children, who already graduated from Florida Universities, and who she did not see for over 10 years. I prepared all the paperwork; send a notarized letter saying that I would never apply for a permanent US residence for my sister, and even contacted Senator Nelson to look in to the case. But yesterday, on October 3rd, 2006, when my sister went to US Embassy in Kiev for the interview, her visa was denied again. This time the reason they gave her is that ten years ago, in 1996, she stayed in US longer then six moths – violating her visa.

You are my only hope. If you can only give my sister a chance to come and visit me – that's all that I am asking you for. My sisters' health is deteriorating, and now might be the last chance that she will ever be able to come.

I am a hard working teacher here in South Florida, I always teach my kids to be honest, follow the rules and be good citizens. And now I need your help.

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

My name is SSG Traci Robles I have worked for the Florida Army National Guard for over 10 years. I have found myself in a difficult situation. I have been married to my husband for over 2 years. We married after I came home from Iraq in 2004. The problem is we found out my husband has a Deportation Order and could possibly have to be returned or deported back to Colombia. He has been in USA for over 11 years thinking everything was fine, his mother and father were residents and his father recently passed away to cancer. My husband has Power of Attorney over my children in the event of another deployment from the military. We have tried to go through many lawyers and getting very mixed information and financially drained from all the costs. I have no other choice but to try to be honest even if it will hurt my family situation, I cannot lie and risk losing my career and my family. Is there anyway you can help me and my husband in this situation or give me advice of how to approach this situation before something bad happens to my family and my military career.   

 

I am sorry to bother you with this, I know you have other very important issues in the State of Florida but I do not know where else to go or who else to talk to for help.

I'm sure Governor Jeb Bush isn't the one who will read this e-mail. My main concern is to reach a person who might find it of some importance and give it some consideration.  Please forward it to the appropriate person who might make any changes in the system.  It could be one of your relatives that will be effected by these changes.  
 
I work for a physician's office and everyday this year I have heard more and more horror stories from the elderly of the deceit they have experienced from insurance representatives as they have tried to sign up for a supplemental insurance or Medicare part D and, unannounced to them, ended up with a Medicare HMO.  It ends up being a night mare for them as well as a financial burden.  The physicians office is also effected.  Not everyone has a family member to help them straighten it out or help them understand and its very sad to see this happen.  One of us usually tries to take on that role and it has really been a trying year.  
 
 I'd like to make a suggestion.  I think it should be a requirement that the beneficiary receive a Medicare card that states Medicare HMO with the name of the Medicare HMO and the address and phone number on the card.  It sure would make it easier on everyone involved.  I think the insurance company should be required to deliver the card to the insured within a certain time frame and then the insured should have a 30 day time frame to change their mind.  MOST of them do not know they have the HMO. 
 
It's very sad to stand by and watch this day by day and do nothing to help them.  Our office wants to see it stop. We are tired of seeing the elderly taken advantage of.  Please help us.

The Honorable Jeb Bush

The Capitol, 400 S. Monroe St.

 Governor Bush:

Mr. Bush,
  My name is Michael A. May I am U.S. citizen born and raised in this 
country and I currently reside in Naples Florida, and I am ashamed of what 
my country is doing to good and decent people who are looking for 
protection from the oppression and danger of their home country and I am 
begging you for help in this matter!
  On September 18th my fiance was arrested at her place of employment and 
taken into custody by I.C.E. agents in what was called "OPERATION RETURN 
TO SENDER'. My fiance is Nubia Zuluaga a Colombian citizen who came to the 
United States for asylum in Feb. 2001. Nubia was working at Vitarich 
Laboratories when the agents showed up to arrest her. She was taken 
immediately in handcuffs and put in a squad car and taken to Fort Myers 
and then transferred to Pompano Beach. She was not given an opportunity to 
contact her lawyer or my self or to even know what was happening to her! 
Nubia was not allowed to have any personal affects including her 
eyeglasses which she needs to see with and even though she was in a police 
car 5 feet from me, I was not allowed to say goodbye to her or speak with 
her. Nubia was assured by her attorney that because she had a case pending 
for asylum that she would not be picked up. He was wrong! Nubia and myself 
have been together for over 1 year now and I am devastated! On Friday the 
22nd of Sept. Nubia was transferred to the Regional Correctional Center in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
    Mr. Bush all she knows and cares about is here in Naples. Nubia is 
currently being held in a  prison for the simple crime of loving America 
and believing in her attorney, that she had a case for asylum. Mr. Bush, I 
assure you sir, that Nubia is no danger to a fly much less this great 
country of ours to justify this kind of treatment! I have been given at 
least 8 different phone numbers to call and I get no answers and no 
returned calls. We cannot find out the status of her case, why she is 
being treated like a criminal when she has never even had a parking 
ticket, why she was moved halfway across the country and why she is unable 
to contact her loved ones or her attorney and why we cannot contact her?   
  
  Mr. Bush I am writing to you in the hope that there is someone in my 
government who has the ability to give this woman, who is my love, my 
companion and my friend her human dignity back. I and her attorney are 
unable to even find out if we can bond her out to let her go back to 
Colombia on her own ,which she would I am saddened to say, because of the 
way my country has treated  her. I am ashamed that the greatest country on 
this earth is reduced to these kind of tactics against people who believe 
in the American dream of freedom! 
  Oh sure the " RETURN TO SENDER" operation caught 23 out of 163 people 
with criminal records but, what about the other poor souls who like my 
Nubia only wanted to be free in the greatest country in the world? She was 
one of those 163 people who worked hard and did everything she was 
supposed to for the American dream that has turned out to be a nightmare! 
Mr. Bush I am pleading with you to use your influence to rectify this 
situation and bring my Nubia home! Or at least get her out of the prison 
she is in so she can get her affairs in order and go back to Colombia. 

Sincerely,

Several years ago, you signed a State of Florida Proclamation, recognizing my effort in developing the WISE program.  WISE stood for Weapons In School Eliminated and the program was tested for a year at my local high school.  During that time, three weapons were recovered, no student or faculty member hurt and the entire cost was paid by the business community.
 
Despite my best efforts in visiting Washington and Tallahassee, my idea could never get past the various school boards.  When a parent has an idea that works, my thought is the school system should listen.  While your recognition was appreciated, my thought now is that President Bush could use my idea to roll out a national solution.  I'd be happy to donate it, providing it used in the framework that it was designed.
 
Please take a few moments to log on the www.nhis.org and click the "about us" section.  This site is under development, so few people know it exists.  There is more information about WISE on the site.  I don't sell this program nor have I ever generated a dime of income.  When a student brought a .357 magnum to my daughters middle school, I came up with a solution.  Now, as she is ready to graduate UCF, perhaps someone is ready to accept it.
 
I'd be happy to participate in any way possible to help with this program.

Hello.

This is a long shot, but I'm hoping that you will understand our  
URGENT problem and perhaps be able to help.

I'm co-artistic director of Tall Stories, a not-for-profit British  
children's theatre company. Our show 'The Snow Dragon' is due to  
start a tour of the US at the Van Wezel Center, Sarasota, Florida,  
THIS SATURDAY October 7. We have a petition for nonimmigrant workers  
visas (I129) pending with USCIS in California. We've been informed  
verbally that we've been approved for the visas, but we haven't  
received written confirmation yet. It seems to be stuck in the system  
somewhere...

If we don't get this written approval TODAY, we won't be able to get  
our visas from the US embassy here in London in time and we'll have  
to cancel the tour. A lot of Floridian and other American children  
are going to be disappointed...

If there's anything you can do to help, please do! Our case receipt  
number with USCIS California is WAC0622654156.

Many thanks.

Subject:	Waiting 3 years for Social Security

Dear Governor Jeb Bush
         Senator Mel Martinez
          Congressman Billirakis:      My name is Michelle Emerson.  I am a 42 year old mother, resident of Florida since 1979 and a Republican.
 
I cannot express the frustration I have with the Social Security Administration in our state.  
 
I suffer from severe emotional depression, I am bi-polar, and have a slew of health problems including Diabetes and Myositis ( a form of Lupus). 
 
I was applied for Social Security in September 2004.  At that time I was told it could take up to 12 months.  I provided all the documentation that was requested including reports from my doctors and psychiatrist and therapist.  
 
December 4 2004 I was scheduled to see a doctor of the Social Security Administrations choice for examination at the Brandon Walk-in Clinic.  The doctor did not know why I was there until I explained.  My examine took less the 30 minutes.
 
On December 7, 2004 I was accidentally scheduled for another appointment with the same doctor.  Ooops was the excuse. 
 
I could get no information on my case until March 12 2005 I was scheduled for an appointment with a psychologist  of the Social Security Administrations choice.  Again my appointment was short to the point and he concurred with my own doctor and therapist.
 
April 1 2005 I received a letter of rejection.  I was advised to hire an attorney.
 
April 26 2005 I hired an attorney and he filed an appeal.
 
On May 10 2005 I received a request for more information before the appeal could even be processed.  When I asked how that could be, no one could clearly understand.
 
May 20 2005 I received another letter of rejection for my appeal.  Less then a month after filing the appeal it was processed, reviewed, rejected and returned to me.
 
On May 25 2005 my attorney file for a hearing with a Administrative Judge.
 
On July 5 2005 I received a notice that my case would be heard before a judge.  
 
August 15 2005 I wrote a letter to expedite my case because my husband had a work related injury.  He fell 35 feet on the job and broke his back in 3 places and had head trauma.  My medication has been increased.  I had been treated for anxiety attracts twice and hospitalized once.  Workers Compensation was less the he made with his regular pay. I had to pay to keep our health insurance active for me.  We were barely getting by before, now we were desperate.  
 
On May 19 2006  a letter to me explained that my situation was not severe enough to warrant moving my case up.  The letter came 10 month later.  I had no contact and could get no information from the Social Security Administration.
 
September 1 2006 I called the Social Security Administration to beg for information on my case.  I found that my file had gone to a review attorney and he would decided to grant me my social security for put it before a judge.  I was also told that this process could take another 12 months.
 
If I was not crazy and depressed before, I sure am now.  I am 32 months into this process.
In four more months this will be THREE YEARS.   My family cannot longer wait another 12 months for this governmental process.  We have begged and borrowed all we can.  We have had to take out a second mortgage to survive.  I owe my family members so much I can't ask for more.  Robert was out of work for 10 months.  He has gone back at a light duty job that has no overtime and less pay.  And I am still waiting patiently.  
 
How would any one expect a person who had no support survives 32 months without the disability?  I hate to think of all the people who have given up.  No wonder the mentally ill are wandering the streets.  They can't get the Social Security they deserve.
 
I am asking, no I am begging that someone help me move this process along.  My family cannot wait another 12 months for a end to this unnecessary process.
 
Someone please help me !!

Subject:	Flood Insurance Crisis - We need your help
Attachments:	Press Release.doc

As residents of Destin, Florida, we desperately need your help with our flood insurance crisis.
 
We, like over two thousand other homeowners in our area, have recently learned that we cannot obtain flood insurance because our homes are within a CBRA zone.  We are ineligible for coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program which prohibits federal assistance to Coastal Barrier Resource Areas, and we have found that we cannot buy insurance in the private sector because they are no longer writing flood insurance policies in CBRA zones.
 
Until a few months ago, we were able to obtain coverage through private insurers.  Without this protection we now find ourselves totally vulnerable to the threat of a major storm.  Not only do we face the possibility of losing our life's major investment but also the inability to sell our "uninsurable" home except to someone who can buy it without a mortgage (since lenders require flood insurance in a SFHA) and who is willing to forego flood insurance coverage.
 
This dilemma has had a major impact on the real estate market in our community.  Sales are at a dead standstill, and property values are dropping dramatically.  As you must realize, this ultimately will result in the loss of local economic health.  In August Governor Bush appointed a new "Committee for a Sustainable Emerald Coast" to chart the course for the future of our region.  A solution to our flood insurance crisis is critical to sustaining the economy of the Emerald Coast!
 
Attached is a full description of this issue, as well as possible remedies, written by Robert Guidara, who is a member of the Taskforce for Attainable Flood Insurance (TAFI).  We are asking that you please read this material and do what you can to help restore a readily available and reasonably affordable way to obtain flood insurance.

Subject:	State Laws concerning Pay Day Loans

 

         Hello,  my name is John P. Stanton and I have recently read that Congress is trying to pass a law about the amount of finance charges a pay day loan charges to our service men and women.  Congress is trying to cap the interest rate to 36% for our service men.  My question to you is,  Why would Congress only be concerned about our service men and women and not the rest of the population?  It seems to me that if the interest rate is to high for these people,  it would also be the case for everyone else who uses these services.  I also read that there are 27 states that have laws about these interest rates and Florida is not one of them.   Why would Florida not want to protect the people that use these services from being charged excessive interest rates that,  in my opinion,  prey on the poor and working class people?  Maybe you or someone else can explain that to me.   Why is Florida not concerned about that,  maybe because people like you have never had to use these services to pay your bills so you have no idea how they work.  Well I have used these services and I can speak from experience that this is a vicious cycle that is very hard to come out of.  Lucky for me I was able to.  Not the case for many others.  Maybe you can look into this for me and tell me who can help if your unable to?  Thank you for your time.  John Stanton 7507 Fort Walton Ave,  Fort Pierce,  Fl.  34951.

Dear Honorable Jeb Bush,
 
     Why Doesn't the United States support an Independent Kurdish Democratic Nation in Northern Iraq,  wouldn't that be a logical  move for peace in Southeast Turkey? Wouldn't this also give us a stronger ally in the middle east. This New nation would see that the United States has fought to protect their people from genocide, taken out an enemy of  both of ours (Saddam), plus also basically allowed them to run northern Iraq as they want since the War and will see that the U.S. will continue to support their people.
    
     We should do this by offering them a proposal asking all the Kurds (roughly 25million) to move into Northern Iraq and showing the world that they want peace (having a PKK cease-fire last longer then 14 months or the Kurd people help stop the PKK for 14 months while their people move to northern Iraq) as long as they can be free. With the help of the Turkish government offering aid and helping with the infrastructure, this could also lead to peace between the two nations. Having a Kurdish Nation  will also show that America supports all religious groups and cultures that want a face and need a voice in a fast moving world. We also should allow Israel to help the KURDS build a stronger nation to show that they too also care about all people that want a voice and peace.  
 
    If you head the project this will make you look like a man of compassion(which you our) to the world, also will show the country that you are a diplomat(shown in your bilingual quality) as well as a  governor. Plus if you go to Kurdistan you look like a man of their  people as well as ours because you want peace in the world and your willing to go in the heat of a war and support. Going to Iraq you can also stop and talk to the troops and thank them for their courage.This should also help in lowering the cost of gas because peace could soon be on the way. With only a small time left in Florida in which you have I would like to see you help our nation and their people go further in the direction of peace/equality and maybe you president in 2008.     
 
        Well if you not becoming president, why can't there be a Kurdish Nation, and how come know one with power like you has  fought for either a nation or there equality in Turkey?

Subject:	[*] RE: We need your intervention

Dear L.D. McDonald,
Thank you for your quick response. While we realize that this is within federal jurisdiction, our federal requests for intervention appear to be tied up in "political red tape". Would it be possible for the Governor to personally forward our request to his brother ?  Our initial issue was quite similar to that experienced by President Bush during his military enlistment. Unfortunately due to the magnitude of the Presidential responsibilities, gaining the President's attention without personal intervention, is impossible. We have attempted to contact our local congressman and senators, who refer us to the federal sites, who in return, direct us back to our local politicians. While this revolving door has us captured, our patients are without our care, and rather than contributing to the tax basin, we are quickly becoming eligible to be recipients.

We'd appreciate the Governor's kind assistance.

Respectfully,
Drs. Dan and Sue Semko

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Semko:
 	
Florida Governor Jeb Bush received the email you sent him and asked me to reply. The Governor is sorry to learn about your situation.

As you may know, the federal government oversees federal pardons and Governor Bush has very limited authority to intervene. Your best source of assistance is your United States Congressional Delegation. You can find contact information for your United States Senators and Representative at this web site...

Governor Bush hopes this information is helpful.  The Governor wishes he could be of more assistance, please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction and not lack of concern.

Dear Governor Bush, 
My wife and I are both Podiatrists and need your assistance in having our records expunged or commuted federally through your direct intervention with your brother. We've attempted to contact President Bush for his clemency but encountered the bureaucratic "red tape" from the Pardon Attorney Roger Adams. I am a Viet Nam veteran and made a poor choice in assisting a fellow colleague, which I deeply regret. My absence from the VA hospital is quite similar to the Presidents absence from duty that the press has repeatedly embellished. We want to regain a gainful means of employment and return to contributing towards the medical care of our patients, many are your residents who reside here throughout the Summer and Fall months. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. Below is a synopsis of the events that initiated our legal problems.

Veterans Administration / Federal Disagreement In March of 1997 Dr. Suzanne A. Haritatos(Semko) contacted Dr. Benadict A. Profera, a personal friend, colleague and former classmate from The Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine and acting Chief of the Salem Virginia Veterans Administration Hospital Podiatric Department, regarding an application for the RPR 12 Podiatric Residency Program offered in July of 1997. Dr. Haritatos (Semko's) intent was to gain hospital experience and exposure to veteran related Podiatric problems. In May of 1997, Dr. Haritaos (Semko) accompanied by her partner and husband, Dr. Daniel Semko, traveled to Salem, Virginia to visit their old friend and learn about the residency program. During that period of investigation, both Dr. Haritatos (Semko) and Dr. Semko learned that Dr. Profera was involved in a bitter divorce and in difficult financial straights. Dr. Semko, as a friend, offered to loan Dr. Profera funds to assist with his financial difficulties. After this visit, upon returning to their active practice in Richmond, Indiana, and upon consideration of the program and the logistics of their clinical practice, Dr. Haritatos (Semko) and Dr. Semko concluded that a full time position for Dr. Haritatos (Semko) at the Residency program in Salem, Virginia, could be arranged provided that Dr. Semko assumed and was able to continue on his own, the full responsibilities of their joint practice. When this information was conveyed to Dr. Profera, he stated that since he had two positions to fill and because Drs. Haritatos (Semko) and Semko were married, he wanted both doctors to accept the open billets. Dr. Profera stated that he had complete discretion over the program and could modify the programs such that their Indiana Podiatric practice would not be jeopardized. Accordingly, Dr. Haritatos (Semko) and Dr. Semko agreed to accept the positions commencing July 1, 1997. In October of 1997, both Dr. Haritatos (Semko) and Dr. Semko became increasingly ware that Dr. Profera was not providing the scheduled hospital rotations previously promised as being included in the residency program. Attempts to have access to these rotations severely enhanced Dr. Profera's agitation which appeared chronically maximized by his impending divorce and other reasons unrelated to the residency program. In late January to early February, the situation deteriorated significantly. In early February of 1998, Dr. Profera was repeatedly irrational and abusive to Dr. Haritatos (Semko). As a result, Dr. Semko, who was for the most part maintaining their clinical practice in Richmond, Indiana, felt that protective actions for his wife's interests and safety were necessary. Without warning, Dr. Profera then announced the termination of the program to Dr. Haritatos (Semko). Dr. Semko arrived in Salem to assist his wife in leaving the program shortly thereafter. During the process of terminating their V.A. authorizations, Dr. Semko and Dr. Haritatos (Semko) learned that Dr. Profera in fact did not have the authority to modify or terminate the residency program. Dr. Profera had approached the Chief of Staff stating that although he had stated that he was terminating the program, he wanted both doctors to receive "certificates of completion" which was indeed a break from the accepted standards which governed the residency program. That same day, Dr. Profera approached the hospital security chief and stated that he "thought that he was in the middle of a bribery scheme." These conflicting actions initiated an FBI investigation regarding the entire situation. In June of 2002, Dr. Haritatos (Semko) and Dr. Semko fully cooperated with the federal government's investigation and prosecution. Each provided a statement to the government that the above referenced funds had been lent to Dr. Profera in part to assist him but as well with the goal of achieving preferential treatment for Dr. Semko in regard to the relaxation of the requirement of Dr. Semko's physical presence at the Salem V.A. residency program. Further, Dr. Semko and Dr. Haritatos(Semko) indicated that checks were automatically deposited and transferred for Dr. Semko's services to the V.A. residency. Page Two Dr. Haritatos (Semko) plead guilty to aiding and abetting misdemeanor theft which stemmed from the cashing of the V.A. check in the amount of $802.00 pursuant to her husband Dr. Semko's services to the residency which the government alleged Dr. Semko had not fully performed. Dr. Semko plead guilty to one count of wire fraud which stemmed from the wiring of funds for a paycheck issued to Dr. Semko which had been automatically deposited into the V.A. Credit Union and then check transferred to the Semko's checking account in Richmond, Indiana. The court ordered and Drs. Semko and Dr. Haritatos (Semko), paid complete restitution of funds derived from Dr. Semko's salary. Additionally, the court imposed a fine against each doctor and placed each on probation Dr. Semko and Dr. Haritatos (Semko) have taken full and complete responsibility for their actions none of which are remotely related to their Podiatric practice. Prior to this incident, both doctors have maintained careers of gainful employment in private practice, have had no civil, criminal or medical infractions and have provided a valuable service to the residents of Richmond. The sole purpose of exploring the V.A. Residency Program was to enhance Dr. Haritatos (Semko's) hospital and veteran exposure. Dr. Semko has an extensive medical background as a Navy Hospital Corpsman stationed in Viet Nam and as an Orthopedic Physicians Assistant. His personal benefit from the V.A. program other than supporting his wife's desire to expand her medical experience, would have been negligible at best. Dr. Semko and Dr. Haritatos (Semko) consider this bizarre series of circumstances to be an aberration. Each doctor has made complete financial restitution and abided by the probationary guidelines set forth by the court. Both doctors satisfied all of the requirements, fines and guidelines set forth by the court and were duly released from all encumbrances. Dr. Haritatos (Semko) and Dr. Semko deeply regret the difficulties and inconveniences resulting from this matter.

October 2, 2006

Governor Jeb Bush

State of Florida

Office of the Governor

The Capitol

Tallahassee, Fl. 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush, 

In February 2006, I wrote to you requesting your assistance with my retirement from the United States Secret Service. I followed your advice and the results were very informative.

On June 20, 2006, I received a response from Senator Kennedy concerning an inquiry he made on my behalf to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security - U. S. Secret Service.

I was happy to learn I had to appeal a decision made by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The Initial Decision was rendered in April 2000, termination, by Judge William C. Jenkins. I never received the Initial Decision, which gave me the opportunity to appeal within 30 days. I spoke with Bernard Parker, a clerk with the MSPB, he stated to file an appeal, but the length of time was a concern to him. I wrote a letter to the Clerk of the Board, Mr. Roberts, to request an extension of time to file for a petition for review. He has denied my request to file a petition for review. As stated earlier, I never received the initial decision, and was made aware of it, through the research Senator Kennedy asked the Secret Service to initiate.

I brought a lawsuit against the Secret Service for discrimination, in 1996. I won, and then retaliation began. My family was affected and my marriage deteriorated. Allegations were made by my husband, and brought to the attention of Inspector Teter, who was named in the initial lawsuit, who came to my home and confiscated our antique gun collection, which was packaged and stored in the attic of our residence. He then had my gun and badge removed. All this was done without my being questioned about my husbands allegations, or any investigation ever being conducted by Inspector Teter. 

Because of the harrassment, we agreed to retire at 66 2/3. My concern was that the attorney never addressed the first lawsuit; therefore, the retaliation was never addressed. I ran out of money paying both my divorce attorney and work attorney. 

I took the tests required by the Secret Service Police and Fire Clinic, to go before the retirement board. I learned the Secret Service doctors had diagnosed depression, without ever having seen me. The diagnose was not from the Police and Fire Clinic, but from an outside doctor, hired by the Secret Service. After taking the test, I began to have second thoughts about retiring, without legal representation, to address the depression issue, because, I did not feel depressed. I asked the doctor, who administered the test for retirement, if I could finish with my divorce first. I would then retain an attorney for my retirement. The Police and Fire Clinic doctor agreed.

I was contacted by Saic Buck Tanis, who was not familiar with me or my case, gave me an ultimatum to either resign or be terminated. The hearing was held with the DC Merit Protection Board, whose decision I had not received until Senator Kennedy’s assistance, in June 2006. 

The reason for my agreement to retire was the retaliation I received. There was no disciplinary action, or any wrongdoing on my part. My yearly evaluations were above average. None of these things played a part in MSPB Judge Jenkins decision to accept termination. The reason I was terminated was due to the expiration of my top-secret clearance, which is explained in the attached letter.

I would like to appeal, Judge Jenkins decision, and have the termination removed from my record and my Top Secret Security Clearance returned. I had a 20-year retirement under the DC Police and Firemans Retirement System. The U.S. Secret Service hired me in 1981, I would have retired in 2001, and I was terminated in 2000, with 19 years on. 

PLEASE, assist me with my retirement. I have three children who are in high school and will be going to college. With termination on my record, it is extremely difficult to get any where near the salary of $54,000.00, which I made with the U.S. Secret Service. Financially, I fear for our future.

I have hired the law firm of Mahoney & Mahoney, 1300 Penn. Ave Wash., D.C. (202) 204-2520. I have sent them a $7,500.00 retainer, which I got, from taking out my retirement deductions from the Police and Fire Retirement Board. The attorney’s have indicated that retirement looks bleak, because, the Secret Service has won. It would not benefit them to give me my retirement. I do not consider this a win, lose competition. I would like to receive what is rightfully mine, and was unable to attain because I did not receive the initial decision given by the DC Merit Protection Board.

Would it be possible for you to ask your brother, the President, and your Mom and Dad, to request Secret Service Director Sullivan to assist me with my retirement process, to have the termination reversed through Secret Service Counsel, my Top Secret Clearance reinstated, and pursue my retirement as we all initially agreed, or a reinstatement to finish my retirement, so I can count on a fairly, financially secure future for myself and my children.

Thank you so much for all of your assistance.

Sincerely,

My father has a PhD in Ecology and has been working for four years at Kennedy Space Center as a post doctoral fellow. He has doing research related with carbon sequestration capacity in Florida ecosystems, green house gasses emissions and global changes, fields that I know have been of great interest to this country in the past few years. He has a working visa (H1) and to be able to work he needs a sponsor. Even thou he has been arduously looking for sponsor, he has not been able to find an institution that would do it. This is where I thought you could help us. I have read about you concerns with the environmental problems, and I know USA is one of the top countries supporting research to conserve the environment. That is the top reason to why we moved here in the first place, my father completed his post- doctorate here. This leads me to think my father's job could continue to be valuable to this country, but he needs on opportunity.
I'm just asking for a job that would allow us to continue living and working in this country. Our visas expire November third this year. Even thou he keeps looking for an institution, I wanted to help asking you to help us.
We're a family of five and each and every one of us tries as hard as possible to improve ourselves and therefore this country. My mother has a Bachelor Degree in Biology Education, with a certification to teach Spanish but due to our visas she is unable to work at the moment. My sister who is 18 is currently at the University of Florida already on her 4th. semester of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, she is an excellent student enrolled in the honor program. I am, as I mentioned before, a junior currently taking Advance Placement and Dual Enrollment courses and my brother who is in 5th. grade is part of the Gifted program at his school.
As you can see we are a family with an outstanding academic performance and would only like  to keep receiving the best education here because in our country(Venezuela) things tend to be a little more difficult.
Please, excuse my petition, I know its something rather difficult to achieve, but I am very worried and I believe you are capable of helping us. If you think its necessary I could send you my father's resume, our records or any other  information. My email is evelyn_bracho@hotmail.com. Hoping to hear from you,
Sincerely,
Evelyn Bracho.

MR GOVERNOR,
                     I am not sure if you will be the one reading this email 
as I strongly doubt you would be able to keep up with your busy 
scheduled,however I can only try and hope this may pass from your assistants 
eyes to your ears.
                     I am originally from Jamaica and has been in the USA 
along with my kids for almost 13years (we are green cards holders) I have 
always been employed and paid my taxes   we never had any problems with the 
law or gotten or need any kind of public assistance(thank god).I have 
sisters,nieces,nephews and one brother still in Jamaica frankly about 10 
total my parents had 12 kids.
                   I am sure you are familiar with how hard it is to obtain 
a visitors visa from there to visit USA for e.g. my youngest sister applied 
in March of this year the counselor told her in order to give her visa she 
needed a bank statement so she went for her statement went back other day 
same counselor was very rude told her to get away from her she wasnt 
issusing no visa,the security guard @ the embassy told my sister thats how 
that counselor is when shes in a bad mood.(I do understand we are all humans 
but for some jobs we have to leave our personal issues @ the door).
                    However that was just an example of difficulties faced 
in obtaining a visa.W e are not rich or do we have the resources to house or 
finance all my family at once,all I am hoping for is that they can come to 
visit whenever they can afford to,so they too can see what the United States 
is all about as they have jobs,lives and families in Jamaica they have to go 
back to.I know it may be hard to believe but not everyone is interested in 
being in this country illegally (especially now its almost impossible).So 
what I am asking for is a few entry permits for my family ,Homeland security 
can follow them around when they each get here no problem! and please dont 
reply by telling me your office dont get involve in this aspect as I have 
know its possible via your office or a phone call.
                        I know it may sound like a lot but I am willing to 
compromise and hope my letter may be a little different from your everyday 
criticisms,complaints and stress.My kids are growing, not knowing their 
aunts and cousins as you see my siblings and I are very close knit and would 
like to instill same in our kids,its always a car repair, doctors bill, or 
something that makes it impossible for us to visit back home as we would 
like but it would be real nice if they could come visit when they 
like.Anyway as you see its only this tiny huge favour I need.Please respond 
to my email and if needed you can order background check on my family in Ja 
for e.g one of my nephew is a Police Officer, one ofmy sister owns her own 
store,another sister is assistant to City Counsel etc and besides my kids 
ace fcat  every year just look @ my daughters score Daneele Sutton Pompano 
High she will make you proud,just look at it as a thank u,farewell gift to 
us.

                                                                             
    THANK YOU & ALL

Dear Govenor Bush
 
My name is Pamela J. Colbert, I wrote you a couple of years ago regarding a workmans compensation accident in 2002, you were very helpful with that, for that I thank you again.
 
I once again need your help.  I am a 48 year old single white female, since the injury, I have tried to work which is impossible. I have applied for Social Security and been denied a few times (I hear this is normal??) I have obtained an attorney which I am told is necessary (that is sad) I have a severe neck, back, and hip injury from the original accident in 2002.  The state has finally granted me food stamps (barely enough to eat on) I am not able to receive ANY medical help. I seem to fall through the cracks, I am in dire need of medical help, without proper medical care and medications I am unable to walk , stand or sit for any length of time.  I received a letter from the atty's that our SSI SSD system is now backlogged and to be patient it will only be a few months.  I was diagnosed by SSI/SD doctors along with my physical impairments I also have severe depression, post traumatic stress syndrome and a few other things. If SSI/SSD doctors say that I am unable to work then WHY? am I slowly loosing everything I have,? I write you as I will be homeless next month. This letter is very hard for me to write, I have worked in the State of FL since age 16 always paid my taxes and the system does not seem to work. I need some medical help to fix me or if permanate as I am told then given some releif and give me proper medical care. I cannot wait a couple of months, I have no husband or any other family support, so tell me Mr Bush in this situation what shall I do?  My education and prior hard work seem to be used against me.  I am not a lazy bum nor am I a drug addict. I am really hurt physically and mentally by this, my life is very hard right now. HOW can you work in the US /FL all of your life be hurt and not receive help, even when SSI/SSD doctors say the same thing I am saying.
 
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me before I am living on the streets! 
 
My home number is Tampa 813-655-3922
 
Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this.. I am sincerely

Subject:	Immigration and Jobs for America - a Joint Development process

Honorable Governor,
 
I have been working in Great State of Florida for over 17 years; have graduated from several of our highly esteemed State of Florida Universities (FSU, FAU) and the University of Miami (MBA International Business). I have worked with many Fortune 500 companies in providing consultation services in the area of Contact Centers - Office Depot, IBM, GTECH, Spirit Airlines, Ocwen, Assurant, TracFone, and State of Florida Technology Office.  A trend of major concern has been taking place over the past few years to off shore contact center agents to the Philippines, India, South America and other foreign countries due the inherently cheaper labor costs.  This trend represents a sound business decision by the owners of these enterprises given the current costs of labor, government incentives, laws and the advent of newer and cheaper transport technologies.
 
Undoubtedly, this trend started many years prior to 2000 as these countries have been re-tooling their workers to become knowledge workers. The skills of English Language, Computer Literacy, and Cultural Training are not learned over night, they are results of pro-active attempts by competing governments to seize an economic strong hold to employ their workers. Examples of Tax Benefits, waived Import Duties etc are all part of these governments war chest on the Economics of employing their constituents. 
 
As a technologist with ambitions to serve my community, I met you briefly at the Miami Seaport as part of the DR-CAFTA discussions where you had the honor of hosting three presidents from South & Central America. Our friend, Jorge Arrizurieta was also a key speaker at the Biltmore. Key to their lectures was joint economic prosperity. 
 
Currently, technology exists, and is exploited, to allow off shoring and near shoring of Contact Center Agents - robbing the economic benefit to the local U.S. economies. Major organizations utilize this technology to employ two to three thousand agents per company outside of U.S Governments jurisdiction, taxes and regulations. Under a level playing field, I am typically opposed to government interference and support a laissez-faire state of affairs. I can however argue that the situation is not fair due to outside influences of Government incentives and that the foundation of the U.S. Service Economy is at jeopardy. It is at jeopardy as consumers no longer visit businesses face to face but conducts transactions via the telephone, Internet, email and Interactive Voice Response systems. And as such, these services have shifted to off shore locations in major proportions. The U.S used to be an industrial nation but we gave this leadership to China and Japan and moved to the Service Economy model. Although this is part of the natural order of economic theory, I am not quite sure how we intend to grow this segment if the services are in fact supplied outside of the U.S. What I do see is an economic windfall for competing governments and more and more U.S. Workers being displaced.
 
I offer a solution that is both fair and reciprocal in nature and that I bequest to get your thoughts and support to begin an endeavor that brings the end result of Economic Prosperity and cultural exchange to participating governments. I have simplified my thoughts in the following paragraph as a starting point in dialogue with you and other U.S. leaders and to gain your support of such a solution. After more meaningful discussions we could more clearly define this strategy to one that is both acceptable and embraced by policy makers in the U.S and your constituents.  
 
The main principle behind the program is to bring foreign workers to the U.S to curtail the contact center gold rush on foreign soil. Bringing these workers to U.S Shores in a temporary fashion for Training, Employment and Worker exchange would have multiple effects on the economic prosperity of both nations. The program could be structured such that in exchange for financial incentives via public and private sources, a percentage of the total contact center work force would have to be U.S Based (preferably Florida). Further more a sub set of these workers in the US would in fact be also required to be from the foreign countries. Work Permits would be given to these companies for a fixed term limit that would bring workers to the U.S. to work at wages commensurable with US Wages. This would allow the workers to learn U.S Culture, be taxed by U.S and provide economic growth at the local areas. US workers would naturally rise to positions of leaderships within the U.S. based contact center due to longevity and the Foreign workers would benefit economically, intellectually and culturally.
 
I think that some of the same issues we face with our current H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 and the proposed guest worker program would be challenged with this program. However, due to a solid reciprocal economic approach, we would perhaps gain support on both sides do the fence and would in fact be an impetus for Presidents Bush Guest Worker Program.
 
Alexander the Great, King of Macedon understood the "policy of fusion" in building his empire. As a cause and effect reaction, U.S Relations with participating governments would steadily establish stronger bonds. Foreign workers would become spokesman for U.S labor practices and ideas of democracy and freedom would ring prominently through out the world. An epidemic of prosperity could be started that is supportive of joint economic prosperity.
 
Although I have over simplified the idea to keep this note short and to the point, I would like to spend some time with you and others to discuss your thoughts and to begin to rally support for such a program. Please provide me some time on your calendar. I am available at your command.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

First of all I am we will miss you when your term ends. Now for the letter.

 

We are having a huge dilemma and don’t know where to turn. My wife Alejandra has applied for residency in the US around Oct 2004, we have already been through all the INS red tape, and have even gotten as far as our interview as a married couple on March 23, 2006. At that point we were told that we should be receiving correspondence from the INS within days for her to come down and have her passport stamped as a resident. 

 

Needless to say 30 days came and went with nothing, so we contacted INS and were told that they had no answer yet. We were very perplexed since after the interview we were told that we would get the residency card in the mail. We contacted our immigration attorney and after he inquired were told that she was selected for a random background check and that there was no time frame on how long that would take.

 

Well here is where we really need your help. Alejandra’s mother is 68 and was staying with us for vacation began to feel some pain in her hip; she was taken to the Dr. who diagnosed her with a broken hip. She immediately returned to Colombia so that she could have surgery preformed, and was told by her Dr’s that she has a tumor around her hip and that they would have to remove it before they could even begin to mend her hip and that she would require assistance with her recovery.

 

Needless to say my wife who is an only child who would like to be with, and help her mother who herself has no one who can help her in Colombia since she is a widow. Of course my wife may not leave the country because her case is still pending with INS, and her attorney strongly advised her against filing an I-131 for advance parole, because he said that it may have an adverse reaction on her return. His understanding is that the file is in "investigation" and there is no idea when the file will be complete. THIS IS LUDACRIS, it has been well over 6 months since our interview was completed and two years since the petition was files. How long does it take for the USCIS to review and close a file?

 

Is there any, or do you know ANYONE that we can appeal to help get this case moved forward? My wife Alejandra would like nothing more then to be able to be with her mother in her time of need, and yet some breakdown in the system has put her case an indefinite limbo.

 

Most of these e-mails fall on deaf ears, and as an American Citizen I am embarrassed by the lack of any feelings that the bearcats have. However I will keep on trying to help my wife see her mother before she dies.

 

Thank You,

 

Samuel Newman

any way for me to went in Florida and get a work visa, without
applying at the usually way, at this moment I have tree company's
that would hire me if I have a license to work in Florida, and it´s
frustrating knowing that, they say that my resume is very good, I just

Looking forward to hearing from you soon, I remain

Yours Faithfully

Dear Sir

I am writing to you out of desperation. My husband is a lawyer in South
Africa with a post graduate degree in politics but he does waitering to
try and keep us going!! This is because of the government sponsored
affirmative action program. We have small children and our family is
living in poverty.Our children love America and even display the flag
proudly in their bedroom. Scott`s greatest wish is to come over to
American, do one of the bar exams and find work there. He is desperate to
get us out of here where we fear for our lives, because of violent
crime.It is so bad here, but nothing seems to be done. Nobody really knows
how bad it is.People we know are being murdered and car-jacked all the
time. Can you help? All Scott wants to do ,is work and he cant do it
here.My young daughter who is very talented had to leave school last year
because we could not pay fees. She sits at home. She cant get a bursary
because she is white.Our family is suffering and we want to leave. I
respectfully ask you to help us in any way.WE WANT TO BE AMERICAN CITIZENS
AND BE PART OF A COUNTRY ANYBODY CAN BE PROUD OF.
