I hope you can help or forward this email to the new Charlie Crist (who
my employer worked to collect funds for his campaign-alan Edwards State
Farm Agent)I received a ntoce for official request for information from
the Dept of Revenue for my home.  In June 2004, I added the name of my
daughter to the deed of the house by filing a quit claim deed.  My
daughter is on disability and being one of 3 children, I wanted to avoid
any conflict in the event of my demise.  I have heard horror stories
that people's Broward County  taxes doubled after filing a quite claim
deed.  I hired the attorney who handle the purchase of the home and he
filed the necessary papers he collected the necessary funds but now
advises I could owe more money with a penalty.
All I did was add her name to the deed; no money was exchanged and she
cannot help with the payments and maintenance of the house since her
social security payment is only $944 a month.  This is the reason she is
living with me and I would like her to continue doing so when I pass
away.  I certainly hope you can assist me with this situation.

Subject:	physicians record policy when office closes

I'm not sure which agency would regulate this but...
I was informed by reading an ad in our local newspaper that my doctor was closing his office and I needed to contact his office concerning getting copies of my chart.  
When I called his office I was informed that there was no charge if I go to a Health First Physician but if I want to switch to a doctor of my choice then I would need to pay $1.00 per page for my medical records.
This does not seem fair.  I could understand if I choose to change doctor's but for him to close his office.  I would appreciate any input with this matter.  
The physician is Dr. Ronald Eason, Central Brevard Obstetrics & Gynecology, 150 S. Woods Drive, Rockledge, FL 32955, 321-639-2229.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to voice my displeasure of the proposed new fee of $500 per semester at U of F, which will be classified as non-tuition.
We have paid into the Prepaid Tuition Plan for both our children.  The State encouraged us to do this to lock in tuition rates that would be dramatically higher when our children became college age.  The structure of this new fee as a "fee" instead of an increase in tuition is simply to avoid the benefits to forward thinking families whom have paid into the Florida Prepaid Tuition Plan.  The main reason for the "fee" is to increase faculty and faculty pay which is a direct expense paid for by tuition.  This is very unjust.
 
I hope you will champion efforts to thwart this deceptive and unjust classification of this proposed "fee."
 
Sincerely,
 
Dan and Melva Murphy
 
 
P.S.  You have been an outstanding Governor.

Hi Mr. Bush,

I am writing this e-mail on behalf of my mom and I, seeking your assistance. 
My mother and I reside in Orlando Florida, we are both Native floridians. My 
mother and I moved to Orlando a year and about six months ago because I was 
accepted into the Nursing program here. I am in my senior year and have a 
semester and a few more weeks to go before I graduate. My mom has been most 
instrumental in me continuing my education. She has contributed alot to get 
me where I am.
As you know as a second degree seeking student you are limited to the types 
of financial aid that is available to you. Since coming back to school it 
has been quite expensive and consequently financially draining. We had been 
doing well until financially everything snowballed into what it has become 
today. This semester I received just enough to cover tuition and nothing 
else. I have a part time job and my mom is on a fixed income. My mom has 
given her all. Because nursing school is very demanding I have had to cut 
down on my hours at work.  I tried to get assistance with rent so that I 
could keep a roof over our heads but every place that I called required us 
to have a child before they would help. My mother is a Senior Citizen, she 
is 66 years old, she is a veteran and unable to work. We have been evicted 
from our apartment because we weren't able to pay the rent. We have never 
been evicted from anywhere and have never been homeless. I tried to get us a 
place to lay our heads at night at the local shelters but they either 
provide shelter for women and children or they are overcrowded. I have 
contacted HUD and other Senior programs to get my mom senior housing but 
they state that they have waiting lists going back two to three years. I 
desperately need your help. My mom is a diabetic and she isn't eating the 
way she should. She is loosing weight and its tough on us both. We are 
presently sleeping in our car. It is cold and unbearable at night. I have 
mentioned my predicament to others and have even gone to a church to seek 
help. It brings heartache to know that I pay taxes and have given to 
charities and when I have need, I can't get any help. We are both honest, 
decent people, I am a College student living on the streets trying to finish 
my education with my mom who is sick. I need you to please make a way that 
at least my mom can find senior housing somewhere As soon as possible.  I 
can't even afford to keep my cell phone on, so the only way for you or your 
staff to contact me is by e-mail. I feel really bad having to be in this 
predicament and equally bad having to beg others for help, but I am 
desperately trying to complete school so that I can build a stable future 
for me and my mom. Thank you sincerly for reading this e-mail and I hope to 
hear from you soon.

Sincerly,

Mrs. Yvonne Banks
and Daughter Katrina Banks

I have a Special Needs Daughter who received SSI when she was real young and 
even though she still has the same disability she qualified with back then 
she can't get any help now.  She is 18 years of age and is supposed to be 
considered an adult with headhold of 1 regardless of where she resides.  Her 
SSI was canceled back in the late 1990's because of my earnings (mom) and 
the child support received from her father.  Because of this we started a 
Mutual Fund for her should anything happen to her parents (who are presently 
60 years of age) and it would be a start for whomever was looking out for 
her until the time benefits could be restarted.  Now it turns out that the 
mutual fund is her downfall.  One would think that a fund for this purpose 
would be not the deciding factor of her again receiving the help she so 
deserves.  The state of Florida has interpreted the child support obligation 
and deemed it not necessary anymore even though she is still in high school. 
In fact we pulled her out of public school three years ago and utilized the 
McKay Scholarship and did homeschooling accompanied with tutoring and 
assisted her thru Level Three, Four and into Level Five before this year 
re-enrolling her in the public school system as a Ninth Grader which means 
she can still complete her four years of high school.  Talk about a child 
falling between the cracks!!!  No Child Left Behind does not mean anything 
when a student is an ESE student all of their school years.  They are Left 
Behind from the Beginning and continue that way throughout their school 
years.  I truly believe that my daughter has the capability to be 
self-sufficient some day given the opportunity to do such.  She needs to 
find the "edge for her individual learning ability" to be pursued and then 
utilize her abilities to the best she possibly can.

I checked the link to the web site in the first paragragh and was 
unsuccessful in locating anything about what was mentioned.  We live in 
Auburndale, which happens to be really close to Lakeland where mention is 
made of a center.

Subject:	Child Support Enforcement

Mr. Bush,

 

It is with deep regret that I must contact you again regarding my child support case # [REDACTED].  I am the custodial parent of Bryan Bush and am having no luck with enforcement of my child support case.  Enforcement of my case has been previously delayed due to the automated enforcement system.  Since that time, I have waited patiently and all automated forms of enforcement have been completed.  Tallahassee has requested the local office to proceed with a court date to find the non-custodial parent in contempt-of-court.  Per my conversation with the Tallahassee today, the case worker (Ed Cason) still has not responded to Tallahassee's request. 

 

I myself have personally contacted Mr. Cason (and Lynn Davis) regarding enforcement and have concerns regarding Mr. Cason's disposition.  My first concern was the manner is which he addressed the monies owed.  I was advised by Mr. Cason it wasn't "but just $2,100" at the time I made the call.  I advised Mr. Cason this wasn't including the arrearage which now totals to date $4,400.  For many (including Mr. Cason), this may not seem like much.  But for me and my son, we need every penny just to survive.  

 

My second reason for concern is Mr. Cason's defense of Mr. Henderson (the non-custodial parent).  Per Mr. Cason, Mr. Henderson isn't working and can't make the child support payment based on a telephone call his office had with Mr. Henderson.  Mr. Henderson advised he was in a vehicle accident and is disabled.  However, disability hasn't been filed nor has there been any proof of such accident or inability to pay the child support.  Regardless, I find it highly unlike that he can't pay the child support since the State of Florida has evidence that he owns several of his own businesses in which he receives income.    

 

I questioned Mr. Cason regarding the request for suspension of Mr. Henderson's drivers' license, but have also had no luck in this area of enforcement.  Although Mr. Caso did state his office advised Mr. Henderson he could file an affidavit with the court to keep from having his license suspended since he needed them to work (but yet he's disabled and unable to pay child support).  My last call to Mr. Cason's office resulted in Mr. Cason placing me on hold and never returning to my call.  Nor has he made any attempt to call me back.

 

I also want to make you are that the State is aware of Mr. Henderson's threats of non-payment and physical threats in 2005 if I did not drop my request to have the State re-evaluate the amount of child support to be paid.  The State is also aware that Mr. Henderson has been active throughout his community including coaching little league baseball and is not disabled as reported.  The State is aware of the denial to have a "change of venue" to the county in which my son and I have resided for many years so that Mr. Henderson may receive preferential treatment through his local, rural county judge (Judge Land) even though I objected to Judge Land residing over the case due to his "personal" relationship with Mr. Henderson in which the judge admitted in court.  And the State is also aware that Judge Land failed to order the amount of child support due my child based on Mr. Henderson's income due to the preferential treatment received in Lafayette County. 

 

Mr. Bush, can you please help me to help support my child?  My child and I are struggling to get by.  Unfortunately for the past year, I've had to work longer hours just to provide for my child.  I do not qualify for assistance through the State such as AFDC or Food Stamps because I do work.  The only help I'm requesting is to enforce the non-custodial parent (William "Bill" Henderson) to help me support my child (which he chooses to ignore even exists).

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Gov. Jeb Bush,
 In 1993 or 1994 I went to the Sherrif and told them some things that I 
knew. I left their office discouraged because I don't think they believed 
me, or maybe they thought I was crazy. I had information about a serial 
rapist in Oklahoma who stole his neigbors wallet, left the wallet at the 
crime scene and the innocent man was sentenced to prison, who recently was 
released after serving about 8 years. 
 This same rapist was visiting his father in Tallahassee Florida from 
about June 1990 until February 1991. I have not any evidence but I have 
many reasons to suspect that it was someone other than Danny Rolling who 
committed those murders in Gainesville. I don't really care what happens 
to Danny, but we surely don't want to execute the wrong man. I care about 
the lives and well being of innocent victims, yet the authorities get the 
wrong guy. 
 If you want to hear my story, please let me know. I just don't want to 
feel like I could have prevented something unecessary if only I had said 
something. 

Sincerely,

Mr. Bush,

     Parents of Florida have some big concerns about FCAT! There are students out there who are "A" honor roll students but, cannot pass FCAT! This is unfair to those students who work hard for passing grades but, just can't pass FCAT. Should these students not be able to pass 3rd grade or graduate? Why can't we have FCAT to see how our students and schools are doing but, not penalized the children for it?
I have 2 children one who is a senior. My senior just passed FCAT last year and I had to talk him out of dropping out and giving up on himself, thanks to FCAT!
What could you do to help with this situation, how could us parents start a petition?
Trust me there are lots of parents who agree with changing fcat or just getting rid of it!

Governor Bush,

 

Last Friday, Mrs. Jeannie Baker spoke with you during the 100ideas.org conference in Orlando, regarding my son, Matthew Alfano.  Thank you for your offer to consider the clemency process in my son’s case.  Here is the information that you asked for to pass on to your clemency attorney, Vicki Brennan.  

 

Name:    Matthew David Alfano

Address: 5412 Spring Run Ave.

              Orlando, FL  32819

SS#        [REDACTED]

DOB:     8/29/1983

 

Age at time of Offense: 20

Date of Offense: June 12, 2004

Court Case # 2004-CF-001719-A-02 (Lake County, FL)

Charge: Lewd/Lascivious Battery on Child over 12 YOA but less than16 YOA

 

As Ms. Baker explained, my son served for a year in Baghdad, Iraq with the Fl Army National Guard.  Just after returning home, he became romantically involved in a consensual relationship with a 15 year old girl who he had known for several years.  The young lady’s mother became irate when she discovered the relationship and pressed charges against my son. After two years in the court system, the case was settled with a plea bargain.  He pled no contest and adjudification was withheld.  He received a 10 year suspended sentence with 7 years of Sex Offender probation.  He is now a registered as a Sex Offender, a label which will last his lifetime.

 

My son realizes this relationship was wrong.  He has no excuse for his behavior and is accepts responsibility for his actions.  Sadly, the law today makes no distinction between a true sexual predator, and a young man like my son who let romance lead him to a gross error in judgment.  As I’m sure you understand, the designation as a Sex Offender restricts his ability to get a respectable job, it restricts where he can live, where he can go, and requires Sex Offender counseling for problems he doesn’t have.  It restricts his life to the point that it is very difficult for him to be a productive member of society.  Instead, it sets him up for failure.  

 

I sincerely appreciate the interest that you took in my son’s case.  Your ability to see the human side to situations, and your understanding that legislation doesn’t always turn out the way we planned is clear in the way you have governed.  Thank you so much for offering to begin the process for granting him clemency.  I have attached a complete explanation of the events that occurred, if you have the time, I ask that you please read it.  I know you understand how it feels to have a young adult child in trouble and I truly appreciate your willingness to reach out to us during this time.  Please let me know if you need any other information.  My son and I look forward to talking to Ms. Brennan and again appreciate your help in this matter.

Mr. Bush,
                I am requesting a meeting with your office. I have been in battle with IRS for years now. They put a lien/ levy on my family since 1993 .I have went to Connie Mack's office in Ft. Myers, Florida and have them working with me. I called Mr. Mack's office again today 9-27-2006 to let them know IRS is taking my husbands paycheck again therefore We will not be able to pay our bills and feed our kids again. Was supposed to receive a call back for they were contacting IRS again. I showed his office all of my Tax Returns proving we have never owed Taxes. IRS in Ft. Myers has stamped my returns Received for they are the ones that went through all the way to 1993 Taxes. My Family is about to loose everything because IRS has took all of our money by closing our checking account and my husbands paychecks again. I have it in writing from IRS in Ft. Myers that we have never owed money. To this day IRS still has not cleared the paper work they received years ago. I have proof  IRS in Ft. Myers personally mailed it and faxed it on numerous occasions. I too kept receipts where I have sent it by certified mail and also faxing all info to them.
I called Mrs. Ronell  I. D. # 89-11090 upon receiving another Notice of Levy. Phone # 1-800-829-7650 ACS Support Office. She said if I Fax the paperwork to her at 559-456-5677 that she was putting a hold on the Levy until she was able to go through them and put them in computer. This was faxed to her 9-19-2006. She informed me that they were still showing nothing mailed or faxes on our 1993 or 1994 returns. She wanted me to call her back if I haven't heard from her by 11-12-2006. How can I when you never speak to the same person even when you have their Name and I. D. #.How is this when IRS in Ft. Myers mailed and Faxed it to them 4-9-2002, 9-3-2002,10-31-2002, 2-8-2003,. Since 2002 I have sent copies to them to be processed. Here it is 2006 and the Job still is not done. I know it shouldn't take this long and they should not be stealing our money. Someone needs to make IRS do their JOB. They have had more than enough time to process it. I was told our info was backed out of the system for some reason not known. Isn't that illegal? Ft. Myers office had already put all of our info in their computers when they did all of the work for us.This was done by Mrs. Karen Russell 65-04645 and Joe Denoe.
On 5-11-2006 IRS in Ft. Myers faxed to MR. Covin Reconsideration Unit ATSC Atlanta Ga fax # 239-938-7596. I have personally talked with over 13 people over this issue. I even had IRS in Ft. Myers print out papers from their computer to contacts and remarks. Please contact me on this issue or set an appointment to meet with me. I will get there some how. Phone # is 239-898-9610.

Dear Gov Bush,
Two years ago it was discovered that Councilman Mickey Rosado of Cape Coral lied about his education during his election campaign. He pleaded no contest. At that time I asked you to exercise your power to remove him from office. You declined. As expected his lack of integrity has reared its head once again. This time it is with land deals. His duties as a councilman place him in an untenable conflict of interest that he seems to cavalierly ignore. Please at least initiate an investigation of his activities. Ethics in government, even local government, is paramount in our democracy.     Jim Harvey Cape Coral

GOVENOR BUSH-------
 
The death yesterday October 28th of Deputy Matt Williams brought back all the emotion of the death of my brother-in-law Florida Highway Trooper Jeffrey D. Young. Jeff was killed by Daniel Burns in 1987 so we know what Deputy Williams family is going through. His family will never get over what has happened to him. When someone's life has ended so suddenly its hard to go on each day and in our case its even harder as the killer is still sitting on death row. I know it sounds awful but I am glad this one today never came out of the woods alive.
 
How much longer do we have to wait for Daniel Burns to be put to death?????He was found guilty and sentenced to death. Jeff's Mom did not live long enough to see justice but we are hoping we will. Please when his death warrant comes to your desk please, please sign it and let get this job done. I am afraid if we wait any longer, it will never be done. Burns has not deserved to have 3 meals a day and a roof over his head for almost 20 years. We deserve to have closure on this.
 
Thank you for your time,

Subject:	Do Not Execute Danny Rolling!

I wish to appeal to you on behalf of DANNY ROLLING, who is due to be executed on October 25.  My sympathies go out to the family and loved ones of Christina Powell, Sonja Larson, Christa Hoyt, Manuel Tobada and Tracy Paules, and I agree this was a very tragic event that cannot go unpunished. However, the death penalty—which only serves to create more victims and perpetuate a cycle of violence—is not the right punishment for DANNY ROLLING. 

While these crimes are heinous and inexcusable, the death penalty is not the right choice for Danny Rolling.  Rolling grew up in a dysfunctional household with an abusive father.  Furthermore, he suffered from emotional and psychological problems, as noted in one appellate judge’s opinion of his sentencing.  Rolling pleaded guilty in his 1994 trial, where it was established that at the times of his crimes, he had the emotional maturity of a 15-year-old and that he suffered from extreme emotional disturbance.

Executing DANNY ROLLING would violate the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and constitute the ultimate cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.  Please find it in your heart to spare the life of this human being.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this important and urgent matter.

Sir, my name is CW3 Gavin Glasenapp and I am an AH-64D Apache pilot with 2/159th Aviation, stationed in Illesheim, Germany.  A great friend and fellow Apache pilot, CW3 Timothy Breneman, passed away here last week in an aircraft crash.  Tim was well known and well respected in our unit and beyond.  His contributions both as an aviator, soldier, and patriot impacted many lives.  CW3 Breneman was both born and raised in Florida, and his surviving mother and father live in Ormond to this day.  I have been assigned as Tim's casualty assistance officer, helping both his surviving spouse, Teresa Phelps, and his parents deal with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.  I am writing to ask if yourself and some other member of your state's legislature could make some sort of attendance at his funeral in Arlington, Virginia.  If this is not at all possible, a letter from your office would be greatly appreciated by the surviving family members.  

I can be reached at my e-mail address:  gavin.w.glasenapp@us.army.mil

I also can be reached by phone here in Germany:  4916091527862

Subject:	A pardon for my son

  
Dear Governer Bush;
 
I am sure you recieve this request hundreds of time a week.  I do not know the correct way to submit this so I am starting this way.
 
My son was arrested in May. His charge was Solicit/entice a minor to engage in sex crime via the internet. My son thought he was talking to a 15 year old. It was a deputy.  He on several occasions cut off communication with the "girl".  The deputy spent four months trying to get my son to commit to a meeting.  When he did he was arrested.. He made many mistakes but does not deserve to be a felon and registered sex offender for his mistake.  He is in no way a threat to any child.  But will be looked at as the scum of the earth, and  discriminated against for the rest of his life.   Thank you for taking the time for reading this and for any help that can be given to him. 
 
 It was very hard to watch him stand in front of a judge and accept a plea when he hurt no one.  Tomorrow he has to go register with the Sheriff's office and DMV as a sex offender.
 
I know there are many people in the world that would hurt a child, but my son is not one of the.  He has never been any trouble or hurt any
one.
 
He was one of the children that were left behind, before your program with the schools.  He was in 8th grade before he was found to have a learning disability that had caused and still causes him problems.  Now he has something else to deal with.
 
Thank you again,  Alice Patton

Subject:	Good News Story: Exemplary Florida Citizen & LCDR Deserves Recognition for Humanitarian Acts In Afghanistan

Hello Governor Bush, 

 

I think I came across a story yesterday that you’ll want to know about, if you don’t already. Your trips overseas to visit troops are famous, and both your actions and words show you care deeply about the morale and success of our soldiers.  Well, yesterday I came across a good news story about Floridians among our troops in Afghanistan that need our help. 

 

In the past, I have had the good fortune to be able to participate in the Any Soldier program, where members of the general public can support our troops overseas with letters, supplies, and morale boosters.  But, yesterday I learned about humanitarian requests from one our fellow Floridians and a UF grad (go Gators!), LCDR Sheldon A. Chatman.  LCDR Chatman, who is stationed in Khowst, Afghanistan, has given up the opportunity to request creature comforts on the Any Soldier web site for his own troops’ behalf, and instead is using this platform to request supplies that will serve the humanitarian needs of the community around their base.  

 

Although I’ve never met this sailor, his actions are clearly heroic.  His Florida based group of 20 sailors seem to be on the forefront of being able to single-handedly change perceptions of the Afghan people about America.  My staff and I are already putting together some care packages that he requested to help the local children have shoes in time for winter.  

 

But, this sailor deserves recognition by our State, and the citizens of our great State deserve to hear more stories about exemplary Floridians who are making a difference in the world.  What will be more important to him, I believe, is help with three deathly ill Afghan children that were brought to him for medical assistance.  Although I am also contacting friends who are physicians who may be able to suggest some alternatives, I wanted to send email to you as the Governor, who may be able to bring the power of the State to more quickly address the urgent health needs of these three children.  

 

I’ve never written to any of my elected officials, but this is a good reason to start.  I am more than willing to do anything I can to assist.  I’m thanking you in advance for any advice, leads, or any recognition that you can offer LCDR Sheldon A. Chatman, as an outstanding example of humanitarianism and what being a proud Florida citizen is all about.  

 

Here’s the link to the Any Soldier Site: http://anysoldier.com/WhereToSend/

Search Florida, and you will find the link for: LCDR Sheldon A. Chatman

Gov. Bush,
 
Sir, I'm a naturalized citizen (originally from Ireland) and have been a resident of Brevard County with my wife, a U.S. Navy Lt., for the past three years.
 
I know your eight-year term is coming to a close in the next few months, and I would like to ask if you would consider an interview with a weekly newspaper, such as the Hometown News.
 
My idea would be to interview you on your experiences and memories from the last eight years and allow more than 500,000 readers up and down the east coast of Florida an opportunity to learn a little bit more about the man behind the title.
 
Gov. Bush, you can find some of my recent articles at the Web site listed below, and I would consider it an honor to have the chance to sit down and talk to you.

Dear Govenor Bush  I'm writing out of desperation about my nephew who is currently in East Putnam Correctional institution for  a sentence of attempted robbery with possesion of a fire arm while High on drugs.He was given a ten year sentence with I guess no chance of parole or release on good behavior for 10 years.I feel this is a huge injustice and that it should be looked into  because he is a great young man and deserves a second chance.I'm aware that your own daughter had difficulties with drug use so I know you understand this.I'm not saying my nephew isn't guilty but I do feel that he shouldn't waste away in this facility that does nothing to  encourage growth or rehabilitation for the 10 years.He is a model inmate and I'm asking you to look into his case and possibly before you leave office change his sentence to 5years or God willing give him a pardon and let our family have him back.I know he has changed and is free of drug use and plans to never return to that lifestyle ever again.We want him to  get this chance because he really deserves this, so does my sister and her husband  who have gone thru Hell and back regarding this decision he made.Our family will help and nurture him back to a productive life if given the chance.Please really consider this .I am not a Florida resident but do reside in Dallas Texas.I'ved loved your family  ever since your dad was President.I have meet both your parents and brother Neal thru Kick Start and  hope someday to meet you when you come to Texas to see your family and possibly attend the Houston KickStart event held every April.Thankyou for reading this and please do consider doing a great thing for someone  who needs a second chance.

Governor,

 

I have written before regarding this topic, and I feel it is time to write again. What you are pushing on Jacksonville is wrong. There are people who bought into the Westside of Jacksonville and Clay County for the peace, quiet, and wide open spaces, as well as the affordability of the area. You are pushing this jet base down our throats in the name of patriotism, although the Navy is on record as wanting to stay in Oceana. You went before the BRAC 2005 Commission with Mayor Peyton with outdated maps and ignored the responsibility of doing your due diligence. I would go as far as to say that you perjured yourself by the extent of your misrepresentation of the true facts regarding the homes, schools, and churches that would be negatively impacted if the jets were to return to Cecil Commerce Center (which you stated was an economic jewel, and is one of Florida’s last megasites to attract big businesses). Your grossly inflated West Florida Impact Study has even been disproved by Virginia’s own economists.

Enough is enough. The last year and a half of my life has been spent standing up for my property rights. I moved into my home in April 2005. In June I found out about your intention to put the East Coast Master jet base in my backyard. Instead of enjoying my new home and my family, my little boy has had to sacrifice a good deal of time with me while I have done extensive research and lobbying to protect our home from your dogged pursuit of political pork.

I know what my rights are. I will pursue legal action with hundreds of others if your plan comes to fruition. Leaving hundreds of lawsuits in your wake will not be how you will want to be remembered when you leave office, I imagine. 

Please let those of us who live around Cecil live in peace. If you only knew how many people you have negatively affected by bringing this upon us. It has been the worst year in many of our lives. Please leave it alone.

 

Sincerely,

He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to 6 months probation on January 17th,2006. He quickly filed a motion for "unsupervised visitation " with the children and to have his guns back in May. The Judge denied his unsupervised visitation because of the fear my children have of him, yet granted his weapons be returned. In the divorce agreement, I was led to believe that I was protected from him by him agreeing to a "Permanent Injunction" and agreed to him having his guns back, believing that the Judge would not allow it as if you have an injunction against you, you are not allowed weapons...I believed I was safe.  I found out that the "permanent Injunction" he agreed to was not worth the paper it was written on, not legally enforceable, and he got all of his guns back. He was awarded supervised visitation every other week for an hour and a half. He canceled the appointments with the children and therapist stating "inconvenience".  He has threatened me, found out my previous address, employment, and formed a friendship with a fellow employee that worked with me to give him information about me and my children, and to pass "messages"to me and stated " I will make your life miserable once I receive unsupervised visitation." We fled the state of Florida, left good paying jobs,a home we were buying, family and friends, in fear of our lives and the life of my unborn child. He was watching us, just two days after we fled, he had a third party call my Mom,pretending to be a school board officer demanding to know where we were, she was intimidated and told them. He had previously beat me so badly that I miscarried. He now is seeking full custody and asking I be the one with supervised visitation, stating I am the one with mental issues...he continues to mentally abuse and attempt to control us...using the court system. I have no where else to turn...

RECORD NUMBER OF FLORIDA STUDENTS TAKING SAT AND AP EXAMS

On Tuesday, Education Commissioner John L. Winn joined me in announcing
record numbers of Florida students are taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) and Advanced Placement (AP) exams.  A record-breaking 94,601, or 63
percent, of Florida's 2006 high school graduates took the SAT.
Additionally, Florida saw the greatest increase in public school AP
exam-takers compared to all other states from 2005 to 2006.  Through our
partnership with the College Board and the new reforms in the A++ Plan for
Education, we are preparing students for success during and following high
school.  For more details, please visit www.fldoe.org.


SPACE FLORIDA NAMES PRESIDENT

On Wednesday, I chaired a meeting of the Space Florida Board of Directors
where we named Steve Kohler president of Space Florida.  In a unanimous
vote, the board ratified the selection of Kohler as Space Florida's first
president and charged him with strengthening, diversifying and expanding
Florida's role as a global leader in space and aeronautics.  Steve's
leadership will be a tremendous asset to Space Florida as the organization
leads the state's efforts to continue attracting aerospace businesses that
create quality, high paying jobs for Floridians.  Growing Florida's economy
through the space and aerospace industries is critical to the state's
long-term prosperity.  For more information, please visit

GOVERNOR BUSH PROMOTES JOBS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

On Thursday, I was joined in Jacksonville by area leaders and members of the
First Coast Business Leadership Network to launch a campaign encouraging
employers to recruit and hire qualified individuals with disabilities.
Florida's growing economy and job market should be open to the largest
minority group in our state - persons with disabilities.  By fostering
employment opportunities, we can empower persons with disabilities to live
the American dream. For more information on hiring qualified workers with
disabilities or joining the First Coast Business Leadership Network, visit
www.apd.myflorida.com or www.MyAbilities.org. 


COLLEGE BOARD'S NEW "EXCELerator" PROGRAM APPLAUDED

Also on Thursday, I applauded the College Board's national education reform
efforts to ensure more students graduate from high school ready for college
and the workforce.  The College Board announced that Duval County was
selected as one of the first school districts in the nation to participate
in the innovative "EXCELerator" Schools program.  Through a $16 million
investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the College Board will
complement its promising school development efforts in New York with the new
program in 11 high schools in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Duval County.
Four Duval County schools have been selected to participate, including
Samuel Wolfson, Terry Parker, Sandalwood and Robert E. Lee High Schools. For
more information, please visit, www.myflorida.com or www.collegeboard.com.


ASSISTANCE FOR FLORIDA'S SEVERELY INJURED VETERANS

On Friday, I announced the start of a pilot program which provides the state
with timely veteran contact information from the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA), allowing the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs (FDVA) to
reach out to severely injured servicemembers inbound for treatment at a
Florida-based VA facility.  The program allows VA staff members assigned to
Department of Defense medical facilities to contact injured servicemembers
headed to VA treatment facilities in Florida, and provide an opportunity for
them to authorize contact by FDVA representatives.  For information on FDVA
and benefits offered to Florida veterans, log on to www.FloridaVets.org.

Dear Governor Bush:  
 
I am writing in support of County Court Judge Dorothy Vaccaro's nomination to the circuit court bench in the Sixth Judicial Circuit.  I have practiced law in the Sixth Circuit for almost twenty years.  I have known Dorothy, both personally and professionally, for fifteen of those years.  I first met her when she was an Assistant State Attorney and I was an Assistant Public Defender in New Port Richey, Florida, where we regularly worked on opposite sides of the aisle, so to speak.  I found her then and I find her now to be conscientious, clever, dedicated, organized, consistent, and fair.  
 
Dorothy has been a county court judge for over four years and has mastered the job with good humor and grace.  She would be an asset to the circuit court bench just as she currently is to the county court bench.  I cannot speak highly enough about her.  She has personal and professional integrity which is, perhaps, the most important attribute a person can possess.  I recommend her without reservation.  
 
Sincerely,

Subject: RE: Insurance price gouging ?



Thank you for your letter about property insurance.  

 

Insurance is the number one issue facing our state today.  Two unprecedented back-to-back hurricane seasons – with eight hurricanes and four tropical storms – caused $36 billion in insurance claims.  According to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, annual insured losses in years without a major storm average $2.8 billion.

 

Predictions of more catastrophic hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. have triggered significant increases in insurance premiums to cover potential future losses.  Many insurance companies have dropped policies and restricted new policies to avoid high risk areas and reduce overall exposure in Florida.  Homeowners who cannot get private insurance have only two options, no insurance or insurance from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, which has the highest rates in the state.

 

This is a serious situation.  Higher rates and the inability to get private insurance have created a significant hardship for many homeowners and small businesses. Moreover, Florida cannot maintain a robust economy and high quality of life if our state continues to sustain tens of billions of dollars in damage every year.  

 

The key to solving the problem is fortifying Florida against the potential damage of future storms.   Reducing the risk of damage will reduce estimated cost of future disasters, which should stabilize rising insurance premiums.

 

You can take steps today to protect your home and reduce your insurance premium.  Florida requires insurance companies to give a discount on insurance premiums – as much as 44% on your wind policy – for certain improvements that guard against wind damage.  Choosing a higher insurance deductible, either 2% or 5%, can also reduce your premium.  

 

To help homeowners make these improvements, the state is providing $250 million for the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program, a new program to perform free home inspections and provide matching grants to qualified homeowners who harden their homes against wind damage.  Qualified homeowners that make approved improvements to their primary residences may be eligible for reimbursement by the state, dollar-for-dollar up to $5,000.  Qualified low-income homeowners may be eligible for up to $5,000 in improvements without providing any matching funding.  The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program is managed by the Department of Financial Services.  For information about how to apply for the grant, please visit www.mysafefloridahome.com.     

 

To provide immediate relief to policyholders, the state provided $715 million to Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to offset the company’s deficit and reduce the surcharge assessed on all policyholders – not just those with coverage from Citizens.  Without this funding, your insurance policy would have increased an additional $172.48 for every $1,000 of your insurance premium.

 

To increase the availability of private insurance, the state is providing $250 million for a new Insurance Capital Build-up Incentive Program to provide matching funds for insurance companies bringing new capital to the market.  This program will enable private insurance companies to underwrite more policies.  

 

On August 8, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings held the first meeting of the Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee.  This committee is open to all ideas to bring down the cost of premiums, increase availability of affordable insurance and reduce the risk to homeowners and taxpayers.  If you would like to make a suggestion, please visit www.myfloridainsurancereform.com. 

 

Thank you again for your letter.  I am committed to finding a solution to ease the financial burden that you and many other Florida homeowners are facing with the rising cost and declining availability of insurance.

 

                                                            Sincerely,

Governor Bush,
 
I have recently received my home owners insurance policy renewal.  As expected, the premiums went up drastically !  However, the one piece of the puzzle that I have is not with regards to hurricane coverage it deals with all other coverage.  I understand that wind storn had to go up to cover the hurricane damage.  But, why did my other perils premium go from about $1000.00 to $2600 ???  
 
Is the insurance commission looking into the breakdown of rates ?  I think other peril coverage should not have gone up %150 !   I think the Attorney General should be looking into this issue  !

Dear Jeb Bush,


Your honor, My name is Pheap Born. I'm writing you this letter to ask you for a pardon, if it possible. I came from Califonia in 1996 and live here ever since. I'm having problems because of my criminal record from Califonia in 1998 of domestic violence. I became a subsitute teacher in Duval county and was going to become a teacher to help others. I got my Bachlor of sciences in Computer Information Systems from Jones College. Society has not given me another chance to redeem myself. During the new school year of 2006 I was deactivated as a subsitude teacher because they fear that I will do harm because of my past record of that one incident. I was married and now divorced because I cannot support my family with a $8.00 per hour job at Mcdonalds. Bellsouth, Rentway, and Duval County schools turn me away after they see my domestic violence. I look up trying to expunge it in your state of Florida, but it is a violence offense and cannot be expunge or seal only pardon. I'm seeking your pardon because I want to make a difference in the communtiy and help so much other that need my help. I'm limited to what I can do now because of that. I made just that one mistake and now still paying for it. I have never hit or touched another soul since then. I was forgiven by my first ex-wife whom I got the record from. Now I ask you, Jeb Bush if you can pardon me and give me a second chance, sir.

Sincerley,

Pheap Born

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am an attorney of nearly 10 years and had the opportunity to work with Judge Vaccaro at the State Attorney's office in New Port Richey Florida for over 5 years of those years.  Dorothy, as you know was an is an exceptional attorney.  She has now proven herself to be an exceptional Judge as a County Court Judge in Pinellas County.  I have heard from numerous collogues over the years, what an excellent  job Dorothy does on the bench in Pinellas county.  I can speak to her professionalism, her knowledge of the evidence code, court procedure and work ethic directly based on my years working with her at the State Attorney's office in the 6th Judicial Circuit.  
 
May I take this opportunity to, in the strongest possible terms, endorse Judge Vaccaro for the Circuit Court vacancy created when Judge Renke lost his seat in Pasco County.  Judge Vaccaro's reputation in the New Port Richey Courthouse she would be presiding in is stellar.  She is revered by anyone you speak to in our Pasco County community.  Lastly, but most importantly, may I mention that Judge Vaccaro is a wonderful person.  She is loyal, honest and committed to justice, even at her own expense.  I sincerely hope she will be our next Pasco County Circuit Court Judge.
 
Sincerely,

Good Morning,

My name is Anthony Aviles and I am a volunteer for the Young Marines
Program for the state of Florida and also a volunteer for the Vietnam
Veterans of Central Florida (The only War Museum in Central Florida). I am
very interested in having Governor Bush do an appearance on a very important
event the second weekend of November (10,11,12).

The event is a dedication to our falling Veterans during the Vietnam Era
and others who have falling in past wars defending our great country. We
will have a replica of the Vietnam Wall (Traveling Wall) and turn out is
expected to be high.

We would honor the opportunity to have your presence at our event on
either of the dates mentioned above. Hope hearing from you very soon about
your availability.

P.S.
It would also be an honor to have Charlie Crist and Mayor Buddy Dyer attend.

Best Regards
Anthony J. Aviles

Governor Bush,

I would like to thank you for the opportunity to interview with you and
your staff during the recent appointment process for the Public Service
Commission.  I sincerely enjoyed my brief time discussing the issues
with you.  I would also like to convey how impressed I was with Mark and
Janice.  

Throughout this rather unique interview process, it was definitely a
challenge to discuss policy with Council or Committee members with whom
I wasn't sure I saw eye-to-eye on how to address the issues facing
Florida.  However, it was refreshing to sit with your staff, and then
you, and recognize that we were of like mind and I could lay may cards
on the table. 

 As my time in public service may be coming to an end, I also want to
thank you for your leadership during the last eight years.  At every
turn I have supported your initiatives, and you can count on my support
if you decide to run for office in the future.  In fact, I appreciate
the contributions your entire family has made to our nation.  My first
presidential election was your father's, and it seems I have voted for a
Bush in just about every election since then (your father twice, your
brother twice, and you three times).

Again, thank you for your time in the interview, and for you leadership
in our State.

Subject:	[*] Miami-Dade County's unethical user of taxpayer money

 
You know, I have lived in other places other than Miami and continue to be amazed at the arrogance most members of this present County Commission displays.  Time and time again many have shown their lack of represetnation of the people whom they are supposed to represent as well as the ones who ignorantly continue to vote these individuals into office and their representation of vested intersts and their inability to poperly handle the public's money.  Even things for the County's overall good they do not seem to care about unless it lines their pockets or influence.
 
Now, according to THE MIAMI HERALD's Sept. 27 issue, they are using mine and others' taxpayer money to thwart an initiative I and others have as American citizens to take adaventage of, ie. the right to put the issue of a strong mayor on the ballot for our vote.  AGAIN USING OUR MONEY AGAINST OUR INTERESTS!  Obviously many (again with one or two very notable exceptions) of our commisioners have forgotten what country they live in.  Miami is a world class city and it is a shame to see the obvious lack of foresight, honesty, and professionalism most of our Commission members like to display.  Whehter its against an airport authority to run MIA like a true world class facility, or  its residual discoruagement of business to locate here for they know HOW THINGS ARE HERE.  They fail to see the messages teh public send them, especailly over the pay raise issue and the fact that with all their perks, they already are earning  what they are asking for.  Many times tehrie arguments agaisnt a strongg mayor, or on issue such as the airport, I will hear "We are teh ones the pubvlic entrusts their interstes to.  Well who the heck is Mayopr Alvarexz, or any otehr mayor?  THisd commission is completely awash intheir own lies and self perceptions.
 
To our ethics commission, is it right and proper to use our money in this fashion?  To our governenor, if ever there was a time to remove people form their posts, this certainly seems to be it.  If this is the best Miami-Dade County can produce in terms of leadership, God help us!  
 
Again to our ethics commission and Governor Bush.  And to those of you Commission members who do receive this email, better take notice.  Your arrogance is becoming too old to this citizen and many others who really do care for Greater Miami.

Greetings!

 

            My name is jeffrie vinson and I am the computer lab manager for Goodwill Industries here in Tallahassee. Here at Goodwill, we have a computer lab where, free of charge, people from the community can come to learn basic computer skills as well as some of the more popular software applications used by businesses in the area. Our goal is to help people better their job skills so that they might have a chance of finding employment or bettering their social standing by becoming productive members of society.

 

            Soon we will begin to offer a 4-month course that covers everything from how to dress for a job interview to computer skills and software applications. This, of course, brings me to the reason behind this letter…

 

            Currently we are in need of surplus computers. Fortunately, for us, the lab here in Tallahassee is in a better situation than most of the other Goodwill Industries computer labs in the state. Right now, most of our machines are under 5 years old and I would consider adequate for the type of work for which they are needed. Unfortunately, though, we still are in need of at least five more machines that are capable of running Windows XP so that we can fully furnish our classrooms. I would like to stress that these machines are for students of the free computer courses that we offer and would NOT be resold or given away to staff!

 

            Any help would be appreciated and I will be glad to meet and talk with you more on this matter if you would like.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	Hispanic Heritage Essay Contest

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am not sure whether or not you will actually receive this but if this gets anywhere close to someone in a position of authority, I will be satisfied.  I am writing because, my daughter Chalisse Morse, a senior at Freedom High School in Tampa, worked very hard on an essay for consideration for the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship contest.  Since it is such a wonderful scholarship opportunity I personally stayed on top of her to make sure she completed the essay and submitted it on time.  

 

She originally submitted her essay via email the day before the deadline and the next day received an email back stating that the essay needed to either be in Word or Rich Text format.  We weren't sure why we got the email back considering that the essay was written in Word.  I also personally typed and electronically signed off on the parental waiver.  I did this in Word too.   When Chalisse told me about the email that she received back, I told her there must have been an error in transmission and to resubmit and to make sure she was very careful about attaching the documents.  This all happened late the night before the deadline but she still resubmitted before the deadline.

 

The next morning, I began to think about the essay and the email she got back about it being in the right format and I told her, just to be sure that the document is received and readable to cut and paste the essay and the consent form into the body of the email with an explanation about why she was sending it again.  She did this.  We didn't hear anything back.

 

On Friday of last week, something told me to call the Scholarship Coordinator, Nadia Helberger, to make sure that she had, in fact, received all 3 of the submissions.  Ms. Helberger told me she did receive all three but that the first two were not readable because they came through as a "zip" file and that they are not allowed to open "zip" files and that it would have to be submitted in either Word or Rich text.  I explained to her what happened, that the essay was written in Word and that I personally typed the parental consent form in a Word document and that was the format that the first two submissions were made.  I told her that neither of us attached a "zip" file and that my best guess is that by sending it via AOL, perhaps AOL, "zips" the file but we would have no way of knowing that since all we did was attach both Word documents to the email.  I told her that I don’t even have anything that zips files and that I have never zipped a file before. I also told her that I had Chalisse resubmit the essay and consent form into the body of the email because the next morning I found myself concerned that there may have been another transmission error.  I assured her that we were tried to do everything that we could to make sure that we met the deadline and the fact that she submitted the essay three times was proof that she was trying to get it submitted in the correct format and on time.  I also reiterated that we had no way of knowing that the file was getting “zipped” because she simply tried to attach Word documents.  Ms. Helberger notified me that since the final submission, which was readable, was received the following morning that she would not be able to consider the essay at all.  I asked if there is someone with whom I could speak that I could appeal the decision.  She told me no.  She was very polite and nice but  I really feel like this warrants additional consideration.

 

Mr. Bush, I understand about meeting the deadlines, and she DID try.  The fact that she submitted the essay and consent form, two times prior to the deadline and hours after the deadline shows that she was trying.  We would have never even known that the second submission was unacceptable if I hadn’t called.  I am not trying to get special consideration, just a fair shot for my daughter who worked very hard on this essay.  Whether or not she is the selected winner is less of an issue for me at this point than the fact that she can’t even be considered.    I think that there should be another person who weighs in on the final decision especially because it is a scholarship opportunity of such a great magnitude!

 

Having learned my lesson, I am also including her essay into the body of this email.  Please have someone on your team at least reconsider the decision not to allow her essay into consideration.  Thank you in advance for the opportunity to raise this issue.

The Importance of the Hispanic Culture in Florida

 

Why is learning about Florida’s diverse Hispanic heritage and culture important?  It’s important because the Hispanic story is our story, the American story.  Hispanic heritage and culture can be seen, felt, heard and experienced all across the country and especially in Florida. Without it, the United States and especially Florida wouldn’t resemble all that we have come to know and love.  

 

Without Hispanic heritage and influence, many things we take for granted might be very different.  From the places we live, to the food we eat, to the way we celebrate and have a good time!  Let’s imagine it... 

 

Imagine living in a state with a different name.  Florida may not have been called Florida, if Ponce De Leon hadn’t named the land for the Spanish term for Easter.  He did this since it was the first land he saw during the Easter season.  We would notice the difference in our city names too.  It’s hard to imagine cities like St. Augustine, Pensacola, Sanibel and the wonderful Ybor City with different names.  

 

Can you imagine not knowing about foods like tacos or empanadas?  How about not knowing about wonderful desserts like honey drenched sopaillas or creamy flan? 

 

Imagine not having a great time at a Cinco de Mayo celebration or not catching beads at the Gasparilla parade.  What would children’s parties be without the fun of a piñata just waiting to be burst open? 

 

What would reruns of “I Love Lucy” be like without the rumba sound of Ricky’s band?  From Tejano music made popular by Selena, to Caribbean soul sung by Gloria Estafan to the smooth pop sounds of Carlos Santana. We have all enjoyed music that is rich in Hispanic heritage and culture.  We have enjoyed listening to these sounds while doing dances like the Conga, the Tango, the Lambada and the Macarena.  

 

How about missing out on outstanding athletes like Tino Martinez or soccer legend Pele?  Pele’s influence can be felt all across Florida every weekend as soccer parents sit on the sidelines cheering on their future “Pele”s.  

 

Imagine not hearing our fusion of English and Spanish words in everyday conversations.  Imagine conversations without phrases like “hola, chica and chico, rapido, que pasa, un momento, comprende”.    

 

As if all of these things were not enough, imagine not learning the valuable lesson that the Hispanic heritage and culture teaches.  The lesson that despite the fact that people of Hispanics descent come in all colors, races, religions, and locations, they are all still embraced as one. What an incredible message about valuing each member for their unique contribution to a beautiful mosaic of heritage and culture based on unity and love.  

I don’t want to even try to imagine that!  

 

Like I said earlier, the Hispanic story is our story.  That’s why it’s so hard to imagine life without the wonderful influences of Hispanic culture and heritage.

Subject:	[*] notary public office complaint

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am writing to you since I seem unable to make telephone contact or have a call returned by your notary public office. To say that I am unhappy with this program office would be an understatement.

 

Last month I filed a complaint with the notary office, provided them with the necessary documentation, and even researched the statute referencing what had been done wrong and where it violated the statute. 

 

Your notary section has not done anything to the violator except issue a slap on the wrist in the form of a written reprimand for actions that the statute clearly states constitutes a third degree felony. The referenced section of the law is Section 117.105, Florida Statutes. 

 

Your office has chosen to issue a reprimand when the called for action on the part of your office by statute would be prosecution for the felony. In the letter of reprimand it clearly states that the notary in question, Alan Lindsay, The letter acknowledges the failure to legally take an acknowledgement of a written instrument as a notary public and further acknowledges that what he did was the false or fraudulent taking of an acknowledgement. Mr. Lindsay did not do this just once, but three times he falsified a document.

 

What Mr. Lindsay did falls under the purview of Section 117.105, Florida Statutes, and this section does not state the responsible party may or might be guilty of a felony, but clearly states that they are guilty of a third degree felony. The statute does not allow room for mistakes.

 

Even worse in his response to your office it is obvious that Mr. Lindsay’s entire written demeanor is flippant and cavalier. 

 

Governor Bush, I believe that there is something that truly stinks about this resolution as any of the many people I know who are notaries have told me that they would expect to loose their license and quite possibly be prosecuted for this type of action and failure. Yet, all Mr. Lindsay receives is a slap on the wrist reprimand? I do not believe it is within the purview of your office to pick and choose, which sections of law apply, but I do believe that it is your responsibility as governor to enforce the laws. Therefore, I am requesting that this matter be brought before the Palm Beach County State Attorney for prosecution of the violations of law as is required by the law.

Subject:	Trooper R. A. McSwiney

Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I am a Citizen of the Great State of Florida. I personally campaigned for and voted for President Reagan; for your Father, for "W" and you, Sir! I am a die-hard Republican and I would give my life for my Country now, tomorrow or whenever I am needed. I am a 100% Disable Combat Vietnam Veteran; also I am a Non-Denominational Minister with a Doctorate's in Divinity. Also, I have two PhDs; Counseling; Drug and Alcohol and am finishing up a 3rd in Psychiatry.
 
I would not normally make a complaint to my State Government, especially about a Law Enforcement Official, however, I feel this instance warrant's reporting. On 7/24/2006, I was driving east on Thomas Drive to a medical appointment at the Panama City VA Outpatient Center. At 9:27 A.M. I was stopped by State Trooper R.A. McSwiney, Badge 944, ID#2329, Troop Unit A. My citation number is 3751-SFX.
 
I pulled over and stopped; Trooper McSwiney came up, I let down my window and ask was there a problem? In a very belligerent voice, he responded "you bet your ass there is a problem....your were speeding"! I asked "Sir"? He blared out "you were doing 50 in a 35"! Again, I asked "Sir"? He replied, "you heard what I said"! He then asked for my driver's license, registration and proof of insurance.  I commenced to get the documents out and stated " I was not doing 50MPH, my cruise control was set at 40 MPH". He snapped back "that's a lie!" I said "no Sir I was doing 40; can't you give me a warning ticket for only 5MPH over the speed limit". The Trooper snapped back sarcastically "I don't give warning tickets"! I advised I will be late for my appointment at the VA Outpatient Clinic and he replied "well now that's your problem not mine"! I handed the Trooper my registration and proof of insurance, and advise "my driver's license is at home on my printer; I had to make a copy to send and forgot to put it back in my wallet". He took what I gave him and stated, "I'll be right back, you better not go no where"!
 
The Trooper came back to my car and stated, "you have two citations, one for speeding 50 in a 35; and one for driving without a license. You can take the license ticket and your license by the Clerk of Court and that will take care of that ticket". He then gave me a pamphlet and stated "send your fine in this envelope to take care of the speeding ticket"! I advised "I am going to Court Sir, because I was not doing 50 MPH". That appeared to anger the Trooper. He stated, "you just as well go ahead and pay your fine, it won't do you any good to go to court!. I stated, we I am, it's not right to be ticketed for something I was not doing" 
 
The Trooper then angrily demanded, "sign here on both the tickets"; pointing to the bottom line where his signature was at. I stated, "Sir I have never been required to sign for a ticket in my life; there is nothing requiring me to "sign for these tickets"! At that point, the Trooper backed a couple of steps away from my vehicle and placed his hand on his weapon and shouted, "I am requiring you to sign them; now you either sign the tickets or I am going to put your ass in jail!" I stated "If I did not have my VA Doctor's appointment, you could take me to jail, but under the circumstances, however illegal, I don't have any choice, do I"?. He yelled, "you can bet your ass, I'll lock you up if you don't"! I suggested to the Trooper that if hates his job that much, he might consider another line of work, because he certainly does not have any patience, communication skills, respect for and certainly does not work well with the public. At that point he grumbled something and returned to his vehicle and I continued on to my Doctor's appointment. I was 15 minutes late; however my Doctor was running behind and she was able to see me about the time I walked in the Clinic.
 
I respectfully request that Trooper McSwiney be reprimanded for his belligerent attitude and conduct. He is a public servant, not a vigilante and his badge should not give him the right to abuse me, intimidate me, hassle me, threaten me, curse at me and treat me as if I were a common criminal.
 
Respectfully,

Subject:	domestic violence

Governor Bush,
I am writing to you out of extreme need. My present wife is a person who reached out to me a little over a year ago to help her out of her domestic violent situation of 17 years. She reached out to me the night her ex husband raped her and threatened her with his guns stating as he patted his shotgun..."if you ever leave me I know how to hide the body so it will never be found"  He is ex law enforcement, terminated for reasons of sexual harassment, excessive use of force and going to motor cross races instead of showing up for duty, using his kids being sick as a cover story.
This case gets a lot deeper. 
The courts took his guns away with the protective order and then while still on probation for violating the protective order allowed him to have his guns back. He stalked her, befriending a former co-worker and finding out where we lived and more. He told his children during their "supervised" visits with them that he watches us through the woods. The children revealed to their therapist about his abuse on them, but we can not use that because he is protected by the BS parental alienation syndrome that the courts seem to favor. 
well it got to the point where the kids were afraid to go outside, did not want to see him any longer and my wife was afraid to go to work or the store or anywhere alone. 
Now her ex husband is using the court system in his favor, stating we are keeping the children from him. This man choked his 9 year old daughter for putting the toilet paper on the roll backwards. 
That is just the tip of what we have found out. What the children have revealed to the therapist and what they have "since we escaped to safety" told us.
During her first attempt at escape about 3 years ago, he told one of the children who would have been 8 at the time "if you do not remember every right and left to get to where you live I will squeeze your bones out of you"
In the first month of this escape he ended up following her to the safe house she was in trying to break down the door. He did get arrested for that but only went to jail for a night. 
This man is a classic sociopath, sweet and innocent in front of those who can win him favor and award him but when he gets behind closed doors his true colors come out. I can tell you when I first went to the place where they lived to help my wife gather some of her belongings, the house was like a cave. I went to open the blinds to let some sun in and the kids tried to stop me  "we are not allowed to open the blinds" they said. I told them that was the old days, we will let the world in.
Well now due complete fear on the part of my wife and the children we fled the state of Florida. We felt that we were not protected there, the courts gave this man his guns back, the police could not do anything because he was always gone by time they were called.
Now there is a court case, he is suing for custody because we left the state. Let me tell you just how much he was watching us. we fled the state on a Sunday morning at 8:15Am, he had his lawyers in court two days later filing an emergency custody petition.
Governor Bush, we need to be protected.  We need the courts to keep this man from winning this case and not forcing us to go back in harms way. Please help me keep my wife and her children safe. I will give you all of the information you need but feel that in this email it would be too much. 
A Florida DCF worker stated that she would love to be subpoenaed because she would never let him have the kids.
Help us,
Thank you,
Jack McGloughlin

STATE OF FLORIDA
 
DEAR SIR:
 
FIRST LET ME SALUTE YOU. I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING TO GET IN CONTACT WITH YOU FOR A WHILE. I LIVE IN VENEZUELA BUT I AM DEEPLY DISGUSTED WITH THE COMMENTS OF HUGO
CHAVEZ AT THE U.N. BECAUSE YOUR BROTHER ACCORDING TO AN INTERVIEW I HEARD ON NPR WHEN I WAS TRUCKING A WHILE BACK IN THE U.S. IS BOTH A CONFESSED CHRISTIAN WITH BILL GRAHAM AND A CONFESSED AND REPENTED ALCOHOLIC.
I DONT THINK THAT CHAVEZ EVER SAW YOUR BROTHER DRINK. HE IS DWELLING ON RUMOR THAT PUTS HIM CLOSER TO A LIAR THAN A GOOD JUDGE. THAT MEETING WAS NOT A TRIAL THAT I KNOW BUT A FORUM ON INTERNATIONAL POLICY. THAT WAS DEAD WRONG.
 
LET ME GET TO MY PROBLEM NOW. THE CREATION OF THE U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY DEPT BROUGHT A STORM IN MY LIFE LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA. I WAS PROBATED IN 1987 FOR A CHARGE OF ASSAULT IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. I COULD NOT FULFILL THE COMMITMENT BECAUSE I WAS UNEMPLOYED AND MY FAMILY HAD FALLEN APART DUE TO A BAD DIVORCE THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
MY NAME IS JESUS A. SARMIENTO ALIEN CARD A30-617-822. TO AVOID PROBLEMS I MOVED TO THE STATE OF TEXAS WHERE IN MORE HAN 17 YEARS OF RESIDENCE I HAD NO PROBLEMS  WITH THE LAW EXEPT FOR A SPEEDING TICKET THAT I REMIDIED WITH DEFENSIVE DRIVING SCHOOL.
MY ALIEN CARD WAS CANCELLED DUE TO THE FACT THAT FLORIDA THREATENED TO DEPORT ME AFTER I SERVED A JAILED SENTENCE FOR BEING A FUGITIVE ACCORDING TO MY LAST EMPLOYER FOR WHOM I WORKED THE LAST 4 YEARS WHO CONTACTED THE COURT.
I VISITED THE U.S. CONSULATE IN CARACAS BUT WITH THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE WAR ON TERROR IN PROGRESS AND A REBEL LEADER HERE EVERYTHING IS COLDER THAN ICE.
NO EAR OR SYMPATHY TO MY CASE. I APPLIED THERE FOR U.S.CITIZENSHIP BASED ON AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE FOR A VERY SHORT SERVICE IN THE U.S. NAVY BUT THE OFFICER HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME THAT MY DOCUMENT WAS ALTERED. THAT IS NOT TRUE.
I HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN CREDIT CARD DEBT THAT I WILL REPAY IF MY STATUS WERE TO BE REPAIRED AND BE ABLE TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY WITHOUT PERSECUTION THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOU. I NEED AND AMNESTY OR EXECUTIVE PARDON.
 
TO CLOSE I WILL SAY THAT NOBODY IS PERFECT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD. YET HE GIVES
US SHELTER ON REPENTANCE. I AM SORRY FOR BREAKING THE LAW OF YOUR STATE BUT,
WITH SUBMISSION I ASK YOU TO DO WHATEVER YOU CAN FOR ME.

Hell Sir,
 
My name is Courtland Santos, a resident from Jacksonville, FL. I'm in the process  of starting my own security company. The crime rates here in our city has slowly decreased over the past few years. I was just wondering if there is any way I can get help from any government agency to get funding for my business. I would like to provide our low income areas in Jacksonville with mobile patrols. I plan on hiring former law enforcement and military veterans to help reduce the crime in our city, by creating what I call a community response team (CRT).
 
I will be more than happy to give you more info about my future company upon request.
 
I'll appreciate any response from you.
 
Thank you,

Subject:	Illegal Aliens

  

Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my concerns about illegal aliens in Florida and for that matter America. Last year while working Hurricane claims in Miami, I was shocked to find that I was not in America at all. From the billboards, to the street signs, to the person checking me out at a grocery store everything was in Spanish. I thought that I lived in America. I truly felt like a minority.

I am the daughter of a deceased Colonel in the Air Force. He fought for our freedom, and taught me first hand what a privilege it was to be from a country like America. I have lived and visited many countries all over the world and know firsthand what a privilege to be American. Now I go to a city in America, and it’s as if I’m visiting another country. I don’t know of any other country where you make a phone call and they ask you to dial 1 to have the conversation in English. I don’t know of another country where Americans get free health care – even if I came into their country illegally.

I am concerned about the state of our country if we continue to allow the Aliens to mandate such changes. This is America, English is our language, and we Americans have to follow the laws that “we the people vote for” – they should as well. Send anyone that has not entered the country through legal means back to where they came from. Do not allow immunity for anyone who is here illegally. Send them home. Stop accommodating them – speak English only! 

Below was in an email that I received and I had to wonder how different it was here???? 

 

“Illegal Immigrants: Equal Medical Care Or Better Medical Care? -- by Bryanna Bevens , military wife 

"As I mentioned in a previous column, I am hugely fat pregnant right now 
(by the time this is published I may have had the little critter.hopefully) so I have baby issues on the brain. 

 

"Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas is a fairly famous institution and for a variety of reasons: 

 

1. John F. Kennedy died there in 1963 
2. Lee Harvey Oswald died there shortly after 
3. Jack Ruby-who killed Lee Harvey Oswald, died there a few years later..by coincidence 

 

"On the flip side, Parkland is also home to the second busiest maternity ward in the country with almost 16,000 new babies arriving each year. (That's almost 44 per day---every day) 

 

'"A recent patient survey indicated that 70 percent of the women who gave birth at Parkland in the first three months of 2006 were illegal immigrants.' Crikey, that's 11,200 anchor babies born every year .just in Dallas. According to the article, the hospital spent $70.7 million delivering 15,938 babies in 2004 but managed to end up with almost $8 million dollars in surplus funding. Medicaid kicked in $34.5 million, Dallas County taxpayers kicked in $31.3 million and the feds tossed in another $9.5 million. 

 

"'The average patient in Parkland's maternity wards is 25 years old, married and giving birth to her second child.' She is also an illegal immigrant. By law, pregnant women cannot be denied medical care based on their immigration status or ability to pay. OK, fine. That doesn't mean they should receive better care than everyday, middle-class American citizens. But at Parkland Hospital, they do. 

 

"Parkland Memorial Hospital has nine prenatal clinics. NINE. 

 

"The Dallas Morning News article followed a Hispanic woman who was a patient at one of the clinics and pregnant with her third child---her previous two were also born at Parkland. Her first two deliveries were free and the Mexican native was grateful because it would have cost $200 to have them in Mexico. This time, the hospital wants her to pay $10 per visit and $100 for the delivery but she was unsure if she could come up with the money. Not that it matters, the hospital won't turn her away. (I wonder why they even bother asking at this point.) 

 

"How long has this been going on? What are the long-term affects? 

 

"Well, another subject of the article was born at Parkland in 1986 shortly after her mother entered the U.S. illegally---now she is having her own child there as well. (That's right, she's technically a U.S. citizen.) These women receive free prenatal care including medication, nutrition, birthing classes and child care classes. They also get freebies such as car seats, bottles, diapers and formula. 

 

"Most of these things are available to American citizens as well but only for low-income applicants and even then, the red tape involved is almost insurmountable. 

 

"Because these women are illegal immigrants they do not have to provide any sort of legitimate identification---no proof of income. An American citizen would have to provide a social security number which would reveal their annual income---an illegal immigrant need only claim to be poor and the hospital must take them at their word. 

 

"My husband is a pilot for the United States Navy 
(yes, he fought in Iraq) and while the health care is good, we Navy wives don't get any of these perks! "Car seats? Diapers? Not so much. "So my question is this: Does our public medical care system treat illegal immigrants better than American citizens? Yes it does! 

 

"As I mentioned, the care I have received is perfectly adequate but it's bare bones, meat and potato medical care---not top of line. 

 

"Their (the illegals) medical care is free---simply because they are illegal immigrants? Once again, there is no way to verify their income. 

 

"Parkland Hospital offers indigent care to Dallas County residents who earn less than $40,000 per year. (They also have to prove that they did not refuse health coverage at their current job Yeah, the 'free' care is not so easy for Americans.) 

 

"There are about 140 patients who received roughly $4 million dollars for un-reimbursed medical care. As it turns out, they did not qualify for free treatment because they resided outside of Dallas County. So the hospital is going to sue them! Illegals get it all free! But U.S. citizens who live outside of Dallas County get sued! How stupid is this? 

 

"As if that isn't annoying enough, the illegal immigrant patients are actually complaining about hospital staff not speaking Spanish. In this AP story, the author speaks with a woman who is upset that she had to translate comments from the hospital staff into Spanish for her husband. The doctor was trying to explain the situation to the family and the mother was forced to translate for her husband who only spoke Spanish. This was apparently a great injustice to her. 

 

"In an attempt to create a Spanish-speaking staff, Parkland Hospital is now providing incentives in the form of extra pay for applicants who speak Spanish. Additionally, medical students at the University of Texas Southwestern for which Parkland Hospital is the training facility will now have a Spanish language requirement added to their already jammed-packed curriculum. No other school in the country boasts such a ridiculous multi-semester (multicultural) requirement. 

 

"In the meantime, I have to end my column here. I have to go buy a car seat." 

 

(Ed: Sorry for the length, but this needs wide circulation----particularly to our "employees" in the Congress.)

Dear Governor, 

            

            I am please to say that I enjoyed your terms in office and hope that you as a great politician will continue to grow and succeed in your career. I am fond of, the community outreach and help you have provide for the community to succeed and grow.  Your funding in to the public schools is a great success and is greatly appreciated. Especially, since I have four kids that are and have been in the Florida Public School system. I am grateful to have you as are governor for the last 8 years, because I have been living in Florida since 1985 and I have seen tremendous changes to the state environment, economic status and political aspect. I must tell you that it was during your term that a lot of those changes occurred. 

 

            However today I come to you to ask that you recognized my name Mrs. Maryse Lubin a mother of four, a wife and a citizen of the United States of American. Sixteen years ago I received my LPN (Licesne Pratical Nurse) at Miami Lakes Technical School at that time I was a single mother who wanted to better my self, which I did. 

 

About 4 years ago I graduated from Broward Community College with an Associated Degree in Nursing to Practice as a Registered Nurse. However due to my misfortune and regretful situation, I was put in the Federal System for committing fraudulent activities, which I sincerely apologize for the situation. I paid for the consequences for my actions; I also completed all the required community work that was requested. After completing everything including paying off the fine, I took a long look at my self and have sworn never to put my self in that situation ever again.  

 

However, after all this ordeal I am now BEGGING for YOUR PARDON so that I may have my CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORED in order for me to take the Florida Nursing State Boards Exam.  I know you are a great Governor and a great Family Man, I am hoping that you take my letter into immense consideration. 

 

 

Thank You,

Stephens Crushed Stone
9901 Foxboro Rd.
Fort Smith, AR. 72903
 
September 25, 2006
 
 
 
Governor Bush:
 
It has been over a year since I contacted your Haitian recovery office. At that time I did not realize that the temporary government would not or could not commit to long term agreement. This year we have been working with the elected government and they have embraced our long term recovery plan for an aggregate, crushing plant on the West coast of Haiti including a port, a block plan and construction company to bid on road projects. We have also given them a plan to revive the Autoboite Valley for growing of grain to feed the people and start a livestock industry in the same area.
 
The problem is the investment money for Haiti has dried up. The only investment money that we have found in the last year is one that wants 30% money up front and control of the company. I had a conversation with one of the largest mining companies in the South east last week and was told not one dime for Haiti but they will buy our material if we could put the project together. I had not presented our plan offshore until last week. I got a response today that there was no money to be had for Haiti.
 
Over a five year time there will be forty to fifty-million dollars invested in Haiti. After the first two years the project will support most of this investment.
 
Governor, I know at one time you where very interested in Haitian recovery. We have now spent over two years and have run out of options. We need 1.5 Million dollars to start the project and to carry it for two years. The Haitian government is waiting on us to notified them that we are ready to start. If you have any suggestions they would be appreciated.
 
Sincerely,

Good afternoon Mr. Governer Jeb Bush,
  My name is Angel M. Holzapfel and I have applied for my rights back as a us citizen and I have gotten no where. I have applied for them twice once in 12-05-2005 under my married name. Called about it and was told that I have to do one under the name I got convicted, so I did. that one was back in 1-16-2006. Why does it take so long.     I just called today and was told that they are just now doing the ones in January and February of 2005. This is rediculous!!!!!! I was told by the gentleman that I spoke to, that a letter was mailed out to me when I got out, for a hearing to be done, I never recieved that letter or else I would have been there. So because I did not show and was not told about it they denied my rights to be restored. I THINK THAT IS WRONG!!!! I am very upset that it is taken so long to get my rights restored. By the time i do get them restored it will be time for me to do my rights for gun rights, and then that will take 5 to 10 years for that to be approved. This is one thing we pay taxes for, I think there needs to be a diffrent plan on this subject and I am sure alot of people would back me up on this!!!!!!  I have been out since oct. 10, 2000. it is now 09-25-2006. I would like to have my rights restored so at least I can vote. I do know there was a patition done not to long ago about voting, and alot of people could not vote cause they are convicted felons. PLEASE HELP. I really would like to get my rights back. I understand that it takes a while, BUT NOT THIS LONG!!!!!                Thank you

Subject:	[*] clemency

Dear Sirs,
          I don't know if you can help or not. I work for PARR inspections contractor for FEMA and now because of the 9/11 attacks they are running new background checks. I had served time in 1981-1982. I applied for clemency in 1994 and was told that I had to liens against me so I could not get clemency until the liens where released. The liens are released and I sent in a certified copy of the releases and all charging documents. I was told that because there was no violence in my crimes and had not been in any trouble since i got out in 1982. I woulkd only need to have a review and not a hearing. I was told that it will not be reviewed for about 8 months and the only way to have it reviewed any sooner was for the governer okay it. If they run the new background check before I get clemency then I loose my job and can never work for them again. I really like my job. I get to help a lot of people. I worked in Florida for Charlie,Frances,Ivan ,Jean and then P.R. two years ago and last year I worked Dennis,Katrina,Ruth and Wilma. This year I was the first one to try the new system for Alberto. I take my job very seriously. I have very good Quality Control scores on my inspections. I would hate to loose my job because of my stupidity 24 years ago. I thaught when I served my time that would be the end of it, But I have continued to pay for it until now. My 2 sons always want to know why I can't go hunting with them. I really don't want them to find out about my past. I have tried very hard to teach them not to do what I did. If I loose my job I will have to tell them why, Because My oldest son also works for PARR inspections. If there is anything you can do I would be forever greatful.
Thank You for your time

Dear Governor Bush:

    As a Yankeetown resident, I would like to thank you and your staff from the bottom of my heart for “saving Yankeetown.”  Your gifts of the Emergency Order  and special council election demonstrate immutably your commitment to the principle of democracy.

    I trust that, since you and the Financial Emergency Board went to all that trouble, you will ignore the disgraced mayor of Yankeetown’s final attempt in her resignation letter asking you to hand over our town to outsiders.  The record turnout of the election I believe demonstrates clearly the importance of keeping our community as an entity.  I personally commit to doing all I can to help show the state of Florida that your judgment was perfect.

    So once again, I thank you very, very much and ask that Yankeetown remains a viable and legal town.  We’ll make you proud!

Sincerely,

Edward Candela

Subject:	DOROTHY VACCARO APPOINTMENT

Dear Governor Bush,
 
    Please take the time to read this letter on behalf of Dorothy Vaccaro, a judicial nominee for appointment in the Sixth Judicial Circuit.  I have known Ms. Vaccaro for the past seven years and I strongly believe that she would make an excellent Circuit Court Judge.  I am certain that you have received many letters already on her behalf.  I write this letter from a very different perspective than some.  I have worked as an Assistant State Attorney under her supervisor role as a lead trial attorney, until she was appointed by you to the County Court Judge position in Pinellas County. 
     I believe that a person isn't measured by the position you hold, but rather by the respect that you have earned.  Ms. Vaccaro has gained the respect of numerous members of the bar, families and victims she has represented and now for the citizens she represents on the bench.  
    Ms. Vaccaro has the integrity and drive to continue to the highest level of the judiciary. She believes in the judicial system and has the ability to represent the judiciary in the most positive light.  If you would choose her as your appointment, she would further your ability to make excellent judicial appointments.  Ms. Vaccaro has been able to lead by example and has been on the panel that has been created by the Supreme Court to give fellow judges and judicial candidates the ethics opinions on some of the most complex situations that arise. 
    In conclusion, I consider Ms. Vaccaro as my own personal role model.  I admire her intellect, drive and most of all integrity.  She is currently an excellent County Court Judge, but she would be better suited for the Circuit level position due to her vast experience in the Circuit Court System. I truly believe in her as a person and as a judge. If you have any questions about her please feel free to contact me.
 
                                                                                                                                        Sincerely,

Subject:	Produção de  Álcool no Brasil / Alcohol's Production in Brazil
Attachments:	"AVG certification"

Prezado Sr. Bush
 
 
Eu sou engenheiro mecânico, trabalhei como pesquisador no projeto do desenvolvimento do motor à álcool , aqui no Brasil nos anos 1970's e começo do 1980's, dentro do Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas do Estado de São Paulo - IPT .
 
Há certos dados que gostaria de levar para aqueles que querem produzir combustíveis a partir da biomassa, como é o caso dos Estados Unidos
 
1.- Hoje com a tecnologia que a SASOL da África do Sul desenvolveu nos últimos 50 anos (e que atualmente se associou à CHEVRON dos Estados Unidos ), é mais produtivo  produzir álcool metílico a partir da madeira ( se produz oito vezes mais álcool a partir da madeira do que a partir da cana de açúcar, considerando a mesma massa de madeira e de cana);
 
2.- Com essa mesma tecnologia da SASOL, se produz 120 litros de álcool METÍLICO por tonelada métrica de bagaço de cana, enquanto se produz usualmente menos de 100 litros  de álcool ETÍLICO  por tonelada de cana. Esse aumento de produtividade se dá devido ao processo FISCHER-TROPSCH, de produção de combustíveis a partir de biomassa, ao invés do processo tradicional de fermentação e destilação que é o processo atualmente utilizado no Brasil;
 
3.- Considerando que graças às condições geo-climáticas do Brasil a taxa de crescimento florestal é de 50 (cinquenta) toneladas de madeira, por hectare , por ano, a produção de álcool de madeira é 4 (quatro) vezes maior em relação a produção do álcool de cana (utilizando o processo FISCHER-TROPSCH);
 
4.- O Processo FISCHER-TROPSH permite também a produção de combustíveis (gás de cozinha, gás industrial, gasolina, óleo diesel e querosene) e lubrificantes sintéticos (óleos e graxas), todos eles a partir da madeira. Segundo estudos teóricos , para cada tonelada métrica de madeira se produz : 18 % de óleo diesel; 42 % de gasolina; 10 % de óleo lubrificante; 15 % de querosene; 15 % de gases industriais e graxas.
 
Se os investidores dos Estados Unidos pretenderem investir aqui no Brasil na produção de combustíveis a partir da biomassa, sugiro que façam um estudo juntamente com a SASOL / CHEVRON, visando otimizar a produção de combustíveis por unidade de área plantada.
 
Atenciosamente
 
Eng.º José Geraldo R. de A. Filho 
 
 
 
 
 
Dear Mr. Bush
 
 
 
I'm mechanical engineer, 55 years old, and I was a former  researcher  of the project to development of alcohol's fueled engines,here in Brazil, in the 1970's  and begining of 1980's , in the "Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas do Estado de São Paulo - IPT".
 
There are some data I wish that people who wants produce fuels from biomass, just as the case of USA .
 
1.- Nowadays with South African SASOL's technology developed at last 50 years ( see SASOL / CHEVRON partnership in USA), is more profitable to make METHYL ALCOHOL from wood ( eight more times alcohol than sugar cane, for the same original mass);
 
2.- With the same SASOL's technology it produces 120 liters of METHYL ALCOHOL, for one metric ton of sugar cane bagass, while usually we can produce circa of 100 liters of ETHYL ALCOHOL. This alcohol's amount increase is obtained by FISCHER-TROPSCH process , that is diferent of the traditional process of fermentation and destilation of sugar cane molasses;
 
3.- With Brazilian geo-climatics conditions, the growing forestry rate per year , per hectare, is 50 metric tons. On this way the METHYL ALCOHOL's production (by FISCHER-TROPSCH) is 4 ( four) times larger than ETHYL ALCOHOL obtained by traditional process from sugar cane , considering the same area;
 
4.-  Also from FISCHER-TROPSCH process it obtains fuels and lubricants like gasoline, kerosene, diesel oil, waxes, greases, etc,  all them from woods. Theorycally from 1 (one) metric ton of wood we can have : 18 % diesel oil ; 42 % gasoline; 15 % kerosene; 15 % gases and greases.
 
If american investors pretend put their money here in Brazil to produce fuels from biomass origins, I suggest you to make a study with SASOL/CHEVRON, seeing to optmize fuel 's production  by area unity.

Hi!  Next week, could you please mention that October 1-7 is Mental Illness Awareness Week in the newsletter?  Severe mental illnesses are biological brain disorders, and are not the fault of either the individual or the family.  They affect nearly one million Floridians, most of whom suffer from lack of good treatment, discrimination, and fear over what is happening to them.  They live lives of shattered dreams, poverty, and often homelessness, yet many who receive the health care and support they need are great members of their communities, and often the best volunteers for community projects.  Mentioning the week will continue our efforts to bring more public awareness to these illnesses.  Thanks in advance, Sue

Dear Governor Bush,
 
We would you to invite you to join us in a great day for St. Petersburg - the Ground Breaking Ceremony for Signature Place Condominum on Thursday, October 5th, 2006 at 5:30 p.m.
 
The “Signature Place” development in downtown St. Petersburg will be the tallest building in Pinellas County at 35 floors and is the largest private construction project in Tampa Bay’s history at $150 million dollars.  It is being designed by a world famous architect, Ralph Johnson.  The project was featured in the Wall Street Journal and in 244 newspapers around the U.S. and even in the China Post for its stunning design.  The project marks the renaissance of St. Petersburg, we have asked Mr. Crist’s to join us also since Signature is in his home turf.  Mr. Crist is familiar with the Signature Place project as it is located next to his residence at Bayfront Tower.  Mayor Rick Baker and several local and county elected officials will be attending as will several media outlets. 
 
Here is the link to the project web site at www.SignatureStPete.com.  It would be a great honor to have you join our event and celebrate with St. Petersburg in the start of a new landmark.  
 
Please call me should you have any questions at (727) 821-7300.

Governor Bush,
 
I want to thank you for signing the death warrants on your desk, instead of waiting on our lovely supreme court to do something.  I am speaking specifically about allowing Danny Rolling to die on October 25 for the murders of five innocent young people.  For some folks, the only deterrant for evil actions is the death penalty, and even then, some don't care about human life.  Every day I look at the news and I am sickened at the horrible things that people do to others, especially children.  I can't understand it?  All I can do is trust that God is still in control, and I do.  However, I try to vote for people that I believe will do the right thing, like you and your brother, the President.  I appreciate you and him and I know your jobs must be horrible some days.  I could not do either one.  I pray for each of you and your families and that God will bless you, protect your families and help both of you to make the right decisions.  My family voted for the entire Bush family for each election that we could.  We live in Florida, born and raised here.  We are conservative, country-loving, God-fearing people, and proud of it.  If you every decide to run for president of this nation, we will vote for you again.  For now, I just wanted to say thank you for trying hard to uphold justice.  I know you must hear a lot of critisizm in your job, but just know this, there are plenty of people that trust you and approve of your actions.
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
I read the story on our website about you visiting Sadler Elementary and I think that it is great that they got the opportunity to meet you. I just wanted to let you know that I am part of a school, West Oaks Elementary, in Orlando Florida. We are located in the West Learning Community of Pine Hills. We have been recognized by you and Commissioner Winn as one of the top 100 schools to make gains in writing (I teach 4th grade so thank you) and one of the top 100 schools overall for point improvement. We were in the 10 % of schools served by the Title One Program in Orange County, which met the very rigorous federal AYP standard under No Child Left Behind. We were the 2nd most improved in Orange County in terms of point gains traveling from the letter grade of a C to 16 point from a B. Why tell you all this? I tell you because in the event you swing through our neck of the words, I would like to extend a formal invitation for you to come and meet a school who has been working hard and has left no child behind and to meet my wonderful 4th grade children who, with the help of the whole school community, will help us claim our “B.”
 
Sincerely, 
 
Elizabeth A. Hooven

Dear Gov. Bush, 
I am sorry to bother you again, I know that with all that is going on in this state as well as world wide my troubles my be very small and important. I am writing to you again in hopes to be able to get an answer as to my clemency. 
In November 2003, I wrote you and your office and your sectary informed me to apply for a clemency hearing. I still have not heard any answer to when a hearing will be held. Now I am 35 years old and my 3 children are entering into their teen years. I have went to all the branches of the military to try make a better life for myself and my kids. I have been told that now the rules have been changed and I could get in if I could get the clemency up till I am 40 years of age. 
All I am asking is for at least a hearing before you and the board to plea my case and to have the chance to fight for my country as my father did in Viet Nam and to continue to serve my community in the best ways I know how. My father has even tried to get me into county jobs (corrections officer, animal services, park ranger etc...) and I have been turned away for the very same reasons as every where else. My 12 year old record. 
Sir, I understand that I was at fault for my actions but I am still an American and can't stand by and watch from the side as my countrymen and women are fighting for freedom. 
Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely, 
David A. Rios

Dear Governor Bush,

 

My son, Victor Manuel Silverman, is one of the many applicants for the Broward School Board District 1 interim appointment, and he is one of the few who actually live in District 1 and have children in District 1 schools. I have taken the liberty of writing to you to tell you a little bit about Victor.

 

I adopted Victor from Santiago, Dominican Republic in 1984 when he was 8 years old, and he is one of 3 children I adopted internationally. I also have volunteered for 25 years and serve as Adoption Program Director for Universal Aid For Children, an international non-profit adoption agency in Broward from which I adopted my children. Victor resided in a one room shack with a dirt floor and no plumbing or refrigeration in the Dominican Republic. He attended a school there that had no electric. Upon his arrival here, he entered what, back then, was called English as a Second Language (ESOL) in Broward Schools. At that young age he experienced a change of cultures, separation from family members, and language issues.

 

As the years passed, he progressed rapidly, became a naturalized citizen, and maintained pride in his heritage as well as his new country. Shortly after reaching adulthood, he entered the US Army and served for 6 years in the 82nd Airborne, and two of his three children were born at Fort Bragg. Then he returned to Florida and worked in the Security field. 

 

Because Victor’s oldest daughter, Isabel, age 9, has a language disorder and learning disability, he has seen the frustrations parents go through in trying to get ESE services for their child in a timely and competent manner. Consequently, I suggested that he start getting involved in parent advocacy.  

 

Victor, as a man of 30 years old now, is an excellent and hard working father. I am very proud of my son and my grandchildren. Victor is a true representation of the people who live in District 1. His is Latino and bilingual (he was also a certified Army linguist in Spanish). He was also raised by a Jewish family. Both backgrounds truly reflect the diversity of District 1. Although he is a Republican, he is the type of person that people in both parties can accept. He is non-political, will not run for the office, people now respect young men who have served their country in uniform, he lives in the District, and he has children in the District’s schools. 

 

Victor also has a good support system around him. I understand you have been sent emails from a leading Latino Republican leader in Broward and a well-respected education advocate and President of a state-wide education reform group who supported school choice and FCAT. I am a licensed School Psychologist, former guidance counselor, and former member of the Broward Schools District Advisory Committee, and other committees as well. I know several board members quite well. One of the current School Board members was friends with my kids growing up and we traveled with her family and the kids would spend nights and time at each other’s homes. The non-elected support people around him, including a member of the Audit committee, will be able to review the meeting packets with him, and make sure that he gets a quick orientation so that he can adequately represent his community, even if it is just for a matter of weeks.

 

Although ethnicity should not part of the criteria for selecting a Board member, the community knows that there has not been a Latino on the Broward School Board in many years, and there is no Latino running for School Board in any Broward district this year. So whether it is Victor or one of the other Latino applicants, it would be a nice gesture, particularly for the pride of the Latino students in Broward’s schools.

 

Thank you.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:

Please spare the life of Danny Rolling despite the seriousness of the accused 
crime.  Cancelling the execution and commuting the sentence to 
imprisonment would show humane consideration and civilized governance.  
New evidence and questions about proceedings may appear long after judicial 
decisions have occurred.

There are possibilities of mistaken identities, coerced confessions, inaccurate 
accusations, and wrongful dispute and judicial proceedings.  State killing works 
against dignified authority of state governance.  There are many arguments that 
state killing violates the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual 
punishment.  More than one hundred nations have abolished the death penalty.

Dear Governor Bush,

Please consider Victor Manuel Silverman for the vacant District 1 Broward School Board seat. This is a young Dominican-born man who overcame the odds of poverty, was adopted by a Broward family when he was 8 years old, attended Broward schools, served our country in the US Army 82nd Airborne, and whose children attend District 1 schools. Appointing Victor would be one way we can show appreciation for his service to our country. Victor having his own children in the District 1 schools makes him truly representative of this diverse community. His family’s friendship with School Board members and education activists in the community will ensure that he will have the support to represent his community. 

Thank you.

class would organize a handful of questions, e-mail them to you, and when
the Governor comes he could address those questions first in his speech,
and  then take any further questions he would have time for? We would hope
that he could appear in roughly 10 weeks from now, if not a little
sooner... any chance of this happening?  Thanks again for your time.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I would like to encourage your appointment of Victor Silverman to the vacant District 1 School Board seat in Broward County. I believe it is important to appoint someone who lives within the district, is politically neutral, and promises not to use their temporary position as a catapult for a November election.
 
I know his father who has a successful educational tutoring business as well.  As a parent of school age children and a product of the Broward school system, he will have some insight that the current Board members do not have. His experience in the military and working within a large team can only add, if only for awhile, to the pool of knowledge that guides the system.
 
As a former member of the Broward Superintendent's Advisory Committee on Gifted Student Programs, I am familiar with your Administration's good works, and trust that you will consider this carefully.

Subject: appropriate steps for proper relief or pardon

 

Governor Jeb Bush,

 

I have recently been denied employment by the Department of Justice Bureau of Prisons.  The reason for denial of employment was because of a 3rd degree felony arrest for burglary of an unoccupied structure on my record while I was in High School in 1991.  At that time, I had never been in trouble before and qualified for a state diversionary program known as Pre-Trial Intervention.  The case never went to court, I was never prosecuted and one charge was dropped and the other administratively dismissed after completing the program.  Since that time I have never been in trouble and I went on to join the United States Marine Corps from 1994-1998 in which I held a secret security clearance.  I was honorably discharged in 1998 after completing my four year enlistment.  I have been married now for 8 years and am attending FMU, pursuing a degree in Criminal Justice; building on my military experience.  I have come across certain situations in which I have been denied employment because of the aforementioned arrest record particularly in the criminal justice field, even though it never went to trial.  I have heard that I may be considered for employment only after being granted the proper relief or pardon for the incident in question which occurred fifteen years ago.  My question to you Governor Jeb Bush, is there a system in place, do I qualify, and how do I go about taking the appropriate steps?  I believe I would be a great asset in the field of criminal justice and that my arrest record does not represent who I am today.

Dear Gov. Bush,

I just wanted to say thank you for all that you have done for our state
during your years as Governor.  I know many times the job you do is
thankless and requires long hours, but I hope you have seen how many of your
initiatives have been put into action and are doing great things for our
citizens.

As a native Floridian, I am biased in believing that our state is one of the
greatest in the Union.  My husband (who is under your command as a National
Guard officer and pilot) and I have lived in several other states and can
honestly say that we chose to remain in Florida for it's educational
opportunities for our children as well as the job opportunities for my
husband.  He is an active duty pilot with the RAID program out of
Jacksonville and I am a stay at home mom raising our four children.  During
your time as Governor, you have worked on those issues which were of
greatest importance to our family; education, safety of children, support of
our military, and state support during hurricanes.  Our state is a model in
hurricane preparedness and I am very grateful and proud by how
well-organized our local, state, and federal programs are.  Your leadership
during difficult times was truly comforting.  Our children's elementary
school is 17th in the state and is a Blue Ribbon school, which you awarded.
While my husband was away on an overseas deployment, you came to support the
National Guard and their families at an event at the Jacksonville Landing.
For all these things and many more, again, I thank you.

I was a Political Science major and graduated from University of Florida and
worked with Connie Mack on his Senatorial campaign and on staff in
Washington, DC.  I was able to meet your father during his campaign for
President.  I have followed the careers of many people and have an
understanding of the difficulties involved with being in office.  I just
wanted to tell you that I hope you continue to serve our state and country
as admirably as you have already done.  It is obvious that you have been
raised in the tradition of serving and that is how we are trying to raise
our children.  My husband, who is a World War II history buff, is a fan of
your father and marvels at his exploits during the war, of which your father
downplayed most of the time.  I believe that speaks to your father's
character and his serving nature which he obviously passed on to you and the
rest of your family.

Thank you for your time and all that you have done.

Dear Governor Bush.
 
I know that your elected time in office is coming to a close.  Each year I pray for this, and each year goes by unanswered.  
 
On January 09,  1981 my husband took the day off because it was his birthday.  A Polk County Deputy by the name of Theron Burnham covered his shift.  That night Paul Johnson not only brutally killed Deputy Burnham in cold blood but several others.  All appeals to this point have been denied.  
 
On January 09, 2001 I watched my husband place a cross in the exact spot TA Burnham was killed feeling guilty that it was not him.  Each year that passes, he looks for the day Mr. Johnson will face his crime.  
 
My question to you is after almost 30 years...and several denials of appeals...why does this person continue to live off the tax payers he so choose to kill without remorse?
 
Our family supported your first election and re-election in hopes that the right thing would be done.  Meaning the offenders on death row would be sent before God for their final assignment. 
 
My husband will always have guilt, and the families in which he robbed, will always feel a loss for this mans one night of arrogance.  
 
My husband would also like to be present to see Paul Johnson meet his maker so he can move on with his life.  I tend to think almost 30 years is enough of a burden to bare for any individual.
 
I am sure this email will be filtered though many individuals.  Some will think it is important...others will not.  
 
What is boils down to is doing the right thing.  Here is in hopes you take this under consideration with the utmost respect in which it was sent.
 
Wishing you a long and happy life.
 
God Bless and take care.

Governor Bush
 
 After Clarence Hill was executed Wednesday evening, I guess it is fair to say that executions here in Florida are no longer on hold. I checked the Florida Supreme Court page with pending death warrants and it shows that Arthur Rutherford and Danny Rolling both have execution dates set for next month. As a supporter of the death penalty, I'm glad to see this. Both these men deserve to die for their crimes, and they shouldn't be crying for sympathy from you to spare them from execution. There are others who have been on death row longer though who have lost appeals in the 11th circuit court of appeals. Charles Foster is one example. The guy has been on death row since the 70's, and it appears that the 11th circuit denied him a COA. His case seems pretty confusing, but I don't understand why you don't sign death warrants on a more consistent basis to expedite the appeals process.
 
 Any death warrant that is signed after the 11th circuit denies relief should be considered very serious. All the appeals are expedited too. Why not carry more executions out at a quicker pace by signing death warrants opposed to waiting for years just for a meritless appeal to be resolved.

Governor Jeb Bush:
 
 I'm extremely pleased to see that death warrants have resumed here in the state of Florida. Media reports indicate that you signed a death warrant for Danny Rolling today, and renewed Arthur Rutherford's death warrant by scheduling his execution a week before Mr.Rolling.
 
 If this is a sign of things to come, I would strongly recommend that you not wait to sign other death warrants for those on death row who have exhausted their legal remedies. Before you leave office in January, it would be nice to see alot of these men who have lost appeals in the 11th circuit to have their executions carried out. A couple death row inmates I can refer you to include Paul Scott, Norman Parker, Ian Lightbourne, John Marek, and convicted child killer Mark Schwab.
 
 Alot of these men's crimes are pretty sickening. For one, I am glad that Danny Rolling will be facing execution next month. He was a serial killer. I would like to point out though that Norman Parker is a 3 time killer who was already serving a Life prison sentence for killing a policeman in 1967 before escaping custody and murdering another man. Mark Schwab is a convicted child killer and sex offender who also poses a grave risk to society. Both these men should have death warrants signed at the earliest convenience.
 
 I wouldn't wait until those 2 executions are carried out before signing more death warrants. The bottom line is that there are those out there who have in fact lost there legal appeals and now are just living off the state just waiting for an execution date to be set, while just filing meritless appeals

Good evening Gov. Jeb Bush,
 
I work for Ms. Julia R. Story of whom opened a Security Guard Service in Northwest Florida. The business opened the doors on 8-7-2006. Prior to this date we had to obtain all the licenses needed to conduct business. This started on 7-2-2006 and took most all the money that Ms. Story had. We had to obtain an office, equipment for the office, power for the office, phones, and so on. Then we were told that we had to become a Corp. in the State of Florida so we paid for this to be done. Then we had to apply for our Agency Lic. in order to be a Security Co. After we were approved and recieved our Agency Lic., we were then allowed to submit bids for work of which it was to late to get the contracts.
 
All the time and money we spent to open a business in Pensacola, Fl., with a women owner, we are now being forced to close our doors because no one wants her to make it in the business world and are waiting for her to fail. We have spent over $20,000.00 just getting to where we are now and for what???
 
The Co. has now ran out of money and has laid off the emplyees we had. We have contract proposals that have been submitted for possible hire and now no why to make the contracts good due to no money to operate. Everyone we have went to for Financial help has advised, Sorry---there is nothing we can do and we cannot grant you a loan. We have applied for Grants, and all those people want to charge us a fee to apply for the Grants. We have went to the SBA, SBDC, Banks, Financial Loan Co., and everyone has turned us down.
 
Other Security Companies in the area, have made sure, that by going around and bad mouthing us, we will not get any contracts around this area because they do not want us here taking away from their business. They come in and cut the bids below what we offer to keep the price down and the pay rates as low as possible. By doing this they get anyone from making a higher wage.
 
When our business was opened, no one from any of the Governmental offices at any level, came by to welcome us or shake our hand for being here. Everyone said that Florida was the place to come and do business and we wanted to provide our services to our community here in Pensacola.
 
We followed all the rules, all the state laws and got slapped in the face. Everyone of us here are now worried about keeping our homes and trying to figure out why we got treated the way we did. We have the bills to pay and no money to pay for nothing.
 
We started this business to help supply jobs to the area. Get people off the unemployment line and back to work. The Sheriff's Department has Deputies that charge more money than we do to provide Security during their off duty hours and keeps the little guys like us from getting any of the Security jobs here. What do we do???
 
Will you call us and see if you can help us keep our doors open??? We are owed and operated by a female and she is certified in the State of Florida.  We have done everything we know and we have no choice but t now come to you and ask for help.
 
Thank you sir for reading this information and we wait for your response.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I just received my Teacher Lead Money in my paycheck today and just wanted to say thank you. It was nice to see that it was increased to $250. It will spur me on to buy more things to motivate readers in our library media center at Naples High School. It really is money well spent as I will spend it in Florida!
 
On a side note, we have invited you several times in the past to come visit the Naples High School Library Media Center, especially in connection with your visit to Naples to promote reading. Each time we were either too late, or there was a conflict. I am issuing an invitation to you way in advance to visit our school and our library, why?
 
1. We have one of only a handful of high school Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) programs in the nation. We distribute free books and dictionaries to students in intensive reading and English as a Second Language programs, based on the generosity of local groups and foundations, three times a year.
 
2. We have an after school book club that reads and analyzes books and is so large that we aren't able to recruit new members. 
 
3. We have been recognized nationally by School Library Journal as being leaders in the nation in library services. One member of our staff has been asked to attend a "summit" of school library professionals in Chicago this November.
 
4. Our new principal has instituted a "Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)" program every Friday.
 
5. We take 40 of our Advanced Placement Laureate Program students on an annual field trip to Florida Gulf Coast University where the library staff there guides our students to books to support our student's research.
 
6. Our virtual library website has been recognized, again by School Library Journal, as one of the best in the nation:
 
http://collier.k12.fl.us/nhs/lmc
 
We know that reading to elementary school students is a great photo opportunity, but it would be an unusual and welcomed opportunity for you to promote reading by teens. I hope you are amenable to our request.
 
You our cordially invited to visit Naples High School and, if possible, to address our students on the importance of reading, on your next visit to Naples.
 
A sincere thank you.

Governor Bush,
 
My name is Cary Davis and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of the Florida Law Review. I had been working last semester with your General Counsel's office, trying to coordinate a visit by you to the College of Law here at UF this Fall. The idea was for you to speak about important Florida legal issues you have dealt with during your two terms.  I haven't heard anything further about your plans, and I thought I'd make one last request — this time directly to you. If this is something you are still interested in doing, please let me know and we'll make it happen. Mid-November would probably be the best time, but we will certainly work around your schedule (mindful that we probably shouldn't schedule anything late in the week of Florida-Georgia, or anytime during election week in early November).  I really think a speech by you, here at the state's flagship law school, about your experience with important legal issues facing Floridians, would make for a unique public education event, something that would benefit not only the law school and university community, but all Floridians.  
 
I look forward to your response. I know Rocky Rodriquez in the General Counsel's Office has been kept abreast of the discussions about your possible visit.
 
Warmest regards,
Cary

I hope this email reaches you, I would like to introduce myself to you, my name is Glenn Phillips I am a vice president for a company called certified slings located in Casselberry. I have been here for 23 years now. we have 6 locations in Florida, Miami, Ft Myers, Tampa, Orlando, Casselberry and Ocala. We manufacture wire rope slings, synthetic slings and tiedowns for the construction industry and trucking industry. We are also a supplier and vendor for the United States military, we supply and support them with helicopter slings, off shore replenishment wire ropes and we manufacture catapult wire rope assemblies that help the aircraft take off from aircraft carriers and the wire ropes that stop them when they land back onto the carrier. Some of our other larger customers are Disney, Kennedy Space Center, and the Dept. of Energy.
Certified Slings is now going thru its 3rd generation of ownership and management. The owner of the company and CEO is Ron Worswick and he is and has been and still is very active in the company and truly is the reason where we are at today and doing 30 mill a year in sales with approx. 130 team members.
 
Certified Slings was  awarded the 2003 Florida family business of the year award which the owner Ron Worswick was very proud of.
Ron Worswick is 78 years young and lives in Winter Park Florida, he has recently just this year gone thru some very rough times, he has had and survived pancreatic cancer and has had part of his pancreas removed, he is now a diabetic. he has survived prostate cancer and still has it, he has had an aneurism that almost burst this week but they got it in time and he just had a kidney removed this week as well, I have never in my life see someone go thru so much in such a short period of time in all my life. He is cut up and down his his body and all the way around, I doubt they can remove much more.
Ron is one great guy and what a survivor!!! he is with out a doubt one of the best employers I know of, he is always thinking of other people and not himself, Ron is a huge supporter of both you and your brother. The reason for my email is I don't know how often you visit the Orlando area but it would mean so much to him just to meet you, right now he is up at mayo clinic still getting worked on and hope he will be back at home soon, God willing maybe even will come to work for an hour or so. If you are ever in the Orlando area it would really be great for him to meet you and would really cheer him up.
He truly is a good guy and a great company.
 
thank you so much

To whom it may concern, 

 

I called the Governor’s office today to try and get an answer regarding an education issue that I have been asking about for three years and to date have found 

no one able or willing to answer my question.  I was transferred to the Dept. of Education where I have been many times before and once again told that they could offer no help.  After being transferred from office to office, and department to department, I still have found no one that could address my issue.  I then called the Governor’s office and asked to speak with the Governor and was told I needed to request it is writing, hence this e-mail.

 

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss briefly a question regarding state statute 1003.421  Recitation of the Declaration of Independence.—with the Governor as I have found no one in local or state government that will accept responsibility  regarding the enforcement of this statute.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing you this letter to plead for your help.  My name is Robert Marcelo and 10 years ago when I was 15 years old I committed a horrific crime. Since that time I served 3 years in prison, 1 year house arrest and 4 years of probation. I have served my time for my crime but I am still not able to live a normal life. Isn't the purpose of the criminal system to rehabilitate and reform?  I can not live a normal life and put this behind me because the judicial system will not allow me to. Honestly, most people who have been charged with similar offenses have not made it through all that time without having another criminal offense.  I have paid for my crime and since that time I have tried to do nothing but better my life.  
 
Recently I have been volunteering in the community with the elderly population and have decided that I would like to become a firefighter/paramedic, but because of my conviction I can not receive licensure within the state of Florida. Looking for a job when criminal background checks are a must is also quite a challenge. 
 
I recently contacted my lawyer Mr. Richard Sharpstein, who represented me 10 years ago. I had contacted Mr. Sharpstein in hopes that he would be able to help me either seal or expunge my criminal record, but do to the terms of my conviction, I am not able to do either of these. Mr. Sharpstein informed me that the only option is a governor's pardon. I am currently looking for legal representation to begin this process, but from what I understand this is a lengthy and political process.  
 
Governor Bush, I have done nothing but try to erase the terrible crimes that I committed when I was only a minor, but these charges seem to haunt me when I look for employment due to criminal background checks. I need your assistance to help me receive a pardon so that I can go to school to become a firefighter/paramedic and receive licensure in the state of Florida. I want to give back to the community. I hope that you will be able to help me, and I appreciate you taking the time to hear my case.  
 
Thank you, 
Robert Marcelo

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Thank you for choosing to take Derrick Smith's sentence commutation case under advisement.  My name is Brian Heibel and it was an honor to attend the Florida Board of Executive Clemency hearing today.  My wife Paula and I flew down here from Ohio (along with twenty two other family members) to attend the hearing in support of our nephew Derrick Smith.  We found comfort in the way you addressed the attendees/speakers with compassion and sincerity; it is encouraging to see public officials that truly have a servant’s heart.

 

For the last five years, Paula and I have made two trips to Tallahassee annually to see Derrick; and can bear witness that he has a very heavy heart and is extremely remorseful.  During our visits we have spent many hours talking, praying, and crying with him as he has expressed his sorrow, shame and regret.  Derrick’s primary focus is getting the opportunity to speak with peers regarding the consequences of drinking and driving.

 

We pray that you discover, through his videotape and extensive case file, that he is an exceptional young man who made a profoundly foolish decision six years ago.  We also pray that you and the Board feel stirred to grant Derrick's request for commutation of his sentence.

 

Please forward our kind regards to Attorney General Charlie Crist, CFO Tom Gallagher, and Commissioner Charles Bronson.  Thank you again for your consideration.

 
May God Bless and Prosper You,

School Board Appointment

 

I would like you to appoint to William Davison to the Broward County School Board.  Mr. Davison, AKA: Billy, The Playboy Preacher and Santa Clause, would be an outstanding appointee.  He would be an outstanding appointee to further your devious plan to destroy public education and punish the Democrats sitting on the board.   

 

Mr. Davison, besides being busted for stealing Playboy magazines at Public Library, also has been reported to terrorize a college student because he did not like what she wrote in a school paper.  He will be perfect to sit on the board that terrorizes it teacher if they speak out against any school board member or its failed policies.

 

Mr. Davison will also keep the Good Old Boy mentality alive.  He has been seen with an assistant principal, that he once lived with around town.  I am sure that he would pull some strings to make her a principal at one of our wonderful schools in Broward County—even though she would be a terrible one.  I do not want to mention her name, but she is the assistant principal at Pasadena Lakes Elementary. 

 

Even though Mr. Davison is a little eccentric, like showing up at a school board meeting dressed as Santa Clause, should not disqualify him to be a school board member.  We have a few others that are on the board that are eccentric--so he will fit right in.  But what really qualifies him as a board member he asked Dr. Till to resign while dressed as Santa Clause.  If he does not like Dr. Till he gets my vote.  Beside he can do just as well as Ms. Anderson and rubber stamp all of Dr. Till policies.

Subject:	UNITED STATES FLAG CODE REGULATIONS AS SPECIFIED IN 07-11-06 E-MAIL

Dear Governor Bush:
 
     On July 11th, 2006, I sent you an e-mail pertaining to the U.S. Flag Code Regulations. To this date I have not received a response.
 
     Therefore, I am sending the information again and I would greatly appreciate a response from you or a member of your staff.
 
     Info is as fols:
 
     The United States Flag Code specified that the Flag is to be flown at half-staff in mourning for designated principal governemnt leaders and upon Presidential Order.
 
     In the event of the death of a present or former official of the governemnt of any State territory or possession of the U.S., the Governor of that State territory, or possession, may proclaim that the National Flag be flown at half-staff.  And, that ONLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR A STATE GOVENOR HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE FLAG BE LOWERED  TO HALF-STAFF.
 
     The National Flag Foundations (NFF) has issued guidance on this subject in order to preclude good-faith misunderstanding or abuse of the Flag Code and Flag Etiquette, both of which are all too often violated by Civilian and Government Officials.  For example:  Janet Reno, while U.S. Attorney General, ordered the American Flag flown at half-staff in honor of several DEA Agents who had died.  The Flag Code does not give her the authority to issue that Order.  In addition, the Mayor of Pittsburg, Pa., ordered Flags flown at half-staff to honor the victims of a plane crash.  A well intentioned gesture, for which, no authority exists.
 
     The NFF points out tha these "GOOD-FAITH" misunderstandings are not to criticize or embarass anyone, but rather to head off growing trivilalization of this memorial salute, and to preserve the dignity and significance of flying the U.S. Flag at half-staff, and believe that proper respect for our flag must be maintained, no matter the circumstances.
 
     I feel that it is a violation of the Flag Code and Flag Etiquette when Sheriff Ed Dean of Marion County, orders the Flag flown at half-staff.  He recently ordered the Flag to half-staff upon the death of a retired Police Officer and has on similar occasions in the past, without, to my knowledge, authorization from you, the Governor.  He and other Officials take it upon themselves to lower our Flag to half-staff without the proper authorization.
 
     It appears to me that remedial action pertaining to the proper Flag Etiquette and Flag Code needs to be addressed.
 
     This is the information that I e-mailed to you on July 11, 2006, for which I have not received a reply.  Your attention to this is appreciated.
 
     Sincerely,

It was a pleasure and honor to meet you today at the Clemency hearing in Tallahassee.  There were some things that I wanted to say today, but I am not a great speaker, and wish that I could have.  We drove all the way from Gulf Breeze, but I didn't realize there were actual presentations in front of a room full of people.



It is in regard to my husband David Keenan, I would first like to say that David has matured into a wonderful husband and father over the past 11 years.  He has not drank in at least 10 years, he realized he couldn't, it just brought out the worst in him.  He chose to stop and went through Anger Management and it has been a wonderful life since.  He is a hard worker, great provider, and has also helped me grow up and mature into a successful business woman, and we have a great family life.  We now own 2 homes, have great kids, and alot of extras, I wouldn't have thought this possible 13 years ago. 



I really hope that you and Mr. Crist, Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Bronson and the rest of the panel allow David a second chance that I know he deserves!!! 



Thank you for your consideration.  Please feel free to email me or call me at your convenience.

Dear Mr. Bush

The residents in Broward County School Boards District 1 appreciate you efforts in appointing an interm School Board Member to finish out the term since the Board Member resigned.  We hope you select someone who lives in District 1, even for this short amount of time, so the citizens in the District are properly represented.  May I suggest you consider Mr. Victor Manuel Silverman,a District 1 resident and parent of 2 daughters in District 1 schools.  Mr Silverman is a true reflection of the community being of Latin Ancestry, having been raised through adoption, by a local Jewish family, and having served our country in the US Army.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Sarasoat-Bradenton's Director Piccolo and Board must be investigated !!

The Board that you appointed somehow mistakenly thought you appointed them to be Royalty !! 
They have given the airport Director a Salary package that is like that of yours Mr. Governor, he gets:
 
Salary of around $200,000
Car- Lexus
Free- travel for his wife on his business trips
House- Board purchased a $500,000. house that he lives in FREE
House- He pays NO living expenses on the house
House- he got $25,000. to furnish it
ETC......
 
How many people do you know get a house with their job ? A half million dollar one by the way.....and...if you were not aware, the board has arranged that when Piccolo leaves his job and that house is sold HE GET's THE PROFIT !!    This is on a house he never paid for, nor paid a dime to live in.....
 
Jeb, I support you and GW, I'm a good republican.....but this just stinks....this is what gives politics a bad name......
 
I urge you to explore this...I also urge you to fire the board and Fred Piccolo.
 
Thanks,
Tom Richardson

Good afternoon!  I’m not sure if you will remember us.  We are the Jones family.  You assisted us in our adoption back in 2002.  The process was moving very slowly.  Friends of ours emailed you about our situation and you got the system moving so that we could adopt our four girls.  We were also with you at your press conference in November, 2003 when you launched your “No Place Like Home” initiative and we did a few PSA’s about adoption. 

 

I just wanted to send you this email before you leave office to thank you again.  I have also attached a family photo of us that was taken late last year.  As you can see, our daughters are growing into beautiful young ladies.  They are all in advanced or honor classes at school, make very good grades, are involved in church activities and are overall happy, well adjusted girls.  We truly believe that they were meant to be ours and we can’t imagine life without them.  Thank you again for all that you did back then.  God bless you and good luck with everything you do in the future.

 

Warm regards,

Donna Jones

Honorable Governor Jed Bush, 

 

Please accept my personal gratitude for your continued support of our Armed Forces.  I was appointed as the Superintendent/Warden of Camp Delta located at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a year.  I was called to active duty from being the Superintendent/Warden of Indiana largest prison.  During my service at Camp Delta your visit and support of our Armed Forces Service Members was greatly appreciated by all of us who were there serving our Country.  I have been to Iraq twice and am currently employed in Afghanistan on behalf of the United States Government. I am developing doctrine and training the Afghan National Army so they can efficiently operate the Pol-e-Charkhi Prison.  This prison soon will incarcerate many of the detainees from Cuba and other terrorists currently being held by the United States.  

 

I was made aware of the unfortunate situation that has occurred within your Department of Correction.  I understand that you are seeking a person to fill the position of Secretary of Department of Correction.  I have attached my resume for your consideration for this very prestigious position.  I am also offering you my personal loyalty and the highest level of dedication in perform the duties of this position.  If given the opportunity I will serve with integrity, honor and will give you have my assurance that the Florida Department of Correction will achieve excellence. I have attached a copy of my resume for your consideration.  If needed my services are available to you.  Again, thank you for your support of our Armed Forces Service Members.  With Warm Personal Regards,   John

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
  I am in hopes of you or your staff at least taking the time to acknowledge this e-mail.  My  son wrote his essay, turned it in to the teacher and came home and said we needed to e-mail it to Tallahassee.  I have been trying since Friday to e-mail his essay and the consent form but to no avail.  I finally called a number which I found on one of the sites for the contest.  I explained to Jessica Welter our situation and that the web site was unresponsive.  That when you tried to click on the highlighted areas which the site tells you to do to complete the contest you go nowhere.  When you click on the Hispanic heritage site it goes directly to the black history month winners.  I was told that I should have typed in the actual email address to get to the site.  HOW WOULD SOMEONE KNOW THAT!!  I don't know computers inside and out.  I relied on the site to take me through the process.  Ms. Welter tried to go through the sites with me and finally apologized but said there was nothing else to do.  I felt your office should at least be aware of the time and effort my son put into his essay.  He is a straight A gifted student and works hard to maintain is 4.0 grade point in the 7th grade.  
 
In the future I would hope that your office or staff would make sure all sites are working correctly for us few parents who haven't yet stepped in to the future with the computer age.
 
 
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	Cecil Field

To whom it may concern,

 

I just thought I'd express my opposition to the Navy's return to Cecil.  I admit I'm not for the return for personal reasons. After all, I just moved back to the area last year and spent $283,000 on my new home. If I'd known there was a possibility of the Navy's return, I'd never have put such an investment in the area.

 

It's scary! Not just for me, but to many business and home owners would have invested in the area. 

 

The area has taken off in terms of development, and I hope that the citizens of Jacksonville will recognize the negative impact that the Navy's return would have on the Economic development of the Westside.

 

Thanks, and please help keep the Navy out of Cecil,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
First of all I am writing this note to thank you for the kind letter of best wishes sent this past March upon my installation as senior pastor of the Nassau Nazarene Fellowship Church in Yulee, Florida.  
 
I am planning to have the letter framed so that it can be displayed in my office.  Having pastored in the Washington D.C. area a few years prior to this present assignment I am aware that congressmen, senators, as well as some Pentegon personnel have a personal "coin."  I was wondering if you might have some type of "coin?" If so, I would truly treasure receiving such a gift which would then be framed along with the letter.
 
Secondly, I am writing this note to invite you to attend a special Military Appreciation Sunday that our church will be hosting to honor the brave men and women in our area who are serving our country.  We would be delighted for you to extend words of greetings and appreciation to our military personnel.  If you are not available to attend we would still appreciate a letter of greeting that could be read during the service.  The date for this service will be Sunday, November 12, 2006, at 10:45 a.m.
 
Thank you for the outstanding leadership given to this great state.  You are appreciated and prayed for daily.

Hello Carolyn:

    

Thank you taking the time to speak with me this morning at 11:00 a.m.  At this time I am respectfully requesting a 17 minute opportunity to speak with the Governor regarding the ongoing negative effect of the “Alleged Mexican Stolen Vehicle Atrocity of 1999.”  He will be very surprised to know that the issue is still ongoing.  Since my original notification to his office in July, 1999 I have asked to meet with him, however none of my requests have been fruitful.     DHSMV has not fulfilled its promise per the Mediation Agreement of April 19, 2001.  It is my understanding that the Governor is the Executive Officer of the State overseeing statewide departments and agencies.  Please schedule the appointment soon.  The legacy of a Governor is very important and my legacy to my children is important as well.  Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
It's only a week after the newly elected government in Yankeetown was left on their own, and these individuals are breaking law after law. There were a dozen people in town hall going through protected files, the old town assistant clerk was running the office without being formally hired, and the old mayor J. Wald was prominent with the group.
 
The meetings are being run nightly with obvious sunshine law issues.  Those citizens who wish to address the meeting with a disagreeing remark are refused or heckled out of the building.  Simply put, the new self appointed moderator handles descent with the utterance "shut up". This group of leftwing activists have with your assistance taken over the town for their specific agenda. We need the FDLE back with a new perspective. To look at all those individuals who did all the yelling, lying, and wrongful accusing the last time they were here. These people are back in the streets making a statement to all those who disagree with them.  Getting in our faces with fake smiles, aggressive salutations, and plain old arrogant physical posturing as they block the street egress. 
 
I've been a small business person in Yankeetown for 18 years. One of the largest tax payers, and keep what had been referred to as the most beautiful business property in town. Now I'm  simply looking for a way out of this sick place.  I was a partner of visitflorida.com, now I refuse to advertise this town. Just look at the new governments web site (saveyankeetown.com) and get a feeling for the kind of vacation you may able to have amongst these aggressive misfits of malcontent.
 
You need to fix this problem now.  Not next week. Dissolve this towns charter and place the governing issues in Levy counties hands. The county, who already repairs our streets could easily fix the dysfunctional fire and water departments.  Please take some action now.  
 
Regards,

Dear Mr. Bush,



            I am 34 years old and work full time for the Crown 
Automotive Dealership Group as an internal auditor.  I have lived in 
Florida since I was six years old.  I am also a full time student as 
St. Petersburg College in St. Petersburg, Florida and will be 
graduating next year with an Associates Degree in Business 
Administration.  

Last semester one of my college courses was American Government. I had 
a business trip to Tallahassee and had requested to meet with you for 
lunch. However, you were not available as you were out of town. Now, I 
finished my American Government class (I received an A), but am still 
interested in meeting with you. I am scheduled to be in Tallahassee 
next week, September 25th – September 29th.  I am sorry about the 
short notice, but I was hoping that this time you might be available 
to meet with me. You have to eat right, lunch maybe?  I do not have a 
political or media related agenda. Perhaps you would like to get out 
the office and not talk about politics for a short time. I think it 
would be really cool to talk to you about your plans for the future. I 
know that your term is quickly coming to an end, what are you planning 
to do next?  To be honest with you my personal agenda would be simply 
for bragging rights of having lunch with the Governor. It would be 
cool to be able to tell friends, classmates, teachers, co-workers and 
family members that I had lunch with the Governor of the State of 
Florida, who also happens to be the brother of the current President 
of the United States and the son of a former president.  What is in 
this for you?  Well, I am not a celebrity, politician or activist; so 
I can’t offer anything to you that those persons would be able to 
offer; I will tell you I am a Florida resident, voter and great person 
who would be eternally grateful for the opportunity just to meet you 
in person. 

I understand if you are busy, thanks in advance for the consideration.

Dear Governor,
I am writing to ask that you re-evaluate the death sentence of Clarence Hill, the man who our honorable state is seeking to execute this afternoon at 6:00. I ask that you employ your power as governor to change Clarence's sentence to life without parole. In this hour of need I pray that you would even evoke your personal religious beliefs. The Savior of our universe came to save...he gave life, he did not destroy it. I am by no means a religious fanatic, In fact I havent gone to church in the past month, but I do love God. And the greatest action of love to God, is to love others. Please love your God today, by respecting his command to love your neighbor as yourself, you are your brothers keeper--please save Clarence's life.

Honorable Governor Bush,
 
I live in Bradenton, and I am very concerned that the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Board is way over it's head....the appointees have no real airport/airline experience. They have given Mr. Fred Piccolo a:
 -salary of nearly $200,000. which if you look at other US airports of like size is way too high
 -a FREE $500,000. house to live in...and, he gets the profit above purchase price when he leaves office, all without paying a dime..he also got $20,000+ dollars for furnishings...
 -all household expenses are paid for-FREE Living expenses
 -A FREE Lexus to drive as his own car
 -his wife can go on business trips with Mr Piccolo FREE
 
This Board is making business decisions that are way out of control. I support You, Gov. Bush..and I am sending you this before this blows up, as you appointed the board.
Thanks,
Tom Richardson

Subject:	[*] Yankeetown's NEW GOVERNMENTs  FAILURE

Dear Governor Bush,

You are painfully aware of the lack of proper government in Yankeetown. Your executive order spoke clearly that you would not tolerate further unrest, civil disobedience, nor improper government actions. That is exactly what you have right now in Yankeetown, even after your efforts with state assistance. As time passes more improprieties will become evident as the newly elected officials come under close scrutiny based on their illegal actions and forceful personal rule as evidenced by three people making decisions in direct contradiction to your sunshine rules and regulations. 

You have a choice to make now. Do you end it all by withdrawing Yankeetown’s charter, or do you stay away and let the fighting continue for months or years, after which our town will surely be in pieces and in need of help anyway.

You should withdraw the charter today. I will speak up and support you when you do. As you could see by the voting results in the past elections, there are many people in our town who do not want to see us get drawn into a lawsuit over development. Development is going to happen sooner or later, so why not make the best of it? As a small business owner in Yankeetown, I’ve had it with all the negative press these leftwing activists have gained. It has just about sunk my business which relies on travelers and vacationers who are not returning to Yankeetown based on the aggressive nature of the anti development crowd.

Our town government has been deliberately dismantled by a bunch of malcontents and misfits that won’t listen to anyone who isn’t in their little ruling den. They will (have) run Yankeetown into a hole so large it will never recover. For the sake of my business and others here, shut down this dysfunctional government now, and transfer power over to Levy County where a government exists that can manage our water and fire services. After all, the state has asked the town to correct the water problem on numerous occasions, but the very people in charge now have publicly stated that they rather drink poison water than allow development to occur.

The time to act is right now, today. These people act as if they have total impunity from the law and your office. 

Regards,

Carl Hanover

Dear Governor Bush,

 

It is with deep regret that I must tender my resignation as a member of the Florida Arts Council.  Earlier this month my wife Joanne was diagnosed with Lymphoma, and last week it was confirmed malignant.  The good news is that it is treatable with an excellent track record of success, but we will be spending much of the coming season up North while she undergoes treatment.  I therefore will be unable to fulfill my duties as prescribed by your appointment.

 

I want to tell you how much I appreciated your trust in me and your response when your help was needed to support the integrity of FAC.

 

Throughout my two terms, I have enjoyed working with JuDee Pettijohn, Sandy Shaughnessy and their most capable staff at the Division of Cultural Affairs.  I have made new friends both among the staff and my fellow FAC members and look forward to continuing serve the arts in Florida once our tribulations have passed.

 

I do hope our paths will cross, perhaps if you come to Hobe Sound to visit your Uncle Bucky.

 

With best personal regards to you and yours.

 

Sincerely,

Governor Bush, 
    With the Mayor of Yankeetown's resignation she asked you to pull our charter and put us under the county.  You gave us an election and we proved the majority of voters were not happy with what was going on. Please continue to work with us and let us prove to you that the majority can "save Yankeetown".  You gave us an Emergency Financial Board that got the mess from the Mayor's rule straightened out. Thank you for those members and their work.
 
    As a 45 year resident, retired Postmaster, and newspaper reporter I have witnessed this history first hand sitting on the front row at most all meetings. As a reporter, under the rule of Mayor Johannesson, everyone has been denied access to ALL public documents (tapes and papers), myself since July 31st, 2006, the first meeting of your appointed board. There is no "mob", "radicals", "misfits", just citizens trying to regain the democratic process from a Mayor and council that denied us our rights to public documents, the right of freedom of speech at meetings and an open democratic government.
 
    We have 3 intelligent elected council persons elected by a 2 to 1 majority of the town who ran on the promise of open democratic government. They are not opposed to development as long as they go by the zoning. We have an election coming up Oct 31 where we will elect 3 council and a mayor giving us a full ruling body again. 
 
    You have taken us this far. Please support us in the final steps to restore democracy in our beloved Yankeetown.

How is the investigation into the Leesburg CAP Building debacle coming?

This was a “dirty deal” not only from the standpoint of the builders/donators of the building, EAA Chapter 534 and the Lake County Aviation Association, but also from the vantage point of the law... which begs a few questions:

Was there a very elaborate “set up” to make the building appear to be nearly derelict?

Why did CAP’s Florida Wing GIVE away a building worth between $500,000 and 750,000?  Did money change hands under some table?

It is all very strange and answers need to be forthcoming.

We are inviting a large crowd and also encouraging friends in the Faith Community to attend so they can get to know Katherine.
Please consider this an invitation to attend.
I'll be delighted to mail you a formal invitation if the date works for your schedule.
Obviously it would be an honor for us if you are able and choose to attend!
However, it's not about you honoring Linda and me!!!
It's about you supporting Katherine!!!!!
I am of the opinion that she has earned our support and respect.
If you are unable to attend, please consider finding a way to help Katherine bring Florida better representation to US Senate than we currently receive.
BTW, I consider Senator Nelson to be a very honorable man! He's just too liberal for Florida.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to both thank you for what you have done in giving the electorate in Yankeetown the privelege of electing their own government, and to urge you to allow the process to continue.  Please, do not revoke the town charter as the recently resigned "mayor" has desperately requested.  
 
For the first time in years the vast majority of citizens of Yankeetown feel that they are in control of their own destiny.  The now resigned mayor, instead of being "a part of" the town, has been "apart from" the town.  The recently resigned mayor was elected approximately a year ago, unopposed, while the developer who initiated this situation was "secretly negotiating" with at least two if not more of the town council members (the mayor was a member of that council).  Instead of clearing the air and explaining how this happened, she set off on a course that she now acknowledges of attempting to appease the developer with the primary goal being to avoid litigation.  Yankeetown deserves more than appeasement...Yankeetown deserves what you have given it, the ability to make the decisions that will affect it's future in an open and honest political atmosphere.  
 
Our town council now has a quorum of three, with another election approaching in a month that will fill the two open council seats.  Please allow the good and honest folks of Yankeetown to continue down the road you have graciously provided, since your allowing an election, an honest and informed election, has given us a light at the end of our tunnel.  Please allow us to continue to pursue our own destiny.  
 
John Ward Smith
 
 
P.S.  This has nothing to do with Yankeetown, but I wanted to tell you how highly I think of your father.  I had met your father at a couple of political fundraisers, but I obviously didn't know him.  Then about 10 years ago a good friend of mine who was a Pearl Harbor survivor (and who your father had called every year while in office) was dying of cancer.  My law partner wrote to your father, who was apparently in Africa on a hunting/fishing trip with his grandchildren.  Your father wrote a hand written letter to Tom that brought tears to his eyes.  Your father took time from his busy schedule to make an old war veteran's day.  He had no political motive, but instead was motivated by his decency as a human being (and perhaps as a fellow veteran of the Pacific theatre).  You have to be exceedingly proud.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 
I am writing to you on behalf of a young man, Mark Berrios, who has been in our prison system for ten years,since he was a child. 
Without executive clemency from you he will be there for the rest of his life. I appealed to Governor Chiles at the time of Mark's conviction over ten years ago for clemency to no avail.
 
Mark was convicted of murdering a known pedophile whom Mark alleges molested him.
 
While I do not condone murder, I painfully question the harshness of  the penalty that this young man is paying.
 
I realize that life in prison with no chance of parole was the only possible penalty upon conviction, but I also realize that before you leave office you have the right, along with the parole board to show the mercy that we expect of God when we are judged, to grant clemency to this young man who has spent  more than two fifths of his life in prison for a crime  that was committed by a scared young boy.
 
Please be merciful.
 
Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am a death penalty supporter who feels this penalty is quite 
justified in some cases.  I was very happy when Ted Bundy was executed 
and also support the execution of the man who killed five women at the 
University of Florida in 1990.  I believe most death row inmates 
deserve to be there.

I CONDEMN Mr. Hill for murdering a police officer.  

However, two reasons lead me to believe you should spare Clarence 
Hill's life.   One, he was sentenced to death by a close jury vote of 
7-5.  I don't believe people should be sentenced to death by such a 
close margin in general.  Two, Mr. Hill has a mitigating circumstance 
in that he was a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from 
his service in the military in Vietnam.  

For these reasons I urge you to grant clemency to Mr. Hill and sentence 
him to life in prison without parole possibility.  Thank you for your 
urgent action on this immediate matter.

 Governor Bush:

A friend sent me an article from the Birmingham News, in Alabama.  I 
inclose the article for your perusal.  But to give a brief synopsis, it 
reports that Alabama has joined in a program with the federal government, 
that with training, it allows local law enforcement in Alabama to 
participate in and enforce immigration laws.  The article also talks about 
the specific cities that have holding facilities that are used to retain 
suspects.   

This sounds like an excellent program and I would like to see Florida 
participating in this.  Will you take the necessary steps to set this 
program up for the state of Florida?  I hope that you will. 

 While Florida has held its arms open to many who have sought sanctuary in 
our wonderful country, we have also seen a huge increase in illegal 
immigrants that have placed a burden on our schools, medical facilities, 
communty services and treasuries.  We can no longer afford to keep our 
arms open for those living in peril in other countries, if we do not start 
fully enforcing our immigration laws.  Will you serve our state's best 
interests and institute this program?  Please?

Following is the article that I referenced.

Two cities to hold immigrants

Saturday, September 09, 2006 
MIKE CASON
News staff writer 

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will set up facilities in 
Montgomery and Dothan to temporarily detain and investigate those 
suspected of being illegal immigrants. 

The facilities, modular buildings of about 2,000 square feet, will be used 
by state troopers who have completed special training in immigration law 
and procedures, said Roland Jones, assistant special agent in charge of 
the ICE Office of Investigations in Gulfport, Miss. 

Equipment in the facilities will allow state troopers to identify suspects 
through digital finger scans and photographs checked against national data 
bases. 

The same technology is used by ICE agents at their offices in Birmingham 
and Mobile. 

Col. Mike Coppage, director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety, 
said he expects the facilities to be in place in about six weeks. 

Jones said ICE will pay for the buildings but did not know the cost. The 
facilities will be the only ones of their kind in the state. 

Alabama is one of a handful of states to enter agreements with the federal 
government to allow state or local police to enforce immigration laws 
within certain restrictions. 

Under the Alabama agreement, state troopers who have completed a training 
course can detain those suspected of being illegal immigrants, provided 
that they encounter those suspects during the course of normal law 
enforcement, such as issuing a speeding ticket or investigating an 
accident. 

The state troopers are the only Alabama police agency who have entered an 
agreement with ICE for immigration enforcement. Fifty-eight active state 
troopers have completed the five-week course. The agreement does not allow 
troopers to seek out illegal immigrants at businesses, construction sites 
or other workplaces. 

Jones said the Montgomery and Dothan facilities will have holding cells 
for male and female suspects. They will not be for overnight detention. If 
an investigation determines that a suspect needs to be detained because of 
an immigration violation, ICE will transport them to the Etowah County 
Detention Center in Gadsden, Jones said. ICE also has an agreement with 
the privately owned Perry County Correctional Center, near Uniontown, to 
house illegal immigrants awaiting hearings or deportation. 

Jones said he did not know of plans for any more facilities after the ones 
in Dothan and Montgomery. He said the two cities were picked partly 
because their location would improve the efficiency of processing 
immigration suspects. 

"What ICE is trying to do is provide some of this infrastructure 
throughout the state," Jones said.

I am glad you have a Hispanic heritage essay contest. I have participated every year that I have known about it. All the years that I have done it I have given the essays to my teacher and she has mailed them to you. This year I handed the essay to my teacher on Friday.  Today she told me that I should have sent it via email. I was very disappointed to hear this.  I tried to talk to Ms.Nadia but she wasn't there. I talked to her assistant and asked if I could still e-mail it she said no.
 
I wanted you to have my essay anyway. 
 
This contest is always important to me because I come from a Hispanic family.  Our heritage is something that I am proud of and is a part of my life.
 
Thank you for your time.

            This is Kevin Barrett, one of your 2006/2007 Gubernatorial Fellows. First of all, I would just like to take this opportunity to thank you for giving me this great opportunity. Even in the short time that I have been here I have learned so much, so I can only imagine how much more I am going to have the opportunity to learn over the next year. I would also like to thank you for coming to talk with the Fellows class a couple of weeks ago. It was a great discussion and I enjoyed it very much. I look forward to talking with you again in the future.

            Secondly, I do have one quick question to ask you. During our discussion with you, one of the other fellows, Tyler, asked you what books you are currently reading and you listed a couple. I recently finished the book that I was reading and I am looking to start another one, and one of the books you mentioned seemed very interesting. I was wondering if you could let me know the title and author again. I don't quite remember much of the details about the book, but you mentioned that it was about a man who was given the opportunity to meet inspirational people from the past such as Gandhi, Moses, Abraham Lincoln and others. I'm sorry if that is a very vague description but hopefully it was enough to remind you of the book I am referring to. 

 

Thanks you again for all of your help and support (and of course for the book reference)

 

Kevin Barrett

Dear Governor Bush:  I am writing to ask that you not allow the execution of Clarence Hill.  He was clearly involved in a crime that resulted in the death of a law officer.  At the time this crime was committed Hill was under the influence of drugs.  Executing him would accomplish nothing that life in prison would not accomplish.  Please intervene  and grant mercy.  Thank you.  Sincerely, Jamie Rodriquez

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
  I am in hopes of you or your staff at least taking the time to acknowledge this e-mail.  My  son wrote his essay, turned it in to the teacher and came home and said we needed to e-mail it to Tallahassee.  I have been trying since Friday to e-mail his essay and the consent form but to no avail.  I finally called a number which I found on one of the sites for the contest.  I explained to Jessica Welter our situation and that the web site was unresponsive.  That when you tried to click on the highlighted areas which the site tells you to do to complete the contest you go nowhere.  When you click on the Hispanic heritage site it goes directly to the black history month winners.  I was told that I should have typed in the actual email address to get to the site.  HOW WOULD SOMEONE KNOW THAT!!  I don't know computers inside and out.  I relied on the site to take me through the process.  Ms. Welter tried to go through the sites with me and finally apologized but said there was nothing else to do.  I felt your office should at least be aware of the time and effort my son put into his essay.  He is a straight A gifted student and works hard to maintain is 4.0 grade point in the 7th grade.  
 
In the future I would hope that your office or staff would make sure all sites are working correctly for us few parents who haven't yet stepped in to the future with the computer age.
 
 
 
Sincerely,

I have spoken to one of your assistance regarding a specific matter and would like to request a few minutes of your time to discuss this with you.
 
The nature and background to the issue is that of my Residence combined with Property Tax's.
 
I moved to Clearwater in June 04 with my wife and 2 children from the UK. I am sponsored by my employer and have a VISA which is in the process of review for a Green Card. Until such a time as my application is accepted my property tax's increase at a phenomenal rate as I am unable to participate in the 'Save Our Homes' project as I am not considered a resident.
 
At this stage I am bemused as to what resident means. (1) We live here 365 days a year, (2) The home is a permanent residence and not a vacation home, (3) I get paid in US $'s and pay tax's as a permanent resident and (4) My children attend local schools.
 
Last year my property tax's increased by $4k and this year by a further $3.5k, with no increase in the services that I receive. Unfortunately my salary does not increase at such rates.
At this stage we are having to seriously consider relocating to enable us to maintain our standard of living.
 
I know as fact that if a US Citizen was to move to the UK then they would not be discriminated against as we are.
 
I look forward to speaking with you.

 Dear Governor,
 
I am an american with american parents.  And right now, and never, will this immigration bill be an answer to anything.
 
This country is made of americans who were once immigrants.  The only ones that have a right to be here are american indians and therefore, those english/spanish descents should be thrown out as well whether they have citizenship or not. "One nation under God."
 
 
If it wasn't for immigrants that make up the entirety of this country, this country wouldn't be where it is today.
This isn't a solution.  Families will be broken apart, businesses will lose business and lose employees.  This is vital in a vital time.
 
I as an american, do not support taking immigrants out.
 
I hope my word means anything.
 
If God's word means anything, He loves us all equally and we are all brother's in Christ as all nation's in one.
 
God wants unity and humbleness.
 
I guarantee, that this nation will not be blessed under God with the immigration bill taking immigrants out.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Godbless,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I ask that you stop the execution of Clarence Hill. Mr.Hill's killing of a police officer was inexcusable, and I do not ask that Mr. Hill be released. However, I do ask that we stop committing murder now to avenge murder past.  Mr. Hill's action was wrong; the state's action in killing him will be equally wrong.  
 
Don Cabana, former warden of Mississippi State Prison at Parchman, who oversaw many executions, said, "Americans do not have the right to ask other Americans to take a life."  We are asking corrections officers to strap Mr. Hill to a gurney and take his life. I support Mr. Cabana's sentiment and ask you to consider it.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am 73 years old. Since I was in grade school I have wondered what
executions by governments accomplish. How can killing people show that
killing is a bad thing to do? Nothing has convinced me that the death
penalty is right. Life imprison with no parole even costs less.

Please please stay the execution of Clarence Hill. You have said that you
are following the law. It is a bad law. Let's have a moratorium and work
toward  eventual elimination of the death penalty. I want us to join the
nations of the world that recognize the death penalty as being barbaric.
Florida can set an example for other states.

Subject:	FDLE Commissioner


Dear Gov. Bush, 

        I need to preface this by stating that I've not been asked to write this, it is of my own volition and is the result in my interest in the future FDLE Commissioner being the most qualified for our State.

        
        I am sending this information to you, because I know you have many difficult decisions to make, daily, and one of the most important in the coming days is the appointment of a permanent Commissioner for FDLE.  First, let me say that FDLE is a fine organization that does an exceptional job in assisting local agencies.  It has been my experience that the leadership of the Dept. of Law Enforcement is an important factor in how policing is conducted on a day to day basis throughout the state.   Moreover, that leadership must have credibility with police officers.  I know that you will make this appointment based on the needs of the State and the ability of the individual to instill confidence and maintain the highest ethical standards.

        I am taking it upon myself as a citizen to suggest the name of Everett Rice, former Pinellas County Sheriff, for this position.  I have been in policing in this state for over 35 years and have found Everett to be a consumate professional with the highest of ethical standards.   It is probably unusual for a Police Chief to forward the name of a Sheriff for this position, but in my fifteen years of working with Everett on everything from street crime issues to legislation, I can tell you that his decision making has always been in the best interest of  the citizens he serves.  I know that Everett is a lawyer and that he has served in the House of Representatives,  and he is an excellent administrator, but his strongest asset is that he is a cop, and a good one.  In my business, that is high praise.  He has never compromised his principles or the law for political expediency.  Everett is respected in all areas of law enforcement and his efforts have contributed greatly to making the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office one of the best in the country.

          It is important that the Commissioner of FDLE understand that what they do, the legislation they support and the role they play in the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission impacts every officer, probation officer and correction officer in Florida.

        I am just a small town police chief,  but I can tell you that this appointment will impact ALL small town police chief's and there are many of us.  Everett understands the constraints and the responsibilities we share.   More than once in these past years I've had occasion to call on Sheriff Rice for assistance and I have never  been let down, even a small town police chief.   I believe he would serve the State well.  Regardless of your decision, I have faith in your judgement.  Thank you for hearing me out.  If I can ever be of service, please do not hesitate to give me that opportunity.

I am writing to ask you to stay the execution of Clarence Hill. Our Catholic faith teaches us that God alone is the author of life, and that each human being is a creature made in the image and likeness of God. 

 

Capital Punishment is inappropriate and unacceptable in today’s world. Statistics show that it is not a deterrent to violent crime, and yet its costs cause an undue burden to taxpayers. Our Florida courts have not even ruled yet on the conjecture that the injection chemicals are too painful and amount to cruel and unusual punishment.

 

Please do what you must know in your heart is right. Stay the execution of Clarence Hill and impose a moratorium on this unjust practice in our state.

I am writing you regarding Clarence Hill because I very much value Human life. 
Regardless of this person's strategies that brought him to this punitive place you keep him.  He was trying to meet his basic human needs.  I am asking for your patience and forgiveness of this person.  I ask you, is it worth a person's life?  This is a man, a son, a brother, a father, a neighbor.
This is a human being, heart and bones like yourself.   
Your strategy (our system's strategy) for justice is perhaps just as ill as his was for survival.... for life.

Dear Governor Bush, 

Hi. I know that the end is near, too bad. I have to say, we shared some good times and some not so good times. But to me that is typical government business. Overall, I feel that you did a very good job, except one thing. You did not give me an opportunity to introduce a new business for the state of Florida. Scrippt Research was the main issue at the time, and my suggestion was just peanuts. 

Well I wish to bring to your attention, here three years later, instead of me trying to contact ourside businesses to Florida, they have called me. It is an aircraft company wishing to set up somewhere in Florida. I recommended Port St. Lucie in St. Lucie County, as I described the potential and lay out of the area logistically. A population of over 142 thousand now, business needs to grow along with the population. 

I have written to the Vice-Mayor and she is very interested to see what can be brought to the table. I wish to set up a presentation before all the governors of each state, our island neighbors and countries along the Gulf Coast as this could be of great value to them as well. Once, I sit down with the Vice-Mayor (potentially Mayor in November) and make the arrangements for such a presentation, I would hope that you would attend and invite your fellow governors or their representatives. I hope to have more details at a later time once times and dates can be satisfied, 

I will be writing to Sen Ken Pruitt also to add maybe some much needed horsepower to the meeting. If you can add some horsepower, of course that would be welcomed also. 

I don't know what your future plans will be once you step down from office, but once again, as always. I will tell you, if there is anything that I can assist you with, give me a call. In case my number has been lost, here it is once again. Best regards and good luck Governor.

Dear Governor Bush,
Have written to you before on Behalf of Joe Grammer DA in Panama City Florida in favor of him for a Judge ship.  Once again I am brought back into the reliving my husbands death from 1996,  JOhn E Dwyer M.D..  Attached is a letter I wrote in 2000, when Goodwin was asking for re-sentencing due to an error by the Florida legislature.  My feelings are identical as they were in 1996 , 2000 and 2001 when he was released and then rearrested but his probation for 9 years was dropped.  So, now in 2006 Goodwin is asking for his civil rights back.  I say no.   If this is the only punishment we have left for the death of my husband, then it needs to be held.  
 
I can not make the trip back out to Florida this time.  I now live in New Mexico, and my father is suffering from cancer.  It would be too great of a hardship to make the trip.  Please let some part of justice remain intact.  Thank you for taking the time to hear more of the story than what is allowed in the  5 minutes allowed the victims.
 
Sincerely yours

Dear Governor,

I write to you regarding Clarence Hill who is scheduled to be executed on 20
September 2006.

Clarence Hill is scheduled to be executed although there's an appeal
pending. There are serious doubts regarding lethal injection whether it is
cruel and unusual punishment. An execution of Clarence Hill would be in
violation of international standards and also of the right to life as
proclaimed in the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

I urgently request that you grant a stay and commute the death sentence of
Clarence Hill.

Thank you for your time and attention in this very serious matter.

Subject:	Hero Hugs

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My name is Bailey and I am ten-years-old and I live in Niceville, Florida.  When I was seven I started an organization called Hero Hugs that sends care packages to soldiers serving in Iraq.  So far I have sent more then 16,000 packages valued at more than $145,000 to our troops.  I also have a bear named Hero I made at Build-A-Bear Workshop I sent to the soldiers to keep them company.  When the soldiers started sending me photos of Hero being a soldier, I thought of a way to help kids who have a family member serving in Iraq.  The Adventures of Hero show kids in a kid friendly way what life is really like for our soldiers in Iraq and kids are less scared about their mom or dad being there.  I have won lots of awards and recently teamed up with the Department of Defense and America Supports You to be sure our soldiers know people are thinking of them.
 
The reason I am writing you is because I would really like to meet you and would like for Hero to meet you too.  After three years in Iraq, some soldiers surprised me and brought Hero home for some R&R because they knew I missed him.  Hero has had his photo with a lot of famous people and he is a pretty famous bear.  I even wrote a book about him I am hoping to have published soon.  Since you have been my state's Governor during the time Hero was in Iraq, I thought it would be really cool for Hero to get to meet you and have a photo of you with me and Hero for his scrapbook.  Eventually Hero will probably go to a museum and I think a photo with our state's Governor would be a special part of his collection.
 
I know you are really busy, but I only live a few hours away and I am sure my mom would bring me over to Tallahassee if you could find time to meet Hero.  My fourth grade visited the capitol last year and I hoped we would meet you then, but you had some important meetings that day.  Or it would be really cool if you wanted to visit my school which is Longwood Elementary in Shalimar, Florida and help me and my classmates pack some of the packages for the soldiers.  I always thought it would be good if your brother the President could help us pack packages because so many people don't agree with us being in Iraq and maybe if they saw him helping kids pack packages for the soldiers they would at least remember that we should always think of our soldiers even if we don't like what they are doing or how they do it.  Our soldiers are just trying to make the world a better place for us to live in.  It might make some big people change their minds about things.  
 
The holidays are coming up and that is a really hard time for the soldiers.  Getting our packages really help them feel better.  A lot of soldiers from Florida have gotten a package from Hero Hugs and I bet one of them would be especially surprised if they got one with a card signed by our governor.  And maybe seeing you help us would encourage more people to be sure and do something special for our soldiers during the holidays since people look up to you.  I partly started Hero Hugs after I saw some people being mean to soldiers after a hurricane.  The soldiers were passing out ice and water and people were just complaining about the lines being too long and not getting enough.  They forgot I think that the soldiers were just there trying to help us.  We should have been thanking them instead because they could have been home with their families and power instead of there trying to help us.
 
I really hope you will have time to meet me and Hero or visit my class and help with packages before you leave office.  It would really mean a lot to us.
 
Sincerely,
Bailey Reese

Thanks again for taking the time to talk with me in the past year and I look forward to staying in

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Please consider selecting an interim School Board District 1 member (Broward) who actually lives in the District for proper representation of the citizens.
 
As a local restaurant business owner, I highly recommend Mr. Victor Silverman. He is a wonderful parent whose kids are in District 1 schools, he is Latino (Dominican born) but adopted and raised by a local Jewish family, and a Republican who subscribes to the values as many in the military do. Consequently, he is representative of the demographics in District 1. I know the office is for only a few weeks. But what a way to reward a naturalized citizen who volunteered and served 6 years in the US Army 82nd Airborne by giving him this honor to serve the District 1 community. Also, it would please most folks----people are supportive of folks who served in the military, he has a story of coming from a home in the Dominican that had no electric, no running water, etc. A good man & dad with a good story....and a regular guy reflective of the District 1 population.
 
Thank you.

Subject:	EGLIN

It is beginning to appear that it will take an act of Congress to stop the move of the 46th Test Wing from Eglin to Edwards.  If I didn’t know that the figures being used to justify this move are skewed, and didn’t feel that this is a huge mistake for national security, I might not be as upset.  Consider this one example:

 

One major Eglin facility slated to be closed next year under this plan is making money for the Test Wing, and will continue to for at least the next five years.  To close the facility would cost nearly $20 million, so it was decided to just “mothball” it instead.  The logic is that of the money it takes in, about $1-million is Air Force money that will no longer be spent.  However, it will cost about $2.2-million a year to mothball it (being kept quiet) so end result is the Government will spend $2.2-million a year in order to save $1-million.

 

Even people out west are pointing out that they can’t support the work they have already, and routinely have been sending work to Eglin for years.  They want to know how they are going to be expected to do what they have now, plus all they send to us, plus all the Eglin work also.

 

Please do all you can to stop this move that makes no sense!  PLEASE call the secretary, the President, or whomsoever it takes!

 

Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I would like to encourage your appointment of Victor Silverman to the vacant District 1 School Board seat in Broward County.  I believe it is important to appoint someone who lives within the district, is politically neutral, and promises not to use their temporary position as a catapult for a November election 

 

As a parent of school age children and a product of the Broward school system, he will have some insight that the current Board members do not have.   His experience in the military and working within a large team can only add, if only for awhile, to the pool of knowledge that guides the system.

( Austin , TX ) In conjunction with National Suicide Prevention Week, the independent film, jumping off bridges, will screen in over 20 cities across the United States from August through November.  Storie Productions will partner with local and national suicide prevention organizations, mental health awareness groups and organizations that deal with grief and loss to use jumping off bridges in an outreach effort to spread awareness.  The film will screen in Tallahassee , FL the weekend of October 6th and 7th at the All Saints Theater through the Tallahassee Film Society. 

 

Inspired by invincible friendships, junior high journal entries, heart breaking crushes and the complexities of losing loved ones, jumping off bridges follows a carefree, adventurous group of four best friends deep in the trenches of adolescence.   Written and directed by award-winning filmmaker, Kat Candler (cicadas, Roberta Wells ), the film features Michael Emerson (Henry Gale on the hit television series LOST) and Rhett Wilkins from the Sundance darling, The Puffy Chair .  Since its festival premiere at the 2006 South By Southwest Film Festival, jumping off bridges has enjoyed sold out screenings and rave reviews.   Lauded by the Austin Chronicle as "a realistic narrative portrait of love, death, and human debris as anything you're ever likely to see onscreen."   

 

In many cities, a Q&A panel of experts will follow the screening to discuss suicide and mental health issues, statistics, warning signs and preventative measures. 

 

The script was a finalist in the 2002 Chesterfield Fellowship, a participant in the 2002 IFP Market (Emerging Narrative) and a Semi-Finalist in the 2002 Sundance Screenwriter's Lab. The film was a recipient of a 2005 Texas Filmmaker's Production Fund Grant and a participant in the 2005 IFP Rough Cuts Lab.

What the critics are saying …

 

" Austin filmmaker Kat Candler is one of the most astute observers of teenage behavior working behind a camera today, and jumping off bridges , her powerful, resonant examination into the impact of suicide on those left behind is as realistic a narrative portrait of love, death, and human debris as anything you're ever likely to see onscreen." -- The Austin Chronicle 

  

"Candler demonstrated a deep understanding of teen anxiety, angst and alienation. An emotional, smart movie." -- Moving Pictures Magazine 

  

"Kat Candler's moving Austin-made teen drama has enjoyed sold-out crowds and raves." -- Austin American-Statesman 

 

"Candler's ability to take some of the darkest and most jagged truths about fear, regret, sadness, loss, suffering and pain and break them open for her audience to experience in ways that are both optimistic and honest makes her one of the most important and promising young filmmakers on the cinematic landscape." -- Filethirteen .com 

"Candler is very much in touch with a particular sort of teenaged sensibility. She knows the difference between sadness and the petulance it is often mistaken for, and she treats her sullen girls and boys with the sort of patience and understanding their parents (and, perhaps, some audience members) can never quite muster." -- Ain't It Cool News 

 

" jumping off bridges is a wonderfully delicate, authentic portrayal of teenagers and their families." -- Cinematical.com

 

"Truly wonderful work" -- Filmmaker Magazine

 

"Sensitively handled and refreshingly naturalistic" -- The Florida Times Union

Subject:	Clarence Edward Hill


I wish to appeal to you on behalf of Clarence Edward Hill, who is due to 
be executed on September 20, 2006.  

Hill was 23 at the time and there is evidence to suggest that Jackson 
masterminded the crime.  There is also evidence to suggest that Hill was 
under the influence of cocaine at the time of the crime. Furthermore, 
evidence and testimony show that Hill was known by his neighbors and 
family to be a caring and nonviolent person and that he had a trouble 
free-history throughout his years in school and in the neighborhood 
where he lived. 

Clearly Hill is not the worst of the worst and therefore the death 
penalty is not appropriate for Clarence Edward Hill.  In view of the 
above mentioned information, I urge you to act quickly to correct this 
situation and spare the life of this human being.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this important and urgent 
matter.

Whatever happened to the "dead beat dad" legislation? 
 
I have been a single mom for 13 years (my daughter is 14) and have been trying for that amount of time to get the government to enforce the court order on my ex-husband to pay his child support- to no avail- AND I HAVE MANY "SINGLE MOM" friends who say they are battling the same demons.
 
 I am inclined to believe that us single moms have been forgotten in this state and in this country. It's really tough out there in today's society to juggle a demanding career and raise a child by ourselves. And it's made no easier by a government that ignores (worse, doesn't even respond) to our repeated cries for enforcement of our child support orders. It's actually easier to come to terms with the fact that you have NO HELP and that NO ONE cares about your fight for your LEGAL RIGHTS, than it is to get something done about it.  ARE WE REALLY THAT INVISIBLE AND THAT UNWORTHY?
 
Won't you, PLEASE, take mercy on us single moms who struggle- and just give us the support we need to help us collect on court orders that say a father should participate in the support of his child(ren)?
 
We complain in this country about how the "unattended children" should have more parental guidance, but it's made impossible for us to feed our children unless we work 2 jobs. Tell me, do you know how to be in two places at once (home and work)?
 
I have records of the countless attempts made over the years to enforce my court order. However, if I can't afford to shell out hundreds of dollars to a private attorney to help me fight this legally, I'm out of luck. Seriously, if I had the money to hire an attorney, why would I be fighting for the measly $343 a month he's supposed to have been sending in the first place ?
 
Please prove me wrong in my thinking that today's politicians mostly show no concern for the little people. I promise that if you get on your soap box and fight for us, you will find admiration, loyalty and support from the "single mom" community- of which there are hundreds of thousands in the US.

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
PLEASE appoint Nat Kidder from Pinellas County for circuit court or county court when there is an opening!  I am  a Republican.  Nat has the experience and great qualifications. He ran a very clean inexpensive campaign!    He is a great family man, has good moral values and ethics and is a brilliant person. He has had the privilege of preparing numerous briefs and appearing before the Second and the Fifth District Courts of Appeal on civil, criminal and family law matters. Martindale-Hubbell, the nation's premier Attorney rating service, has awarded Nat it's highest "AV" rating!
 
PLEASE consider an appointment for Nat Kidder!  Thank you very much!
 
THANKS also for the GREAT years of service that you have provided to all Floridians! 
 
God Bless America and the Republican Party!

Dear Governor Bush,

    Nat is one of the smartest people that I know.  Couple that with his integrity, family values, experience as an attorney, and commitment to serving the public, I see no better candidate available.
    Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.

Dear Governor Bush:

September 15, 2006



Dear Governor Bush:

Hi, my name is Sherry Keyes and I am writing this letter on behalf of my 
cousin Dennis Sochor.  The Holy Spirit touched my heart to get in touch 
with my cousin in April of this year.  During a sermon our pastor was 
giving on reaching out to the oprhans, widows and captives.  During the 
sermon I was prompted by the Holy Spirit to get in touch with my cousin, 
Dennis Sochor who is at Union Correctional Institute in Raiford, FL.  My 
cousin has been on death row since November 1987 for a crime that took 
place in January 1982 in Broward County.  I wrote my cousin in April and 
the letter I received back was the most spirit filled and loving letter I 
had ever received.  This man has so much love to offer and loves the Lord 
so much.  Dennis, sent us visiting papers to fill out, which we did and in 
the middle of April we made our first visit to him.  Ths was the first 
time I had seen my cousin in 36 years and we have been back several times 
since.  We did alot of praying with Dennis and prayed for the 
manifestation of the truth.  After talking with Dennis, and reading his 
transcript, he has been convicted of a crime that he did not commit.  He 
could not afford an attorney nor did her have any family support.  He was 
convicted of murdering a girl in Broward County on New Years Eve.  Dennis 
younger brother Gary Sochor was with Dennis that evening when Patricia 
Gifford came up missing.  The law I'm sure was not given to his brother 
about testifying against his own.  His parents were not contacted until 
the conclusion of the guilt phase trial and was asked to fly from Michigan 
to Florida.  They maybe spent a half hour with counsel and then was asked 
to prepare a statement to present to the jury the next morning.  His 
brother Gary testified against him.  Even in the courtroom it says In God 
We Trust.  How can anyone convict another person when there is no physical 
evidence.  No body was ever recovered and no investigation was pursued 
after a coerced confession.   In the transcript for case 01-0885 it states 
that without his brother, Gary Sochor testimony the State would not have 
obtained a conviction and that Gary had been cornered into making a untrue 
statements throught techniques more usually seen in a third world 
dictatorship, they would not have believed this testimony, and no 
conviction would have resulted.  Gary's testimony regarding the promise of 
immunity by a police officers is equally something that the jury should 
have been made aware of.  The lower court found Gary's testimony to be 
unreliable and not credible.  How can anyone be convicted of a crime with 
no physical evidence and why has not Dennis Sochor been DNA tested.  What 
I need to do is to get an audience together with the Gov. Jeb Bush so the 
truth can be revealed and he can be set free.  We are only asking the 
courts to reopen this case, Dennis deserve's a fair trial.  We do not have 
the financial means and we are seeking to prove Dennis innocence.  Please 
let me know what I need to do and where to start and thanking you with all 
of my heart for helping my cousin.

It is really important to learn about Hispanic heritage for many different reasons. My opinion why it is important to learn about different cultures and languages are because we are living in the same world and were are not all the same, we have different believes and different religions and it’s really important to know about others and all of the different people that share this world with us. We have to know what’s right and what’s wrong and why not everyone is the same. We all eat different foods, we do different things at home and we all have different ways of doing things. Also it’s really helpful for the future, you never know if one day you have to travel around the world and all those things you learned about Hispanic heritage may come in handy. Many other reasons are because, this country that we live in (United States of America) is a free country that opens doors to everyone of other places and believes and heritages, and by learning about Hispanic heritage it is a way to connect/communicate with other people that come from other places. To become a citizen u also must know about al those things and why people don’t think the same way and why they do not have the same living style. Many of us go to friends houses and we see new things everyday and maybe when we go to one of our friends houses we might see something weird that we are not use to seen everyday, but by learning, and studying about heritages we might know why you see different things everyday and why families aren’t the same. Not only is it important because of those reasons , but by knowing those things not only do we understand each other ,but there is no vandalism and there is world peace.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I would like to encourage your appointment of Victor Silverman to the vacant District 1 School Board seat in Broward County.  I believe it is important to appoint someone who lives within the district, is politically neutral, and promises not to use their temporary position as a catapult for a November election

 

As a parent of school age children and a product of the Broward school system, he will have some insight that the current Board members do not have.  His experience in the military and working within a large team can only add, if only for awhile, to the pool of knowledge that guides the system.

Dear Governor Bush,

      I would like to encourage you to please consider a Republican Hispanic for this position.

 As a Hispanic mother with 2 sons graduated from Broward Public School, I saw the lack of education there is about the culture, and the lack of parental engagement, some due to  lack of friendly atmosphere within the schools . 

As a mother of children with developmental disabilities and ADHD, I have worked very hard advocating for these children as well.

As you may know the percentage of Hispanic population is growing in this County ,but there is no voice to represent them at the Broward School Board level .

Furthermore, with the new elected Board member taking office in November, we will have a Union Board that will work very hard against the A+ Plan and the accountability attached to it.

I do hope that you considered a Hispanic so he/ she can work to bring issues and needs of Hispanics to the front burner.

(I apologize if you are continually inundated with mail from people who are not your constituents, to which I am adding my letter, but please still review it.)

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to ask you to commute the death sentence of Clarence Edward Hill, on the grounds that he was a functioning member of society who worked to help support his family until shortly before the murder, indicating he is not a hardened criminal nor the worst of the worst, and furthermore to execute him will only communicate to society that violence is an acceptable means to deal with your problems.  It is precisely this way of thinking that leads to many of these violent crimes in the first place.

On this point, a study conducted for the United Nations found: "Recent crime figures from abolitionist countries fail to show that abolition has harmful effects. In Canada, the homicide rate per 100,000 population fell from a peak of 3.09 in 1975, the year before the abolition of the death penalty for murder, to 2.41 in 1980, and since then it has declined further. In 2002, 26 years after abolition, the homicide rate was 1.85 per 100,000 population, 40 per cent lower than in 1975." (Hood, Oxford University Press, 2002)

I do not condone the actions of Clarence Hill, they were abhorrent and he deserves punishment, but he was a contributing member of society with a caring and nonviolent history, and to execute him will only propagate the very attitude that leads to many violent crimes in the first place.  Please commute the death sentence of Clarence Edward Hill.  Thank you.

Several months ago I sent you a request asking that you to consider giving me a

The state attorney office advise me that due to Florida statues, my record could

80's. I am  very interesting in becoming a real estate sales associate, I was

GOVERNOR JEB BUSH and THE BOARD EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY:

RE: RONALD NEIL THOMPSON      DC#068736
		
Over the years beginning, 2004, I have written many, many letters on my brother, Ronald Neil Thompson’s behalf for justice.  From The President to The Governor; as well as many others in-between, Judges, Attorney's, Senators, The Sheriff, The Mayor, Dr. Phil, Oprah, just to name a few. I felt that people generally did not care, until I received responses (2005) from The President, The Governor, Senator Stephen Wise and wife of The Jaguars (football) owner, Delores Weaver. 		
We recently submitted to the office of Mrs. Janet Keels (I never met her, but she is a wonderful person, she bought some joy inside my tears) a Waiver Request with all the required paperwork, plus supporting legal documents that our brother, Reginald Thompson the alleged victim in the case has been on a mission to get Ronald locked up since, 2001 (case #01-2067 DV.   Ronald has appeared before several Judges, 2001-2005 in an attempt to get an injunction for protection from Reginald, as well as myself and other family members).  For unknown reason the waiver for clemency was denied, August 2006.  I find it hard to understand how and why after reading all the information that I provided in this case, anyone not to see the unjust and not feel compelled to grant Ronald, clemency, modification or a suspended sentence. I guess it is easier for me, because he's my brother and I love him.  Most importantly I was with Ronald when our brother, Reginald Thompson, the alleged victim had him arrested.

If I had to pull at least two compelling statement from the information I provided in the Waiver/Clemency packet, it would be the following:
1. THE PETITION FILED IN RONALD'S CASE, #05-594 CF, STATES "Ronald Neil Thompson on July 8, 2005, in the County of Nassau and the State of Florida, did own or have in his care custody, possession or control a firearm, to wit; a pistol, having been convicted of a felony in the courts of the State of Florida, to-wit; Escape, in Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County Florida, May 12, 1998 contrary to the provisions of Section 790.23 Florida Statue." 
    A.   THEY FOUND NO GUN ON RONALD, NOR IN HIS CAR (which they still have). Ronald was in their custody appropriately 18 hours before I bonded him out and they found no gun-powered residue on him.
    B.   RONALD'S RECORD WILL SHOW THAT HE HAS NEVER ESCAPED FROM ANYWHERE. BECAUSE OF THIS ERROR, RONALD WAS SENTENCED ACCORDINGLY.  PERHAPS IF THEY HAD FILED THE PETITION WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION, THEY MAY HAVE OFFERED RONALD PROBATION OR A LESSER SENTENCE. If one would do a name search on the Department of Correction, web site, they will find, three (3) Ronald Thompson's. The Ronald Thompson DOC #069189 is William J. Thompson (AKA Ronald Thompson).  William Thompson’s record clearly shows that he is the one that had been charged with escaping in Hillsborough County.  My brother, Ronald Thompson has never escaped from nowhere, which his record clearly shows. (as stated in the packets, Ronald was advised by his Public Defender, Brian Morrissey that if he did not accept the 5-years in and 5-year probation, the Prosecutor, Doc Burgess offered, Mr. Burgess would file a petition as a habitual offender and Ronald could receive a mandatory sentence of 20-years).

SECONDLY: Ronald was arrested three (3) times within a three week period in the same case, with the very same information, the Sheriff's Department had from day one. Ronald was given three (3) different bonds by the same judge. I have always been told that this was a violation of his rights (habeas Corpus).  Our brother, the alleged victim, Reginald Thompson repeatedly went to the Prosecutor (Doc Burgess).  Seven-days after the first arrest, the Officer stated, “Your brother said you had a gun and your brother is not going to lie on you”.  Reginald reported that he asked, Mr. Burgess “Why y’all keep setting a low bond on a convicted felon?  Y’all arrested a white man for shooting a gun in the air and gave him a bond $150,000… I know I’m a black man, but my life is valuable too, I told y’all he tried to kill me”.  Ronald’s Public Defender is aware that the alleged witness, Thomas Blue, (retired school principle, minister) accepted money in this case.  Included in the Clemency packet, I provided legal documentations of how Reginald has been on a mission to get Ronald locked up, since 2001. It all started when Ronald got our mother, Delores Thompson, who suffered with Alzheimer’s out of a nursing home and took on the responsibility of her care.  Doing things I couldn’t, changing her, bathing her etc, plus working 40 plus hours, 3rd shift at Southeastern Metal, never missed a day.  Ronald has appeared before several Judges, 2001-2005 in an attempt to get an Injunction for Protection form Reginald, Case #01-2067 DV.   This is how my writing campaign started to Judges, Chief Judge, Sheriff’ the Mayor, The State Attorney (included Incident numbers from police reports, who always referred us to state attorney) begging for help to end Reginald’s violent attacks and prevent a tragedy.  Case #04-2920 DV, our mother’s caretaker, after several attempts, was finally granted an injunction/protection after Reginald pulled a gun on her and her two daughters; and followed them to school.  Case #04-14616 CC, Reginald attempted to evict our mother and everyone in the house.  He wanted our mother placed back in the nursing home, so that he could rent her house out for $800.00 a month.  I am a Juvenile Probation Officer with the Department of Juvenile Justice and have been for 27-dedicated years, since graduating from the University Of Florida.  Part of my responsibility is to perform Court Liaison duties on Weekends and Holidays.  One Sunday, I was in Court with the Honorable Judge Emmett Ferguson and felt lead to talk with him about my family situation.  That very next morning Ronald called me at work.  The Sheriff’s Officer gave him 15 minutes to get out of the house, including our bedridden mother.  I was able to pick up the telephone, 10:15 AM and talk with Judge Ferguson.  The Judge was able to intervene, pending a hearing with the judge that signed the eviction (divine intervention).  Of course, what Reginald did was not legal and therefore no one had to leave.  

Also included in the Clemency package, forwarded to Mrs. Keels, arrest reports showing that Reginald has turned his violence towards our brother Larry Thompson.  Going to Larry’s resident beating him with a hammer, head, back and chest and tried to run Larry over with his car.  Larry’s injunction/protection from Reginald was denied (case #06-979 DV).  On April 21, 2006, I was finally granted an Injunction for Protection from Reginald in my Case #04-3952 DV.  I’ve had to move in with Larry to protect him from Reginald, since I’ve been granted an injunction and Larry was not; just like Ronald???

There has been so much going on and I’ve tried to make this as short and detailed as possible.  However, all documents supporting the above statements have been submitted to Mrs. Keels.    
 The waiver of the Rules states "a waiver may only be granted by the Governor with the approval of at least one member of the Clemency Board". 

Governor Jeb Bush, Sir, before you leave office, would you please give justice to my brother Ronald Thompson.  I was with Ronald when this situation occurred and knows he is innocent and does not deserve to be incarcerated for a crime he did not commit.  In fact there were 4 of us with Ronald and they can meet with you as well. 
	Enclosing, I am available at any time that you may have so that we can meet if need be.  I can be contacted at (904) 757-1405 home; (904) 798-4707 work.  I am truly looking to hearing from you.  Thank you for your consideration to this matter.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I would like to encourage your appointment of Victor Silverman to the vacant District 1 School Board seat in Broward County.  I believe it is important to appoint someone who lives within the district, is politically neutral, and promises not to use their temporary position as a catapult for a November election

 

As a parent of school age children and a product of the Broward school system, he will have some insight that the current Board members do not have.  His experience in the military and working within a large team can only add, if only for awhile, to the pool of knowledge that guides the system.

Gov,

If you are going to appoint a person to fill the District 1 Broward County School Board vacancy until the November election I would respectfully suggest you consider Darlene Vlazny, who according to the local morning paper submitted her name for your review.

I have served on the Broward County School Board and am familiar with Ms. Vlazny.  She is competent, caring, knowledgeable and has a huge amount of common sense (something that dissipates as school board members get mired in obscure irrelevant issues and lose sight of the fact that they are there for the business of running schools for the benefit of children).

If appointed by you I am sure she will be a positive reflection on both you and the education platform you have promoted during your tenure.

Very truly yours,

Dear Governor Bush;

 

RE:  Appointment of Broward School Board and Rescind Executive Order 06-211

 

I respectfully request that Governor Bush rescind Executive Order number 06-211 and appoint a qualified Republican to fill the Broward School Board District 1 position until the next general election shall be held in September, 2008.  I base this request upon the facts of this case and the Florida statutes pertaining to filling vacancy.

 

It appears that the Governor’s Executive Order was based on misinformation provided in Carole Andrews’ letter dated, September 12, 2006 which lead to a misinterpretation of the situation and a conclusion that a special election would be required immediately upon the heels of his appointment of a replacement.

 

Due to the actual fact that Carole Andrews won reelection on September 5, 2006, no Special Election is needed.  After the Governor appoints a replacement, that person will serve until the next General Election which will be September, 2008.  

 

The Governor’s Executive Order was based upon misinformation provided by Carole Andrews in her letter of resignation dated, September 12, 2006. (See the attached letter and note, the date appears to have been altered as the number “12” is handwritten, not typed.) In the letter, Andrews said, “Likewise my health prohibits me from continuing as a candidate for reelection to the School Board of Broward County at the November 2006 general election.  Accordingly, I regrettably must withdraw as a candidate for reelection as well, in order to permit the voters of Broward County to have the ability to choose my successor from a full range of qualified candidates.” 

 

The letter gives misinformation because Carole Andrews was reelected on September 5, 2006, therefore she was no longer a “candidate for reelection” and she was not required to have a runoff or any participation in the November 2006 general election.  Therefore she can not “withdraw as a candidate for reelection.”  She won reelection and has now announced in the letter that she is retiring immediately for health reasons. 

 

Another possible issue is that her letter is of “retirement” not resignation and her retirement could reasonably be required to begin upon the completion of her current term, November, 2006.  Carole Andrews has been absent from many School Board meetings for a long time so her absence for another School Board meeting, if she chooses not to attend until her “retirement” date arrives would not be an undue hardship on her or the citizens.  It does not appear that her “retirement” would need to be effective immediately.  

 

Because she was reelected for a four year term (more than 28 months) on September 5, 2006, her “retirement”/resignation is to be filled by an appointment of the Governor as per

FL Statute 100.111 (1) (a) If any vacancy occurs in any office which is required to be filled pursuant to S. 1(f), Art. IV of the State Constitution and the remainder of the term of such office is 28 months or longer, then at the next general election a person shall be elected to fill the unexpired portion of such term, commencing on the first Tuesday after the first Monday following such general election.

 

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.  The immediate rescinding of the mistaken Executive Order and correction of this misunderstanding will provide for an orderly transition, giving the Governor the opportunity to appoint a qualified person who can serve for two years before standing for election.

 

The Broward County School Board has nine members and although it is a non-partisan elected position, all nine are Democrats.  Broward County has one of the largest populations of Republicans in Florida and it would be greatly appreciated by Broward’s Republicans if Governor Bush took this opportunity to appoint a qualified Republican to this position.

 

I hope Carole Andrews’ retirement letter was not a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts, but now that the actual facts are known please rescind your order, correct the mistake and appoint a qualified Republican for the Broward School Board vacancy.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

 

Margaret Hostetter

Subject: Soil and Water Conservation Districts
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
In 2004, I was encouraged to seek an elected position on the Dixie 
Soil and Water Conservation Board.  Which I did and entered office unopposed.  As you know these boards were created during the depression era to solved major conservation challenges the Oklahoma dust bowl and other resource challenges existing at that time.  I will be leaving my post this December.  The remaining board members will have to appoint someone to fill my vacancy because no one else was interested in running for the position.
 
I am leaving this position because I believe the Districts no longer are of benefit to the public.  Environmental concerns they were created to correct have been implemented, and agencies such as the Water Management Districts and the Department of Environmental Protection are doing what needs to be done.
 
I would encourage you and the legislature to sunset these districts as they are just a layer of government that really have neither resources nor authority.  The District’s advisory role with NRCS and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs has been dominated by a single member’s operation who is no friend to your party.  Before I joined the board a local cattleman had requested assistance only to be denied because he could show no record of water use for 2 of the 5 previous years.  This cattleman had been in the business all of his adult life.  While a fellow District member had received assistance on several center pivot systems.
 
In just the past month I watched a position get filled for a technician to be based in Gilchrist county where a qualified applicant did not even get an interview.
 
It isn’t violations of the Sunshine law because the collusion seems to be between individual members and State and Federal chiefs. 
 
In closing I have just become disappointed with the system, and I believe my life is too short and my time too valuable to continue this association.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Raymond H. Hodges, Jr.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Please allow Mr. Clarence Hill's lawyers to chance to follow through with his appeals regarding the method used in his execution.
 
Mr. Hill has become a changed individual and  has tried to find peace and forgiveness within religion.  He can be kept in prison for life and be of no harm to the people in the State of Florida.  Please grant him the right to live behind bars but to live and to try to make as meaningful a life as his God will allow.  You do have the right to do this for him; the Supreme Court has given you the right to do this.  I believe all the people in Florida would understand that the Supreme Court has more power than a time limit question.
 
Would you please allow him to live?  All religions have issued a statement against the death penalty-we do not have the right to take his life.
 
Thank you, sir.

September 14, 2006

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was very sad to hear about Carole Andrews' resignation from the Broward County School Board.  I understand that you will be appointing her successor to serve in an interim capacity until a new election can be held.

I would like to express my interest in being considered for this appointment.  Although I have not had the opportunity to meet you in person, I believe that you have met my in-laws--George and Helen Weaver on a number of occasions.  I live in Davie, Florida, and have been married 25 years to my husband, Jefferson, who works as a real estate attorney.  I have 5 children--3 boys and 2 girls, whose ages range from 23 to 5 years of age.  They have all come through the Nova schools in Davie, Florida.

I am a long-time supporter of the Republican Party and I have worked in the Broward County PTA for the last 17 years.  Our school, Nova Blanche Forman, has a student enrollment of almost 900 children.  I have served as PTA President, Vice President, Advisory Chair and Mentor.  I am on the I-Zone Committee, SAC and SAF and have served on numerous other education-oriented committees  through the years.  I have supported and worked with Broward County Council Presidents Kathy Rayson and Elinor Adler in their recent endeavors to support the children in the Broward County schools.

I have attended Legislative Conferences for PTA in Tallahassee but regret that I was not able to meet with you during those conventions.  You may also recall that I invited you to attend our 40-year Celebration at Nova Blanche Forman but your schedule did not permit you to attend.  However, I greatly appreciate the gracious letter of support you sent to our school regarding our anniversary.

I am motivated to seek the school board position for a number of reasons.  I am concerned that the Broward County School System must address the concerns of so many different constituencies that it sometimes forgets that the children attending the schools are our most important consideration.  We need to be the advocate of our childrens' interests 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  I also want to make sure that tax dollars are allocated equitably and fairly so that no student is left behind.  I am also struck as to how huge differences in the physical plants of schools that are located only a few miles apart from each other can exist; I worry that we are not using our scarce resources in the most efficient and effective ways possible.  We have problems in the schools in 2006 that were virtually unheard of even 20 years ago and the schools, like it or not, have become the surrogate parents of many of our children.  This unprecedented situation has made remedying the shortcomings of the educational system all the more pressing.

I do not want to overstate the difficulties facing the Broward County School System.  There are many talented and dedicated people who work within the system and I believe that we can effect great changes if we can work together and focus on improving our schools even more.  In closing, I believe that I can bring energy, integrity, enthusiasm and creativity to the Broward County School Board and would greatly appreciate any consideration you might give.

Should you need any additional information, I can be contacted at 954-551-8986.  Thank you for your time.


Sincerely,


Shelley Weaver

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you to ask you to stay the scheduled September 20th execution of Clarence Hill. It has been statistically proven that executions sanctioned by the state do not help the victim's family recover from their loss, nor do they deter other capital crimes from occurring. Our society is morally diminished by executions, and children are exposed to violence perpetrated by adults they should be modeling. Capital punishment makes no sense if its motivation is a reduction of violence. Prison terms with no hope of release are an alternative to capital punishment for the most violent among us. I leave you with one question:

"Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?"

Mr. Jeb Bush,

Recently I have taken over a ministry in my church. I think it would be some interest to you , it is mission trips to Guatemala. We have been down there a couple of times and we are trying to schedule more trips. While down there we work with orphanages, families, and the government officials. We have built homes, a church named Caminos, set up a computer room in a small town (Pasdores), and many other things. What I am writing about is that as my first fundraiser I am scheduling a bike run and bike show on November 4, at my church. It would be great if you could show up, but if you can not it would be awesome for you to support us. By support I mean with maybe autographed pictures and stuff for a silent auction. I know you have visited Guatemala and you have seen that the country needs lots of help. Our next trip is scheduled in December, it will consist of us evangelizing with the people and building water purification systems for homes. We were told that we could build @ 40 in a week. The cost of the trip and products are not cheap and that is why we do the fundraisers. If you and your family,  or anybody else you might think of might be interested you can contact me at lwlasiuk@tampabay.rr.com. The name of my church is Pathways Community Church. It is located in Clearwater, Fl. Thank you for your time and God Bless You.

I voted for your father twice, and you at least twice, and admire both of you.  However, I don't like the death penalty as it exists in Florida, and especially as it seems to relate to Clarence Hill.  He was strapped to a gurney, had needles injected in his arms in preparation  for execution, i.e. his deatg, and waited there for hours, unable to move.  How much punishment do we, or you, want to inflict on one person.  For that matter, what will his death accomplish, beyond what he has already suffered,
 
Please cancel this execution, and cause his sentence to be commuted to life.

You might not remember the name but you remember the story of the Gainesville officer who dropped dead while training for a Tallahassee marthron.  He would have been one of your body guards.  This is his memorial event.  We would be honored if you join us. We are expecting officers from all over the state to join us early Saturday morning, October 21, 2006.

Dear Gov. Bush -
 
PLEASE appoint Nat Kidder from Pinellas County for circuit court or county court when there is an opening!  I am  a Republican who is very involved with politics. I belong to the Belleair Republican Women's Club, the Gulf Beach Republican Women's Federated, and am a member of the PCREC. Our Susan Bedinghaus beat Nat.  You and I both know that Susan had the name recognition, but Nat had the experience and great qualifications. He ran a very clean inexpensive campaign! With five children he couldn't waste any money! He is a great family man, has good moral values and ethics, and is a brilliant person. He has had the privilege of preparing numerous briefs and appearing before the Second and the Fifth District Courts of Appeal on civil, criminal and family law matters. Martindale-Hubbell , the nation's premier Attorney rating service, has awarded Nat it's highest "AV" rating!
 
PLEASE consider an appointment for Nat Kidder!  Thank you very much!
 
THANKS also for the GREAT years of service that you have provided to all Floridians!

Dear Governor Bush:

    Please do not go forward with Clarence Hill's execution on September
20th. No matter one's position on capital punishment, this is not the time
to execute Mr. Hill.  The courts have not spoken definitively on the
question of lethal injections. To proceed with Mr. Hill's killing under
these circumstances would seem overly aggressive if not perverse.  We do not
believe that is your intention. But, it would appear to be so if you allow
this execution to take place in such a climate.

    Thank you for considering the matters raised in this letter to you.

                                    Respectfully,

 Dear Governor Bush,

            There is no reason to execute Clarence Hill right now.

            There are three good reasons not to.

1.     The U.S. Supreme Court has declared that our method of execution may indeed be forbidden under the Constitution as cruel and unusual punishment.

2.     Our method of execution, a combination of chemicals prohibited for euthanizing animals, may indeed be inordinately painful.

3.     The death watch is an expensive process which is unlikely to result in an actual execution.

 

What’s the rush? There’s always another opportunity for death, but life comes only once.

Hi Scott,

 

On behalf of my executive director Carolyn A. Dekle and our Council, it is my pleasure to forward to you information related to the proposed Florida “Mega-Region” and the national mega-region effort. 

 

As I mentioned in my phone message, our understanding from Peggy Tadej of NARC is that the Governor will be interviewed for the NARC/EDA Telecast that will be broadcast in October.   Please find below, and attached, information related to the proposed Florida Mega-Region, which we currently refer to as the “South-Central Florida Mega-Region,” and the national mega-region effort.  

 

Peggy’s email message, which I have amended slightly to reflect recent changes in the South Florida line up of interviews and remove references to two mega-regions (our understanding is that we are talking about one 32-county mega-region at this time), includes general information about the telecast as well as Peggy’s contact info.  I hope that this information will be helpful to you and Governor Bush.

**************************

 

The effort to promote the concept of “mega-regions” is being spearheaded by the Regional Plan Association of New York, in partnership with the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and Southern California Association of Governments, under the auspices of America 2050 (www.america2050.org).   The academic literature describes mega-regions as “an extended network of metropolitan centers and surrounding areas, often crossing county and state lines, linked by transportation and communication networks, as well as by geographic, environmental, economic, and social factors.”  The key points of the initiative as described in an America 2050 briefing paper are as follows: 

 

*     New forecasts of population growth in the United States predict a 40 percent increase over current levels, to reach a total population of 430 million by the year 2050.

 

*     This new growth will be concentrated in ten or more emerging “mega-regions” – large, connected networks of metropolitan areas.  Mega-regions are projected to absorb 70% of the population growth and 80% of the economic growth that the United States will experience between now and 2050. 

 

*     These mega-regions, which are defined by environmental, cultural, infrastructure and functional characteristics, will experience five key demographic and spatial challenges as they continue to take shape in the coming decades.

o       Rapid population growth

o       Build-out of metropolitan areas

o       Uneven and inequitable growth patterns within and between regions

o       Stressed ecosystems (“eco-structure”)

o       Aging infrastructure facilities

 

*     The “mega-region” concept provides a spatial framework for organizing planning investments and policies in the United States to address these future challenges such as “future federal surface transportation bills, the reorganization of Amtrak, protecting major ecosystems and watersheds from unrestrained development, connecting bypassed cities and regions to sources of growth, and preparing infrastructure and disaster response systems.”   

 

*     Similar networks of metropolitan areas in Asia and Europe are being seen as the new competitive units in the global economy, and major public and private investments are being made in those areas in high-speed rail, broadband communication, goods movement systems and other infrastructure to strengthen transportation and economic connections between their component cities.

 

*     Without similar investments, mega-regions in America will face common problems associated with the rapid influx of population and fail to capitalize on their potential for economic growth.

 

*     A new initiative called “America 2050: Towards a National Strategy for Prosperity, Equity and Sustainability” has been launched to address America’s anticipated growth before the year 2050 and the challenges and opportunities associated with the emergence of mega-regions.

 

Studies and published reports have been done to define the following mega-regions:  the Northeast, Piedmont Atlantic, Arizona Sun Corridor, Southern California and Cascadia Ecopolis.  However, a formal study of the South-Central Florida Mega-Region has not been initiated. 

 

On September 21st the South Florida Regional Planning Council is hosting a policy discussion with a small group of national and regional experts and academics.  Guests at this initial policy roundtable will discuss the national mega-region effort and the proposed South-Central Florida Mega-Region including boundaries; whether or not this construct makes sense for south-central Florida; identification of key influences affecting the mega-region; and next steps, including whether or not to initiate a formal study of the South-Central Florida Mega-Region. 

 

It is expected that similar policy discussions may be hosted in different areas of the South-Central Florida Mega-Region in the months to come.

Importance:	High

Dear Jeb:

I'm quite sure by now you are aware of School Board Member, Carol Andrew's retiring due health reasons. Governor, I am sadden by her illness and pray that she is able to overcome her battle with this horrific disease. We continue to pray for her and her family during this dreadful time.

Jeb, as you probably know, I campaigned for the same District #1 Seat in 1998, the same year you were elected as Governor of Florida. That year, Judy Budnik and I ran in the first  "Non-Partisan" school board race, I wasn't as successful as Judy Budnik, but I worked just as hard in attempting to overcome a sea of  "D" voters within District #1.

Governor, should you take the opportunity to make an appointment  to the now vacant  School Board District #1 seat, my request is that you would consider me.  I feel that I am greatly qualified to move into that leadership position. I have serve as one of your appointee's to the South Broward Hospital District since your election to the Governor's Mansion. Certainly, I would like to continue that service to you and the next Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, as a District #1 School Board Member.

You know, my heart has always been committed to children and education,  I have dedicated (39) years to the school board in educating children right here in the same district that Mrs. Andrews' served so well.

Jeb, it would be one of my heart's desire to further serve this district and the Broward County School Board as District #1 representative. I am aware that there will be many requests like this, but all I'm asking is that you as well as others consider what I have done as a long time dedicated educator, an elected city official and my tenure of service in District #1, as a hospital commissioner.

Thanking you in advance for the attention and most of all your consideration regarding this very important matter.

Hello again,

I am in the process of making my plans for next week and need to know  
if my presence is expected at the clemency hearing on Thursday.  In  
order to show sensitivity to David Codgen's mother, I will be the  
only person giving testimony on behalf of Taylor Wells. There will be  
no family or friends  present in Tallahassee.  I am recommending   
that at whatever time Taylor is released he should live outside  
Brevard County to show respect for Mrs. Codgen and other family and  
friends who may still feel he should serve his mandatory sentence. I  
have agreed to assume the role of lifetime mentor for as long as that  
is in Taylor Wells' best interest.

I did receive the letter of support for commutation from Agent Tod  
Goodyear, Case Agent for the David Codgen homicide.  However, I am  
not forwarding it to you as I previously planned because Agent  
Goodyear goes over the history of the case, the fact that more  
culpable co-defendants are out of jail, etc. and that is not where I  
want to focus this case.  I am affirming that the system worked in  
its conviction of Mr. Wells under the felony murder rule, and that it  
doesn't matter who does or doesn't remain in prison, who was youngest  
and least culpable,etc.
This process is about admission of guilt, expression of remorse,  
plans for restitution, and pleas for mercy and forgiveness.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject:	Please investigate political matter now

The Hon. Jeb Bush, Governor of the State of Florida:

There is a need for Appointment of Special Prosecutor To Investigate 
and
empanel grand jury regarding Improper Use of Official Positions and
Unlawful Use of Taxpayer Funds to Influence Judicial Election and
Outcome of Terri Schindler Schiavo Case
 
   On or about July 2, 2004, a political commercial promoting the
reelection of George W. Greer to the office of Sixth Judicial Circuit
Court Judge, Group 18, was filmed on government property, a courtroom 
in
the Pinellas County Courthouse. Participating in the political activity
on governmental property in uniform, allegedly while on duty, was
William Cunningham, a deputy with the Pinellas County Sheriff's
Department.  Deputy Cunningham engaged in the political activity with
the full knowledge and consent (and perhaps order)  of Sheriff Everett
Rice, according to Marianne Pasha, PCSO public information officer, and
according to payroll records, was paid with taxpayer funds for doing
so.  Deputy Cunningham appeared in the political with a
government-owned vehicle, a Pinellas County Sheriff's Department patrol
car. 
   Also appearing in the political ad with their names and positions
identified in writing on the screen were James Hellickson, assistant
prosecutor in the office of Sixth Circuit state attorney Bernie McCabe
and Paula Shea, assistant in the office of Sixth Circuit public 
defender
Bob Dillinger, allegedly unlawfully using the influence of their titles
and positions to attempt to influence a judicial election.
   Also appearing in the political advertisement, allegedly
improperly, were court officers and employees of the Sixth Circuit,
names unknown.
   Public officers Everett Rice, Bernie McCabe and Bob Dillinger in
addition to William Cunningham, James Hellickson and Paula Shea
knowingly, willfully and intentionally used the influence and power of
their offices and positions and in the case of at least William
Cunningham, with the use of taxpayer funds, to attempt to influence the
outcome of a judicial election, in essence controlling a judgeship and
controlling the outcome of the Terri Schindler Schiavo case at a time
when Sheriff Rice and Prosecutor McCabe had steadfastly refused to
perform the duties of their respective offices to investigate matters 
of
alleged criminal wrongdoing in the Schiavo case.
 
   Under Article IV, Section 1(a) Florida Constitution, the governor
is vested with "supreme executive power".  Further, the Governor
"shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed" and commissions
"all officers of the state and counties".
   Under the general law of the state, the governor may, by
executive order filed with the Department of State, assign state
attorneys "one of more specified investigations, cases or matters.
Specifically, Section 27.14(1) Florida Statutes provides if any state
attorney is disqualified to represent the state in any investigation,
case or matter pending in the courts of his or her circuit or if, for
any other good and sufficient reason, the Governor determines that the
ends of justice would be best served, the Governor may, by executive
order filed with the Department of State, either order an exchange of
circuits or of courts between such state attorney and any other state
attorney or order an assignment of any state attorney to discharge the
duties of the state attorney with respect to one or more specified
investigations, cases or matters specified in general in the executive
order of the Governor.
   In this case, it is mandatory that a special prosecutor be
assigned to investigate this matter as Mr. McCabe, state attorney for
the Sixth Circuit, is directly and personally involved in the matter 
and
would be a subject of the investigation as well as an employee of his
office, therefore Mr. McCabe has a prohibited conflict of interest and
must be disqualified.
   As Governor, you frequently issue executive orders appointing
another state attorney to investigate and prosecute cases free from the
taint of appearance of conflict of interest or impropriety.
   Good and sufficient reason exists for the Governor to determine
that the ends of justice would be best served by assigning another 
state

Hell Governor Bush -  I am a third year elementary school teacher. I love what I do and I have worked hard to get in to the classroom as a professional teacher, and I sincerely enjoy it.  I teach fourth grade at a Title 1 school that is currently in corrective action and spend a lot of my day preparing my students for FCAT.  I truly work to leave no child left behind.  I want my students  to love school, be successful at it and contribute to Florida as viable, happy adults.  I would like to invite you to come and spend the day with me and my students in my classroom.  All parties would benefit as my students could feel important having the Governor visit them, I could get your input on education and what else can be done, and ultimately you can see what a day of school is like as you transition as Florida's current Governor into the future endeavors you pursue.  Education is the key for us all.  One third of my students are considered ESOL - speakers of other languages (all Spanish in this case) - and how wonderful for them to meet a powerful person (you!) who is also bilingual - what an inspiration to all my students.  Please consider my invitation of spending a day in the classroom with fourth graders at a newly remodeled Title I school.

Governor Bush,
 
Greetings! My name is Jacob Brennan, and I am a political science graduate student at the University of West Florida here in Pensacola. I am also the president of Pi Sigma Alpha, the National Political Science Honors Society. I am writing in regards for a possible speaking opportunity for you here at the university. We (Pi Sigma Alpha) are inviting you to come speak to the university community on civics and government. Our main focus is on increasing awareness of politics across the campus community, and we believe that you could help us reach that goal by presenting a speech on civics (your choice: voting, being "politically aware", or the state of politics in Florida). We figure you to be the most knowledgeable and familiar with Florida government, as you are the present governor, and it would be our honor to have you speak on campus. We are looking at having this event either some time later this semester or next Spring, and we would be more than willing to work around your schedule. We know you are busy and that this is a long shot, but do you believe it to be feasible with your schedule for the next few months? Thank you so much for your time, and we look forward to hearing your reply. 
 
All the best,

Dear Governor Bush:

I have emailed you many times concerning the welfare of Florida's children, something that is dear to your heart, but today I'm emailing you about our school East Milton Elementary.  Our school consists of some of the poorest children in Santa Rosa County but it is a school that goes that "extra mile" in the teaching of these children.  The administration and staff of our school is among the best in the state.  The love and concern for these children is evident from the Principal to the cafeteria staff, the children of East Milton Elementary are valued, they are our future.

My reason for this email, other than to brag about our school, is to invite you to be our guest during National School Lunch Week (October 10th - 13th).  Come and see how well our teachers are implementing your educational programs, see the genuine love and respect that our students have for their teachers.  See the success and pride in the eyes of the East Milton Road Runners.

I know and appreciate how busy you are and the tremendous burden that you carry for all of Florida but if there is anyway you can attend, it would be the highlight in the lives of these children.

Three of these children are my special needs children adopted out of Florida's system, children that were severely abused by their birth parents but dearly treasured by my husband and me.  They are successful due to the love and dedication of their teachers at East Milton Elementary in Milton, Florida.

Subject:	[*] Illegal Immigration

Illegal immigration is a big problem with me.  My ancestors came here legally, except for my Cherokee side who were already here! If you think about the problem as written below, I think a solution is evident.

 

A lady wrote the best letter in the Editorials in ages!! It explains things better than all the baloney you hear on TV.............

 

Let's say I break into your house

 

“Recently large demonstrations have taken place across the country protesting the fact that Congress is finally addressing the issue of illegal immigration. Certain people are angry that the US might protect its own borders, might make it harder to sneak into this country and,

once here, to stay indefinitely. Let me see if I correctly understand the thinking behind these protests.

 

Let's say I break into your house. Let's say that when you discover me in your house, you insist that I leave. But I say, "I've made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors; I've done all the things you don't like to do. I'm hard-working and honest (except for when I broke into your house).

 

According to the protesters, not only must you let me stay, you must add me to your family's insurance plan, educate my kids, and provide other benefits to me and to my family (my husband will do your yard work because he too is hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part). If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my friends who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my right to be there. It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than I do, and I'm just trying to better myself. I'm hard-working and honest, um, except for well, you know.

 

And what a deal it is for me!! I live in your house, contributing only a fraction of the cost of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about it without being accused of selfishness, prejudice and being an anti-housebreaker.

 

Oh yeah, and I want you to learn my language so you can communicate with me.

 

Why can't people see how ridiculous this is?! Only in America....if you agree, pass it on (in English). Share it if you see the value of it as a good smile,

 

If not blow it off along with your future Social Security funds.

Gov. Bush,

I'd like to invite (beg, plead, implore, etc.) you to visit my classroom the next time you are in the Tampa area. Mulrennan is a middle school located between Brandon and Plant City that has had the proud honor of being an "A" school every year we have been open and the development of civic virtue and involvement is at the core of what I teach in my particular curriculum. With the help of our US Senators, I have been able to provide each of my students and most of their parents with a copy of the US Constitution and we spend over a month combing through the Declaration of Independence, Constitution and the Bill of Right. This is done so the students and their parents can see how important it is to be an ACTIVE member of a community, not simply a resident within a community.

I believe that you share many of these same views and I would like to have you as a guest at our school and share your viewpoints on civic virtue and good citizenship the next time your are in the Tampa area.

Thank you for your time and I hope the rest of your tenure is as successful and distinguished as the last 7+ years have been.

Governor Bush:

The County commission meets today at 5:05 p.m. today Originally as a scheduled budget Meeting.
However, the County Attorney's Office wants the commission to approve advertising a notice to adopt changes to the county land-use plan. These changes would add  2 feet to unincorporated Monroe county's 35 foot height restriction for affordable housing  and increase the number of units allowed in the development of affordable housing.

Our newly elected District 5 commissioner Sylvia Murphy will not be sworn in untill November 15.  Glenn Patton,  your appointed commissioner to the recently deceased commissioners seat should not be allowed to vote on these pro-development inspired changes to the county's land-use program.  
This is an end run to by-pass the will of the  Monroe County's Voter's to have some control over the over-developement issues in the Keys before Sylvia Murphy is allowed to take her seat.

I am asking you to Remove interim County Commissioner Glenn Patton now, and install Sylvia Murphy in his seat.  I see no reason why this and other iimportant issues should be voted on by the lame duck commissioner who was soundly defeated by Sylvia Murphy.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to ask if you would be interested in speaking on Wednesday, November 15th, 2006 to a class or classes at Tarpon Fundamental Elementary school for the Great American Teach-in.  As you probably already know, this is a great opportunity for parents and community members to share their career, hobby, or special interest with children.  I think the children would be incredibly interested in learning about the ins and outs of being governor and running for political office.  You could also just come and read a book to a class or share your favorite pastime.  

Tarpon Fundamental Elementary was the highest scoring school in the state for the FCAT.  We pride ourselves in our high parent involvement, motivated students, and gifted teachers.  Having our state governor visit our school to speak would be so rewarding for everyone involved.  

I am the master scheduler for this special day at Tarpon Fundamental Elementary.  There are a variety of time slots available from 8:30 am to 1:40 pm in half hour increments for kindergarten through 5th grade. Again, you can speak to one class or multiple classes.  If you have time in your busy schedule to volunteer a half hour or more for this great cause, we would be most appreciative.  

Please contact me at 937-1514 or you can email me at rgelam@verizon.net with the times you are available, grade preferences, and subject you would like to share.  I would be very happy if you chose to be one of our speakers!  Thank you so much for your time.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Office of the Governor
The Capitol 
PL05 
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

It is my understanding that Nathaniel “Nat” Kidder has been recommended for two circuit judicial positions that are open at this time and that an interview is scheduled on September 13, 2006.  

 

I am requesting you give serious consideration to appointing Mr. Kidder.  Summarily, he 
is a traditional family man with fair and honorable values, and simply a many who knows and loves his work. 

 

A recent St. Petersburg Times quote stated that he is “a highly regarded veteran attorney.”  Other quotes excerpted from the St. Petersburg Times state the following:  “Kidder’s legal colleagues offer nothing but praise for his professionalism, legal talent and temperament.”  "Kidder also has the experience of having been both a prosecutor and defense attorney. He is widely viewed as fair, smart and able."

 

Mr. Kidder has been a lawyer for nineteen years. His practice has ranged from criminal prosecution and defense work to complex civil litigation and family law. Nat has represented clients in both federal and state courts. He has experience in over sixty jury trials and has represented clients before the Second and Fifth District Courts of Appeal. 


Nat is a former United States Marine and has been a resident of Pinellas County for 23 years. He is married and the father of five children.  Nat Kidder has been awarded an "AV" rating by Martindale-Hubbell, the nation’s premier attorney rating service. This rating indicates that Nat's peers have rated his legal ability as "Very High to Preeminent."  He was selected on three separate occasions for judicial office by the Judicial Nominating Commission of the Sixth Judicial Circuit. 

 

Again, please consider Mr. Kidder for a circuit judicial position.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

 

Sincerely,

 

Marlene S. Shaw

Dear Sir,

 

Just wanted to get your opinion and what you are doing to preserve Eglin’s 46th Test Wing. In my opinion the Air Force is pursuing in dismantling and moving the 46th to Edwards AFB. I personally believe the Air Force has made there mind up and is going to take this action with or without the blessing of the people, BRAC or our elected officials. Something needs to be done now in order to save thousands of jobs in northwest Florida and south Alabama. The men and women of the 46th Test Wing have proven and produced the most sophisticated weapon systems in the world and now the Air Force wants to destroy what we have build.  We need your help!

 

 

 

Thank you

I've already written you on the subject of the 46th Test Wing closing and I 
wish I kept your response, I'm sure it was full of promises.  Please answer 
me this, why was General Wilson and Colonel Sanders in my building today at 
Eglin AFB along with the transition team and members from Edwards AFB 
preparing and telling us the move is a "done deal"? It's going to happen and 
we've nothing more from anyone else saying otherwise. Please respond.

 Dear Governor Bush,
 
I want to thank you for the incredible job you have done for Florida and as Commander-in-Chief of the Florida National Guard.  I have the dubious distinction of being the First Sergeant of the first soldier in the Florida Army National Guard to die in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Sergeant First Class Lloyd S. Clements was one of my platoon sergeants.  He was  a hard-working, dedicated to the mission, and completely trustworthy soldier.  He was one of the finest men I have ever met and a devout Christian.  I was among the privileged guests present at the dedication of the Camp Blanding Memorial.  It was a beautiful and fitting ceremony.  Thank you for taking the time to speak and talk to the families of the fallen soldiers.  I know it meant a lot to them.  
 
I had the honor of introducing you to my wife Karon Westmoreland, who started as a volunteer years ago and now is a member of the State Family Readiness Program.  I must admit, Sir, that in your presence I was a bit nervous.  Knowing that your time was limited, I tried to be as brief as possible and spoke out of context.  I told you that I had met your wife, Columba, and she said that I was much bigger than yourself.   When I had met Mrs. Bush, she knowing that I was a soldier, gave me a hug to thank me for my service.  I had to lean over really far to give her a hug and that is when she said that I was so tall that she thought I was even taller than yourself.  The words just came out and sounded wrong.  I do apologize.  I hope you got a chuckle out of it.
 
Once again, thank you for the being my Governor and I will continue to support you in all future endeavors.
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Master Sergeant Todd G. Westmoreland

Hello Mr. Governor Bush,

My name is Samuel Duperval. I am a Criminal Justice
major seeking your need of help. I had my share of
minor crime and I would like to continue my life with
no problems with the law. I am currently a Security
Guard with a G-license. Unfortunately for me, due to
my past problems with the law, I had a felony that I
have sealed. At a younger age, peer pressure took the
best part of me. I regretted those days. I am now a
hard working man trying to provide for my family. My
goal in life is to become a Police Officer/
Correctional Officer to help stop the crime. I
understand that Florida has a policy about those with
a felony can not persue certain types of occupation. I
believe in second chances and I think every one
deserve a second chance to prove themselves to the
society. Its been nearly some years since I stayed out
of trouble with the law and I feel that I too deserve
a second chance. Governor Bush, what I am asking of
you is too help me get a pardon to achieve my goals.
Its been a pleasure having you has a Governor and I
hope you continue doing a job well done for us. Thank
you in advance.

Samuel Duperval

Dear Governor Bush,
My husband Dennis teaches Kindergarten at Crown Point Elementary here in Jacksonville. Sharon Burnett knows him well. 
He is an exceptional teacher  who became paralzed with Multiple Sclerosis eighteen years ago, and teaches from a wheelchair. We were informed that he has been selected to represent the United States as Professional Education Delegate with the "People To People" Ambassador Program, traveling to China for one week on Nov. 10th. We need your support and help to raise funds very quickly. He must give the committee a decision by Sept 21. The local community. state and nation would benefit from the lectures he would develop and give. This program is currently being chaired by your brother, President Bush. Dennis would have an opportunity to share his expertise and discuss new approaches and ideas with his counterparts in China! Dennis is well known in our community as not only a great Educator but an inspiration to many! Needless to say, I don't have to tell you how proud I am of him. 
Since I would be traveling to China with him to assist him, we extimate the cost of the program and everything would be $15,000 to $20,000. Can you help us find sponsors for this program? I look forward to hearing from you, and appreciate any help[ you can provide. Thank you and God Bless!

To whom it may concern,

 

I have a child support case in Brevard County and my child will turn 18 years old in 2007.  I have been attempting to research how a father that pays child support goes about ending his obligation once the child is the age of consent.  I am currently Active Duty Air Force and in no way do I want to stop payments the wrong way and have it backlash on me so I plan on ending the payments the correct way.

 

So far all my research has turned up information how to obtain/start or enforce child support payments.  I have not found one useful form or link for a father (the payor) to go about ending support the correct way!  Any information or direction in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Subject:	Comments on Lake O Regulation Schedule

Dear Sir:

I’m a resident of Sanibel Island and have become increasingly concerned about the impact of Lake O releases on our estuary.  The damage being caused by the Lake O releases down the Caloosahatchee are killing our waters, our wildlife, our way of life, and hurting the economy of Southwest Florida, which hurts the overall health of the State economy.  After last summer’s crisis, the communities of Florida affected by the Lake O releases have been vocal and organized in sounding the alarm and getting the attention of policy makers--locally, state-wide, and in Washington--and the media has kept the focus on the problem and its dire consequences.  We really thought that the policy makers “got it”…then suddenly, the draft Lake O regulation schedule comes out and we’re back to square one!  What happened?  How could the Corps ignore the impacts on the estuaries when setting these regulations?  The lessons of Katrina should not be “protect the dike at all costs”.  Don’t hide behind that argument, and create another disaster.  The solution to this problem requires shared sacrifice, it requires using the best & most up-to-date data, and it requires balance and fine-tuning.  The Lake O regulation schedule must not permit releases into the estuaries that exceed biologist’s limits for environmental safety.  The Corps protocol must maintain the Lake at a lower level by having ongoing low-level releases sent in ALL directions—not just down the Caloosahatchee.  There is land owned by the Water Management and by the Corps where excess water can be stored in emergencies and this should be part of your regulation plan, NOW.

 

The Charlotte Harbor is a NATIONAL ESTUARY, part of EPA’s national estuary program that is supposed to afford it extra protections.  There’s a management plan that all parties have agreed to help implement.  Why is one arm of the Federal government destroying a resource recognized by another part of the same Federal government as a treasure to be protected and preserved?  Please change the regulation schedule before you create another disaster that cannot be undone. 

 

I am unable to attend the Corps’ public hearing on September 14th but wanted to add my voice to those attending that important meeting.  Please listen to the participants at that meeting and to the many other residents of Southwest Florida.  We are well informed, we’re passionate, we’re dead serious, and you know we’re right.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am writing to request that you please seat our newly-elected County Commissioner into her seat, which is now filled by an appointment of yours, Glenn Patton, due to the death of the previous commissioner, Murray Nelson.

 

Sylvia Murphy was elected over Glenn Patton by 54% of the voters in the universal primary to fulfill the term of the late commissioner.  As the underdog winner it seems obvious that the voters are ready for a change and I would appreciate having her seated in order to allow her voice to be heard on some very important issues that will be coming before that body in the near future. There are already comprehensive plan changes being rushed through in order for the players to receive favorable votes.  I believe it is time for the voters to have their voices respected.

 

Thank you for your consideration.

 

Sincerely,

 

Sherry Phillips

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, 
 
My name is Kay Thacker, I live in Key Largo, unincorporated Monroe County, my phone and fax number is 305-451-3929. I am secretary of Sexton Cove Property Owners Association, Inc.; I serve as executive board member on the Island of Key Largo Federation of Homeowners Association, Inc.  I am a member of Last Stand, Key West, Florida, I am a member of Big Pine Key Civic Association, Inc. also a member of Florida Keys Citizens Association. I am only speaking for myself. I am a respected citizen and voter in Monroe County
 
I am requesting that you as our Governor remove the appointed Interim County Commissioner Glenn Patton.  We now have an elected official with over 900 votes more than Commissioner Glenn Patton received, so the voters have spoken.  Please appoint our elected Commissioner Sylvia Murphy.
 
There is a special BOCC ( Board of County Commission) meeting in Key Largo on Wednesday September 13, 2006. It is a special meeting for budget, but as I was reading the agenda Item F #1 caught my eye.
 
Monroe County Board of County Commissioners

Agenda- Special Meeting

 
 
F.      COUNTY ATTORNEY

1.      Approval to advertise Notice of Intention to Adopt, and forward notification to DCA, of a Proposed Amendment to the 2010 Comprehensive Plan,~ to provide additional density bonuses and .5 ROGO allocations for affordable housing units between 400 - 750 square feet and 
 
 
*******relaxation of the 35 foot maximum height limitation under certain limited circumstances using the expedited adoption proceeding provided in the Community Workforce Housing Innovation Pilot Program ("CWHIP").
 
Key West was allowed to vote on a similar issue in the September 5, 2006 primary and it was voted down 2 to 1, 35 ft height increase to 37 ft...we are not even being given the chance to vote on our height increase from 35 to 37ft. The over all consensus in Monroe County is NO HEIGHT INCREASE FOR MONROE COUNTY. 
 
Our county officials are setting this ambush up according to our 2010 Comprehensive Plan so that this can be voted on by your appointed Commissioner Glenn Patton and not our elected Commissioner Sylvia Murphy...the voters have spoken and this is one of the reasons I am e-mailing your office.  I will following up with a phone call to your office this morning.  You have already allowed John Dick, elected school board official to take his seat, and you have allowed Mario DiGennaro County Commissioner of district 4 to take his seat, please help expedite fair Government.  I am urging all citizens of unincorporated Monroe County to call or email our Governor on this matter.
 
I AM REQUESTING THAT YOU REMOVE INTERIUM COUNTY COMMISSIONER GLENN PATTON AND ALLOW OUR ELECTED COMMISSIONER SYLVIA MURPHY TO TAKE HER SEAT SO THE VOTERS HAVE A CHANCE TO BE HEARD. THE VOTERS OF MONROE COUNTY HAVE SPOKEN, PLEASE CONSIDER THIS.  
Thank You for your consideration in this matter.

RE: Need for Appointment of Special Prosecutor To Investigate and empanel grand jury regarding Improper Use of Official Positions and Unlawful Use of Taxpayer Funds to Influence Judicial Election and Outcome of Terri Schindler Schiavo Case

 

   On or about July 2, 2004, a political commercial promoting the reelection of George W. Greer to the office of Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge, Group 18, was filmed on government property, a courtroom in the Pinellas County Courthouse. Participating in the political activity on governmental property in uniform, allegedly while on duty, was William Cunningham, a deputy with the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department.  Deputy Cunningham engaged in the political activity with the full knowledge and consent (and perhaps order)  of Sheriff Everett Rice, according to Marianne Pasha, PCSO public information officer, and according to payroll records, was paid with taxpayer funds for doing so.  Deputy Cunningham appeared in the political with a government-owned vehicle, a Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department patrol car.  

   Also appearing in the political ad with their names and positions identified in writing on the screen were James Hellickson, assistant prosecutor in the office of Sixth Circuit state attorney Bernie McCabe and Paula Shea, assistant in the office of Sixth Circuit public defender Bob Dillinger, allegedly unlawfully using the influence of their titles and positions to attempt to influence a judicial election.

   Also appearing in the political advertisement, allegedly improperly, were court officers and employees of the Sixth Circuit, names unknown.

   Public officers Everett Rice, Bernie McCabe and Bob Dillinger in addition to William Cunningham, James Hellickson and Paula Shea knowingly, willfully and intentionally used the influence and power of their offices and positions and in the case of at least William Cunningham, with the use of taxpayer funds, to attempt to influence the outcome of a judicial election, in essence controlling a judgeship and controlling the outcome of the Terri Schindler Schiavo case at a time when Sheriff Rice and Prosecutor McCabe had steadfastly refused to perform the duties of their respective offices to investigate matters of alleged criminal wrongdoing in the Schiavo case.

 

   Under Article IV, Section 1(a) Florida Constitution, the governor is vested with “supreme executive power”.  Further, the Governor “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed” and commissions “all officers of the state and counties”.

   Under the general law of the state, the governor may, by executive order filed with the Department of State, assign state attorneys “one of more specified investigations, cases or matters. Specifically, Section 27.14(1) Florida Statutes provides if any state attorney is disqualified to represent the state in any investigation, case or matter pending in the courts of his or her circuit or if, for any other good and sufficient reason, the Governor determines that the ends of justice would be best served, the Governor may, by executive order filed with the Department of State, either order an exchange of circuits or of courts between such state attorney and any other state attorney or order an assignment of any state attorney to discharge the duties of the state attorney with respect to one or more specified investigations, cases or matters specified in general in the executive order of the Governor.

   In this case, it is mandatory that a special prosecutor be assigned to investigate this matter as Mr. McCabe, state attorney for the Sixth Circuit, is directly and personally involved in the matter and would be a subject of the investigation as well as an employee of his office, therefore Mr. McCabe has a prohibited conflict of interest and must be disqualified.

   As Governor, you frequently issue executive orders appointing another state attorney to investigate and prosecute cases free from the taint of appearance of conflict of interest or impropriety. 

   Good and sufficient reason exists for the Governor to determine that the ends of justice would be best served by assigning another state attorney to investigate the alleged improper use of public office, public funds and government property to influence the outcome of a judicial election and ultimately the outcome of the high profile Schiavo case.

   “A public office is a public trust” Section Article II, §8(a) Florida Constitution. Moreover, “the people shall have the right to secure and sustain that trust against abuse.  

   The issue at hand involves official misconduct in Pinellas County related to the judicial election of George W. Greer during 2004 and in particular, the Primary of Aug. 31, 2004 as it relates to his political commercial aired between Aug. 9, 2004 and Aug. 30, 2004.

   The matter involves some or all of the following acts or omissions:  Abuse of the pubic trust (Art. II, Section 8(a) Florida Constitution, breach of the public trust for private gain and inducing others to breach the public trust for private gain (Art. II, Section 5, Florida Constitution) violations of Florida’s Code of Ethics including but not limited to Section 112.313(2) FS, 112.313(6) and 112.317. 

   The immediate assignment of a special prosecutor to investigate this matter is requested.

 Sincerely,

Dianne Walker

Good afternoon! My name is Corey Warner. I am 11 years old and attend Sanford Middle School in Seminole County. I am doing community service for the school. I am always volunteering at school, so I wanted to do something different. I have decided to give back to my community and help children who are not as fortunate as me. I found a wonderful agency that is the largest and oldest non-profit home for children in Central Florida. I am sure you are familiar with the Children's Home Society. It is a home for abused and abandoned children. I am doing a can food drive at school for them, but it is not enough. They usually do not get help for Thanksgiving and I think that a shame. Thanksgiving is a time to be thankful for your family and the life that you have. Well they have nothing and that is horrible! I am not sure if you can help me, but I need to find business that would be willing to contribute to this home. I have gone to serval stores around Seminole County, but did not have much luck. I was hoping that maybe you new of some special people who would give me some help in making my dream come true. Please remember that we are the future of the world and with your help, we will lead the world on day successfully! I look forward to your response,

Subject:	Important:Letter on behalf of Lorenzo Barajas

  
Dear Governor, Members of the Clemency Board, and whomever it concerns,
 
On September 21, 2006, you all face the difficult task of determining the fate of those who wish to have their civil rights restored and those seeking clemency, a predicament which my father, Lorenzo Barajas faces. My name is Sonia Barajas and I am the proud daughter of Lorenzo Barajas, a human being who was wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime he never committed. I write the following letter because it hurts me to see the situation my father is in. My father is my inspiration. He works vigorously in order to provide for our family. He is viewed in our community as a hard worker and dedicated father. My father would never hurt anybody. His only mission in life seems to be providing for his family, and protecting his family. Many years ago, my half-sister accused my father of molesting her. This whole evil scheme was brewed up by her mother who was filled with envy at the thought of my father being with my mother and not with her. Although proof of this so called molestation was never attained my father was convicted and therefore many years later he still carries the burden of that horrible lie. I know my father is innocent and I have never doubted it for a minute. My father and my mother have been together for the past 19 years. We are a happy family composed of five children. My younger brother is 12 years old and is in the 6th grade and on the honor roll. I also have a brother named Raul who is 15 years old and in the 10th grade. He is viewed by his teachers as a young man with excellent manners whose presence always cheers up the day. My sister Emma is 16 years old and in the 11th grade. I am proud to say that my sister is enrolled in honors classes and also is known to make the honor roll. My brother Antonio is 17 years old and is in the 12th grade, a senior in high school. He will be graduating on May 2007. As I mentioned before, my name is Sonia and I am 18 years old. I graduated from Glades Central High School in Belle Glade, Florida on May 19, 2006. I am a member of the NAACP, and also actively participated while in high school with the International Thespian Society, Future Business Leaders of America, and served as a member in the Criminal Justice program at Glades Central and also I still give back to my community through volunteering. I go above and beyond my responsibilities because my father always taught me to help those who are in need. He has a significant influence on me and because of that I try to push myself to the outermost limits. My father has always taught me to challenge myself. With his help I attained one of my goals which was to be the first child to graduate from high school. My father has four other children from his previous marriage who never graduated and decided to drop out of school. They are still, to this day, feeling the effects of their decision to give up, struggling with their own children and minimum wage jobs. My dad supported me and gave me all the encouragement I needed to keep going even when I felt like giving up. It is because of my father that I feel I have to further pursue my education by attending college. I hope to major in Criminal Justice or Political Science. Since my father was declared a sexual offender, it is very hard for him to get a good paying job. We are quite a large family and working in the sugar cane is just not cutting it. My father is capable of achieving so much more, but due to him being labeled, he is not offered the opportunity to exemplify his great capabilities. The reason I have  decided to write this letter, is because I know you will realize that my father is just a victim of the system. It is a great honor to be able to say that Lorenzo Barajas is my father. If my father is denied, I plan to keep fighting until my father’s name is cleared up and the truth is finally set free. I am a believer of the following quote:” Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true.” My dream is to one day witness my father finally declared innocent of the crime he allegedly committed, and although I know this will be a tough battle, I know that our family is prepared to support my father one hundred percent. I thank you for your time and really appreciate you taking your time in reading this letter. I have faith in this great system and know that everything will be cleared soon. May God Bless, and once again I trust that your judgment will be favorable to my father.
Once again thank you, 
 
Sonia Barajas

The Honorable Jeb Bush

Tallahassee, FL 

Dear Governor Bush:

I write this letter to endorse my good friend, Nathaniel Kidder for an appointment in the circuit court judicial system. I believe he is a qualified candidate for a judicial seat for many reasons.

My friend just ran (and lost) in a local county judge campaign against a person who is not qualified for this judge seat. She won using questionable politics and methods in a non-partisan race. The way Nathaniel handled himself throughout the whole campaign was admirable. He never once stooped to "dirty tricks" or bent the rules in regards to how to run judicial campaign, although you cannot say the same about his opponent. He was endorsed by several reputable organizations and his local newspaper. He showed that he has the right professional and personal ethics that it takes to work in the judicial arena.

My friend has also worked both sides of the legal system though the years and is familiar with both those worlds, which I think is important when you need to listen to both sides and make decisions on judicial matters.

On a personal note, I have never met anyone with more passion and dedication to doing what is right whether is for a client, his family, or towards his friends. He is a loyal and compassionate person and I feel lucky to know him.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you for your recent e-mail to Governor Bush requesting assistance with a child custody matter.  He has asked me to respond.

The Florida Constitution limits the Governor’s intervention in matters that should be resolved through the court system.  
Custody and visitation rulings are under the jurisdiction of the judicial system.  Under Florida law, the court’s decision in these cases is based on the best interest of the child or children involved.  Judges review all of the information presented to them and apply the law to make their decision.    If you are unhappy with a ruling or feel a case has not been handled according to the law, you should speak with an attorney about what appellate procedures may be available.  For those unable to afford a lawyer, Florida Legal Services or the county legal aid association has information about the availability of pro bono counsel.  The main telephone number of Florida Legal Services is (850) 385-7900.  Those dissatisfied with their representatives should consider choosing another attorney.

Of course, should you suspect a child is in any danger, notify your local law enforcement or the Department of Children and Families’ hot line, 1-800-96-ABUSE.

Thank you again for writing.  The Governor is sorry to learn of the problems you are facing and wishes he could be of more assistance.  Please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction, not lack of concern.

Sincerely,

Due to our governor not making or showing ANY INITIATIVE towards lowering the insurance cost, for those of us that are victims of the insurance commissioner; I am "unsubscribing" from further NEWS from your office.
 
I am a Florida native and have never had any flood, wind, lightning or other natural disaster damage to my home.  It is RIDICULOUS to have to pay THREE TIMES the amount of insurance rates that I used to pay, just because others don't know where and how to build their homes!

Pearson.  The contest, Florida's Journey into Neverland, is sponsored by
Just Read, Florida! The contest is the final component of Florida's
year-long reading initiative Shoot for the Stars: A Record-Breaking Year for
Middle Schools.  The Reading in the Arts contest is a wonderful opportunity
for middle school students to get wrapped up in a great book and showcase
their creativity and imagination.  Winners will be selected in the following

JUST READ, FLORIDA! CELEBRATES FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

On Thursday, I recognized our reading initiative, Just Read, Florida!, as it
celebrated its fifth anniversary. Since its inception, Just Read, Florida!
has provided training to more than 45,000 Florida teachers, 4,000 principals
and 2,500 reading coaches to promote and improve reading skills and literacy
for Florida students.  Since the Just Read, Florida! initiative launched,
record numbers of Florida students are reading at or above grade level.  The
Just Read, Florida! initiative strengthens our education system by helping
us reach the goal of every student reading successfully by 2012.  This
research-driven program is helping Florida students make progress in reading
-a necessary skill for success in life.  Established in 2001, the Just Read,
Florida! initiative uses the latest in research-based reading instruction to
boost the reading ability of students.  The program facilitates instruction
for educators, parents and students, while empowering school districts to
implement scientifically-researched reading programs and strategies to
improve student learning.   Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT)
results this year show three-fourths of all Florida third grade students are
reading at or above grade level-the largest number in state history - up
eight percent from last year.  Florida is also closing the achievement gap
in reading.  This year, 61 percent of African-American students are reading
at or above grade level, up from 37 percent in 2001.  Hispanic students
recorded similar increases with 70 percent reading at or above grade level,
up from 46 percent in 2001.  For more information about Just Read, Florida!

MINORITY ENROLLMENT IN FLORIDA'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES INCREASES

On Friday, Carolyn Roberts, chair of the Florida Board of Governors, and I
announced a 4.8 percent increase in minority enrollment in Florida's public
universities. Overall enrollment in the State University System of Florida
increased by more than 7,300 students, to 288,413, a 2.6 percent increase.
Additionally, state universities graduated more than 61,000 students in
2006.  One of Florida's great strengths is our diversity, and the State
University System is building on that strength by providing greater access
to higher education to all our students.  As Florida's accountability
reforms continue to produce record learning gains, more and more students
leave high school ready to pursue a college education.  Enrollment of
African-American students increased by 1.6 percent and enrollment of
Hispanic students increased by 7.3 percent. Minority students now comprise
35.7 percent of students in the 11 institutions of the State University
System, up from 35 percent in Fall 2005. Since 1999, enrollment in Florida's
public universities has grown by more than 55,000 students, or 24 percent.

RE: Need for Appointment of Special Prosecutor To Investigate and empanel grand jury regarding Improper Use of Official Positions and Unlawful Use of Taxpayer Funds to Influence Judicial Election and Outcome of Terri Schindler Schiavo Case

 

   On or about July 2, 2004, a political commercial promoting the reelection of George W. Greer to the office of Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge, Group 18, was filmed on government property, a courtroom in the Pinellas County Courthouse. Participating in the political activity on governmental property in uniform, allegedly while on duty, was William Cunningham, a deputy with the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department.  Deputy Cunningham engaged in the political activity with the full knowledge and consent (and perhaps order)  of Sheriff Everett Rice, according to Marianne Pasha, PCSO public information officer, and according to payroll records, was paid with taxpayer funds for doing so.  Deputy Cunningham appeared in the political with a government-owned vehicle, a Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department patrol car.  

   Also appearing in the political ad with their names and positions identified in writing on the screen were James Hellickson, assistant prosecutor in the office of Sixth Circuit state attorney Bernie McCabe and Paula Shea, assistant in the office of Sixth Circuit public defender Bob Dillinger, allegedly unlawfully using the influence of their titles and positions to attempt to influence a judicial election.

   Also appearing in the political advertisement, allegedly improperly, were court officers and employees of the Sixth Circuit, names unknown.

   Public officers Everett Rice, Bernie McCabe and Bob Dillinger in addition to William Cunningham, James Hellickson and Paula Shea knowingly, willfully and intentionally used the influence and power of their offices and positions and in the case of at least William Cunningham, with the use of taxpayer funds, to attempt to influence the outcome of a judicial election, in essence controlling a judgeship and controlling the outcome of the Terri Schindler Schiavo case at a time when Sheriff Rice and Prosecutor McCabe had steadfastly refused to perform the duties of their respective offices to investigate matters of alleged criminal wrongdoing in the Schiavo case.

 

   Under Article IV, Section 1(a) Florida Constitution, the governor is vested with “supreme executive power”.  Further, the Governor “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed” and commissions “all officers of the state and counties”.

   Under the general law of the state, the governor may, by executive order filed with the Department of State, assign state attorneys “one of more specified investigations, cases or matters. Specifically, Section 27.14(1) Florida Statutes provides if any state attorney is disqualified to represent the state in any investigation, case or matter pending in the courts of his or her circuit or if, for any other good and sufficient reason, the Governor determines that the ends of justice would be best served, the Governor may, by executive order filed with the Department of State, either order an exchange of circuits or of courts between such state attorney and any other state attorney or order an assignment of any state attorney to discharge the duties of the state attorney with respect to one or more specified investigations, cases or matters specified in general in the executive order of the Governor.

   In this case, it is mandatory that a special prosecutor be assigned to investigate this matter as Mr. McCabe, state attorney for the Sixth Circuit, is directly and personally involved in the matter and would be a subject of the investigation as well as an employee of his office, therefore Mr. McCabe has a prohibited conflict of interest and must be disqualified.

   As Governor, you frequently issue executive orders appointing another state attorney to investigate and prosecute cases free from the taint of appearance of conflict of interest or impropriety. 

   Good and sufficient reason exists for the Governor to determine that the ends of justice would be best served by assigning another state attorney to investigate the alleged improper use of public office, public funds and government property to influence the outcome of a judicial election and ultimately the outcome of the high profile Schiavo case.

   “A public office is a public trust” Section Article II, §8(a) Florida Constitution. Moreover, “the people shall have the right to secure and sustain that trust against abuse.  

   The issue at hand involves official misconduct in Pinellas County related to the judicial election of George W. Greer during 2004 and in particular, the Primary of Aug. 31, 2004 as it relates to his political commercial aired between Aug. 9, 2004 and Aug. 30, 2004.

   The matter involves some or all of the following acts or omissions:  Abuse of the pubic trust (Art. II, Section 8(a) Florida Constitution, breach of the public trust for private gain and inducing others to breach the public trust for private gain (Art. II, Section 5, Florida Constitution) violations of Florida’s Code of Ethics including but not limited to Section 112.313(2) FS, 112.313(6) and 112.317. 

   The immediate assignment of a special prosecutor to investigate this matter is requested

Dear Chairman Bush, 

 

I know you like to be called by your first name; it’s not my preference. 

However, since this seems to be a ‘folksy’ preference of yours, I will do so in the body of this letter. 

 

After reading the newspaper today, I decided to offer my personal opinion

of your article “driving our economy higher, with Integrity ‘ . 

 

Jeb, ‘chummy’ with large industry was not a good idea. It cannot be undone. 

 

What do you mean” with integrity “? “ EFI board members do not vote or offer 

their input. “

 

These people don’t vote on the boards. They don’t have to, as the tax payers subsidize their meetings and CEO’s large salary (such as Mr. Adams). 

 

The same people on the EFI boards are your advisors / investor board, also lobby the legislature and are ‘ guest speakers’ at Public service commission meetings. 

 

I read the CEO of a large company influenced YOU to apply for a Federal Grant. I don’t know if this is true. I don’t know if he could have signed it himself. I don’t think he could sign one now. 

 

I note new interest in the company assets of that public ticker.  

 

I see sharks circling.  They will certainly give you up before themselves.

Do you know a colloquial meaning of ‘chum ‘in Florida? I’ve been here all my life and you now appear to be ‘chum’ of potential ‘investors’. 

 

It’s risky business to swim with sharks.  I’d watch my back if I were you. People with that much money and influence could tap phones, hack computers and do anything to achieve their requisite purpose. 

 

I read you’re the “E governor”! You must like high tech stuff. I read of commercial C band satellite for survellaience with microwaves. How cool might this be ? Wow ! 

 

What you have ( or did  have ) , was the trust , monies,  land and other properties of the residents of this state. 

 

As far as accountability goes; I noted the state audit on line and it appears there are red flags in regard to DEP land transactions. 

 

When there are private interests involved, it’s difficult and tedious to determine who got what and for what value.  

 

When there are many parties rivaling for the assets (taxpayers included), eventually somebody is thrown behind the boat. 

 

I did read many years ago, you said you couldn’t find a decent cup of coffee in Tallahassee. Jeb, there’s plenty of good coffee in Tallahassee. No one was pouring any in your cup. 

 

That’s from me, 50 year old Leon County; CAPITAL CITY girl. 

 

 

Yours very truly I am,

Good evening Governor Bush and Lt. Governor Jennings, 

 

I want to start off by saying congratulations on eight great years for the State of Florida.  I look forward to your future political endeavors.

I’m writing to request a simple favor of you.  I’d been employed with Orange County Fire Rescue in Orlando for just over 20 years, until this past April.  Four years ago I was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy that has slowly affected my ability to climb ladders and stairs.  Because I have a family history of MD, I was expecting this, so I became a training officer as not to affect the safety of my crew.  After four years in the training division, with very little progression of the disease, the Fire Chief in Orange County decided ‘This is the new fire department, and we don’t accommodate anyone anymore.’   As you can imagine, I was floored by this news.  I had spent several years preparing for this position and acquiring the necessary instructor certifications through the State of Florida, only to be told that my years of experience and knowledge as a Fire Officer and Paramedic were no longer valid because of my limited disability.  This termination came less than five years from reaching my retirement date.  Not to mention, at a time when I have two children in college.

 

I’m simply asking if you could discuss this matter with Mayor Crotty in Orange County.  All of my inquiries to him have been unanswered, and I would appreciate if you could pass on my information so I might meet with him.

 

I appreciate your time and want to thank you again for your service to our great State.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Nathaniel B. Kidder, Esquire is a nominee for a Circuit Judge vacancy in Pinellas County. I am writing this letter of recommendation to respectfully request that you appoint Mr. Kidder to that position.  He has earned unprecedented respect from the legal community, attorneys and judges alike. As a Judge, his ability to remain impartial would never be questioned.

 

I have known Nat Kidder for over 15 years, both personally and professionally. He is an individual of integrity and honesty. To those he serves, he is not only a scholar of the law, but a hard working, tenacious and compassionate professional. He is a man of the highest personal standards and treasures his family life.  

 

Mr. Bush, you have the opportunity to select the most qualified and best suited individual to serve as a Judge.  I urge you to show your full and unqualified support to Nathanial Kidder by appointing him to Judge of the Circuit Court. 

 

Thank you for your time.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Mr.Geb Bush, My name is Elizabeth Wright. I go to Enest Ward Middle School. As you might know my school was called an "A" school for acheiving our goals on FCAT. We work very hard all year preping for FCAT, and it shows in our scores. My FCAT scores were very high, and I accepted a Certificate of Achievement from the FCAT people. I have learned very much about flordia and it's people from the goverment web site. On the web site I read that you come to small communitys and met verious people. I think my school and commuinty would enjoy a visit from you. So if you ever come around Pensacola, we (the people of Walnut Hill) would enjoy meting you!

Subject:	PARDON me....help!

Dear Governor:
 
     I am desperate for assistance and not exactly sure it is you who can help, but Lord knows I have prayed my heart out over this matter, and believe I may have a good chance with you.  I am a Christian in an excellent church.
     I am a single mom in Key West, FL doing everything in my power to excel for the sake of my little girl - she's 6.  I recently graduated from the Community College here (FKCC) with an Associates in Arts degree AND a Certificate degree in Addiction-Studies.  I am pursuing my dream of Counseling addicts and alcoholics...I wish to have a title: Certfied Addiction Professional (CAP) under the Florida Board.
     The stumbling block in my path is an extreme criminal history...mind you, they are only felony charges of my past addiction (almost 13 yrs of crack abuse and prostitution from 1985 - 1997...in Prison 4 different times).  I have been totally sober 9 years. I will also tell you, regretfully, that my child's father had me charged with Stalking him ( sentence completed Feb 2005)...I was only chasing my Child Support, but needless to say I had no choice but to plead out  ( or else lose custody of my little girl).  I have been invited to earn my Bachelors degree in Jacksonville at University of North Florida.  I am currently waiting for an acceptance letter. I will be 43yrs young next month in October.
     Governor, the one thing I am requesting from you is to help me do SOMETHING about my record.  I was told no matter how many degrees I earn in University I may NEVER get to be in Counseling because I can not be hired anywhere...I can NOT pass a background check...yet I have a 3.6 GPA, 2 degrees from the Community College, and going on to earn my Bachelors either in Psychology or Social Work....PLEASE HELP! I may even wish to go on to Christian Counseling!  I was told you and / or the Senator have granted full pardons in such cases as mine...people who have 180' turned their lives around...my life is ALL for the glory of my Saviour Jesus Christ, and to give a better life of opportunity to my child. I will eagerly await your reply
 
GOD BLESS YOU!

Subject:	Dr. Howard Kessler (Republican)

Governor Bush

My Name is Anthony (Tony) Cartlidge, and I am the Vice Chairman of the 
Republican Party of Wakulla County, and have been for the last 5 years.

I have a concern that needs addressing, and has been dealt with by your 
office. This concern of mine is about our Republican County 
Commissioner, by the name of Dr. Howard Kessler.

He is the only upstanding, and true representative of the people here in 
Wakulla County.

Since he is so outspoken against certain items that appear before him at 
Commission meeting, (poorly planned development, and projects harmful to 
our local environment), everything is being done to eliminate him from 
office. He is up for re-election, and those "Good Old Boys" wish to see 
him vanquished.

Your office was petitioned by the local powers to be, to get the State 
attorney, "Willie" N. Meggs, to pursue this mater of trumped up 
accusations against Dr. Kessler's choice to not vote at a illegal 
meeting. That meeting was in fact a form of secret meeting that was 
unwarranted, (claimed to be an emergency) called to address the 
resignation of the County administrator. That is not a threat to the 
public warranting any emergency. Furthermore, very few people knew of 
the meeting since it had no real advertising other than a sign on a 
couple of County buildings. Buildings that have very low use.by the 
General Public. That is why Dr. Howard Kessler opted to remove himself 
from sitting at the board and chose not to participate in that meeting.

I have since discover that the State Attorney  "Willie" N. Meggs, a 
person with close County ties, has asked you to remove Dr. Kessler. He 
also has failed to address the legality of the meeting based on the 
reason for the emergency. Can any meeting be deemed an emergency just by 
saying it is? Can putting up a couple of signs on doors of Govt. be a 
concerned effort to notify the Public? Is it impossible to run a County 
if the administrator resigned, but was also asked to stay on for a 
period of time till a replacement can be found? This was no emergency, 
and all could have waited till the regular meeting which is every two 
weeks. No sir, this is a political game to eject a concerned politician 
for the opposite Party who stands for the people, and not the business 
as usual way of things. They are afraid that they will not be able to 
defeat Dr. Kessler in the upcoming Nov. Elections. They know he is the 
peoples choice.

Dr. Kessler was the very first Republican to ever be elected to any 
office in this County (Wakulla), and has made the most significant 
advancements on behalf of the public than any other elected official. He 
is a servant of the people, and not a person looking for self gain, or 
wealth,  as so many are. Please do your best to address the truth of 
this mater, and to help this fine dedicated Republican retain his 
position. The people in November can make this choice.

Sincerely

Tony Cartlidge
Vice Chairman, Republican Party of Wakulla County

Dear Mr Bush
 
I have written to you before about the bad press the US is getting in the UK regarding security and security staff on entering the US.
 
I am a home owner in Florida and have a great interest in the US particularly in the opinion of the British people and their desire to visit the US.  My villa rentals have decreased and I know the attitude of security on entering the US has some part to play in this.
 
May I suggest you read the article that I am sending you and perhaps pass it on to the powers that be in Homeland Security so that hopefully some influence by you can be made to stop this unfriendly attitude continuing.
 
www.telegraph.co.uk
 
Then go to Travel and at the bottom of the page you will see and article called Will you visit the US.  When you click on there it is the top article on that page.  I believe it is headed up Will you fly to the US.
 
I hope that this email is read by you and you will be able to do something about it.  This subject must be addressed by the powers that be otherwise Florida's visitors from the UK will decrease more and more.  Not something either of us want.
 
Yours sincerely

Mr. Bush, I'm writing regarding the extradition papers that are currently waiting for you signature. This is regarding the case of Oliver Travis Oquinn, who was a registered RN at Shands in Gainesville and MURDERED my niece in November of 2005.  He then decided to leave the country and flee to Ireland. Why the DA's office in Alachua have dragged their feet iis beyond me.  Since then , Mr. Oquinn was then captured after he ran from the African army and brought back to New York by the US Marshall Service June 18. (his fathered wired him money to stay away, passport was flagged he got caught) 
From my understanding the DA's office finally did their job, and you now have the papers for over a month to get this pervert back in Florida where he needs to be.....
i would appreciate an immediate response to this situation. I really believe that waiting this long for a signure is just outragous.
By the way my niece was 24 years old at the time of her MURDER, and was graduating from UF in December. Her date of death was Nov 8, and her body was found by her fiance on Nov 10. She is orginally from Live Oak, Fl. I hope you know where this town located. it is a very small town, Michelle was born and raised here, graduated. Her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncle still and always will live in this small town.
 
I will wait for your reply, and I hope that you will take her MURDER seriously, because this KILLER needs to come back to Florida to be responsible for his actions.
 
Thank You

Dear Honorable Mr. Bush,

      As an alumni and a former employee of Florida School for the Deaf 
and the Blind(FSDB), I want to tell you that I am so pleased to know 
that you  have selected a fine deaf man named Chris Wagner as a member 
of Board of Trustees at FSDB.

      Even though I have never met Mr. Wagner, I am truly impressed with 
his dedication as an exemplary advocator for deaf people.  Without a 
doubt, Deaf alumni, employees and citizens are so thrilled to have him 
as a member of the Board.

      Despite being a victim of social injustice during Dawson 
Administration while I was an employee, I have to admit that the school 
is one of the finest schools for the deaf in the world in terms of 
facilities, government-support finance, outreach programs, size of 
student population, sports programs, publicity and parents involvement.  
If I live in Fla -I live in NC- and my children are deaf, it is 
undeniable that I will send my kids to that school.

      Thank God for having you as an open-minded person as well as a 
politician who believes that Deaf people with lack of spoken language 
are capable of reasoning.  I want to share you a brief story from an 
alumnus named John Burns of Tallahassee who proudly told me that while 
he was walking at near your state-owned house, you saw him.  Then you 
made a gesture as you warmly greeted and invited him to enter your 
state-owned home several years ago.  That story really amazed me.  I 
believe he told that story a hundred times to his acquaintances.

      Again, many thanks for your faith in Chris Wagner as a Deaf citizen 
who will contribute his wisdom to the deaf children at my alma mater.

Truly yours,
Tom Krohn

Dear Jeb,
 
I wanted to let you know that Patty Berg is at Hope Hospice in Ft. Myers. You know how fond of your family she has been through the years-and you may recall me telling you that your grandfather Prescott presented her with her first golf medal.   When I was at her home 
last week,I noticed the portrait of Patty and Prescott making that presentation.. Patty was in the Marine Corp. and I thought it might be nice to get an American Flag that was flown over Florida's Capitol Building to have at her service.Can the flag be flown at half mast when she passes or is that only allowed for political dignitaries?I wasn't sure of  the rules. I was telling her personal assistant today about the time you were both guests in my home, and how she kept poking you in the side every time someone would get your attention-so you would re focus on her!!! She always enjoyed discussing politics.Tobi (her assistant) commented on how much Patty loved your family, and always spoke so highly of all of you. I will keep you informed, as I knew you and your family would want to know.
 
Thanks Jeb,
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	Legal Notice Requirement Suggestion

Hello,
We have a suggestion regarding the rules and regulations regarding notices to homeowners and businesses.  It is our finding that the industrial companies placing an ad in the news paper should also be required under law to send surrounding property owners/homeowners information regarding their plans or permit they are submitting.  The newspaper articles do not support our technological society anymore.  We missed our opportunity to fight for our rights when articles state â€œif you do not respond you waive your rightsâ€.  That is just unconstitutional!  Most people in todayâ€™s busy world do not have the time or energy to read every little legal notice in the paper or even subscribe.  It is very heartbreaking for us to be 4 years down the road and unable to fight an air quality permit that was approved in 2001 that we were not aware of since we did not subscribe to any local news papers.  Please do something to help the residents and businesses of Florida by protecting them and invoke better communication with notices in the future.  Please increase the requirements of all businesses or individuals placing notices to also send regular mail and place large signage on the property with the notice information on the land being affected.  The small classified ads just do not work anymore.  We are living proof!

This year, Comcast Miami-Dade will be partnering with His House Children's Home located at 20000 NW 47th Avenue, Opa Locka, FL 33055. His House is a children’s home which houses abused and neglected kids. The organization provides services ranging from residential services, case-management, an in-house counseling center, The His House Academy, after-school tutoring, weekly athletic, art and dance programs, in addition to foster and adoption placement. All programs are specifically designed and targeted to meet the needs of the whole child.


I have attached some information regarding the event for your review. I am requesting to set a meeting with Jeanie Hernandez Director of Community Relations to meet with Governor Jeb Bush to discuss Comcast's community outreach initiative at his earliest convenience. In addition to this, we are also extending an invitation for the Governor to attend the event on October 7th as well as requesting a Proclamation.

Please feel free to contact Jeanie Hernandez at 305.770.5316 or myself at 305.770.5337 with any questions or concerns.

Subject:	Regarding Wakulla Commissioner Howard Kessler, MD

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing in support of Wakulla County Commissioner Howard  
Kessler. In my experience, I have observed Dr. Kessler to be a  
courageous and principled advocate for his constituents, the Florida  
environment, and transparent, representative democracy. This has  
often put him at odds with his fellow Commissioners who have  
disagreed  with his positions as well as some constituents whose  
interests are affected by his votes. None-the-less, few could  
honestly argue that Dr. Kessler has not firmly stood on his beliefs,  
with integrity and civility, in the face of overwhelming and constant  
adversity from the Wakulla Commission.

I understand Dr. Kessler is so dedicated to performing his  
responsibilities that he has even undertaken special training in  
being a Commissioner.  It is ironic that he has been alleged to have  
not fulfilled his responsibilities in failing to vote [without a  
declared conflict of interest] when his fast held conviction was in  
fact concerning the very illegitimacy of the meeting.  Well, we all  
make errors, and a trial jury might possibly sort out whether the  
State Prosecutor Willie Meggs'  findings could be proven. But, to  
what end would this serve? Prove that a good man, with exemplary  
record and commitment to public service, came to an incorrect  
conclusion in good conscience? Or perhaps, this could be used as an  
example to drive away committed and qualified people from public  
service to demonstrate low tolerance for dissent.

Governor Bush, Wakulla County is facing a lot of growth challenges as  
Monroe County experienced in the past. It is at the threshold of  
cultural, geographic, and political changes which has led to much  
turmoil. You may recall that a few years ago Monroe needed the  
intervention of DCA to straighten things out and restore public  
interests and Wakulla needed your intervention on tax assessments.  I  
know you believe in mentoring for youth. It may be time for Wakulla  
to get a little more help from the State to mentor our small county  
through the pains of growing up.

I urge you to not give a de-facto endorsement of the tactics being  
employed to eliminate a conscientious and principled, duly elected  
official from office on an alleged (and unproven) technical violation  
of a statute that does not specify a penalty.  The voters will have  
the opportunity to speak within the next few months on Dr. Kessler's  
continued service.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I would like to appeal to your for your help. I was served with an injunction by a vindictive former girlfriend for "repeat violence" issued by Hon. Durand J. Adams of the 12th Judicial
Circuit for manatee Cty on Nov. 22 2006.Case # 2005-DR-5993. This has been caused by erroneous emails. Judge Adams granted the injunction even though I was served at 5:30 pm on Nov. 21 to appear at 9:00 am Nov. 22. I had no chance to obtain legal representation nor was I advised of my right to venue. My attorney has been somewhat useless and like a boat, I'm throwing what money I have into a hole in the water.
I be live that he granted the injunction simply to get rid of the petitioner who had been before him at least 7 times regarding injunctions relating to her ex-husband. The idea of "repeat violence" is absurd and a travesty of justice as there had never been any sort of threat and I had not been within 30 miles of the petitioner for some 6 years.
The court granted me all of my firearms rights, but has suspended my Fl. CCW. The result is that I cannot practice my day trade of training high-level principal  protection personnel, and I am also a cert. master gunsmith. I wish to retire soon and because of this, I cannot receive my FFL or gunsmithing lic. so I can open the shop I have been planning & dreaming of for years for my retirement. I am suffering great financial hardship and my planned retirement is ruined.
I beg of you, Mr. Bush for your intercession in this matter. If your office cannot help, please, please guide me in the right direction. My livelyhood depends upon it.
 
God Bless You,

WOW!   Republicans behaving like JACKASSES on TV..... where are the elephants?
 
While I have no strong feelings about Katherine Harris... she IS the Republican candidate... and BILL NELSON is the true JACKASS opponent.  I've known Bill since high school... and would be delighted to see him living in Melborne full-time again!
 
I am embarrassed and horrified by the national news coverage emphasizing that JEB does NOT support Harris.  
 
Since I was a local chairman in Gainesville to ellect JEB, since I dutifully go to the scroungiest poll place each election day as a "WATCHER"... which is not even safe to do... since I sit at a phone bank for hours talking to strangers on behalf of the PARTY...      
 I have earned a voice to request some damage control be put out to help BEAT BILL... and send a Republican to the Senate.
 
Please contact me about what you intend to do...(make it GOOD)  and how I can best assist.

DEAR TONI JENNINGS,
 
WE NEW YORKERS ARE BEING TAXES OUT OF FLORIDA. MANY OF US SNOW BIRDS AND THINKING SERIOUSLY THAT WE SHOULD SELL OUR CONDOS IN FLORIDA BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE GETTING TO HIGH.
 
I WONDER HOW FLORIDA WILL SURVIVE IF US NEW YORKERS AND THOSE FROM BOSTON, MAINE, NEW JERSEY, ETC. ALL SOLD THEIR PLACES IN FLORIDA???
WE SIMPLY CANNOT PAY THESE HIGH TAXES WHERE WE LIVE AND THEN HAVE TO PAY HIGH TAXES IN FLORIDA FOR A PLACE THAT WE USE FOR A FEW MONTHS.
 
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD TAKE TIME TO SEND YOU THIS NOTE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE ARE ALL THINKING THESE DAYS. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE HAVING MEETINGS ON THE TAX ISSUES, BUT I AM NOT SURE IF YOU ARE DISCUSSING THE SNOW BIRD'S TAXES. SOME OF US CANNOT BECOME FLORIDA RESIDENTS TO PAY LOWER TAXES AND WE ARE REALLY GETTING HIT HARD WITH FLORIDA TAXES AND OUR HOME TOWN TAXES. PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO NORTH CAROLINA NOW BECAUSE OF THE LOW PRICED HOMES AND LOW TAXES. AND I MEAN LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM HERE AND EVERYWHERE.
 
WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SELL ONE CONDO FOR OVER A YEAR AND WHEN PEOPLE HEAR HOW HIGH THE TAXES ARE, THEY WALK AWAY.  I HAVE TWO CONDOS AND EACH IS OVER $5000.00 IN TAXES. WHO WANTS, OR WHO CAN PAY THESE TAXES. THE TAXES ARE NOT ONLY HIGH FOR NEW RESIDENTS BUT ARE VERY HIGH FOR  NON RESIDENTS WHO HAVE TO ALSO PAY TAXES WHERE THEY LIVE.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE CAN PAY HIGH TAXES IN NEW YORK AND ALSO IN FLORIDA.
 
JUST WANTED TO YELL OUT...HOPE SOMEONE HEARS ME BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE..

I am currently moving along in Criminal Justice and I have come upon a thought.... One afternoon I received a letter in the mail from the Florida Parole Commission stating that all my civil rights were restored back to me (Clemency); however, I know this does not allow me to own or posses a firearm, but I would like to have these rights restored as well. How would I go about restoring these rights? And it has been at least six years since I have been in trouble, and my charges did not reflect any sort of violence or violent crime. Would you be able to assist me in this field?

Many thanks to you and Mrs. Bush for your support of the Florida House.  From 1998 to 2005, I was the Director of Government Affairs at the Jacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce.  The Chamber hosts an annual lobbying trip to Washingting.  And, each year as part of that lobbying trip, we held an event at the Florida House.  It is an excellent resource for Floridians.  

It was good to see you in Norteast Florida again today.  However, it was difficult to hear you speak the words describing moving out of the Governor's office.  You are a beloved Governor.  I hope you run for President.

We all the community will appreciate anything you can do for us and I can tell you that I already try to talk to the county manager but he did not want to talk to me,maybe because I'm poor and do not have a big name or any influence but I'm begging for help for our community we need businesses.

Governor Bush,

 

I mailed the below note to you on the 25th so I'm sure you haven't had a chance to read it yet.  I did feel it was important for me to also point out the following information.

 

I was registered under the commodity/group number for "transcription, all types."  While researching why I was not given the purchase order to continue transcribing for the DOC Inspector General's Office, I spoke to Mr. Larry Daugherty.  He advised that I should register as a "court reporter" so that I could be advised of any transcription bids going out since court reporters also perform transcription.  Although I disagreed on whether or not I should have registered as such, being that I'm NOT a court reporter, I have done so at Mr. Daugherty's direction.  

 

Many of the people who are registered under the commodity/group number for "transcription, all types" are simply parents who need to stay home with their children but also need to work in order to provide for their families.  By awarding the contracts without soliciting bids to those who registered under what we were advised was our correct commodity/group numbers means that there are many self-employed people who no longer have the option of being self-employed.  Those people must now make other choices regarding employment and/or whether they want to do business with the State of Florida.  

 

I know you and your office are extremely busy.  However, I felt it was important to advise you that the State is spending money needlessly while not allowing those who have registered under the MyFlorida commodity groups to be able to bid on work.  If this is the way bids are normally handled by the State, it appears the MyFlorida process would rather deal with larger companies, has no interest in saving money and/or does not know how to bid out the work.  To advise transcriptionists to register under a commodity group that the State then ignores results in those people not receiving any bid solicitations.

Dear Governor Bush
 
I want to take this opportunity to write to you to express my support for Wakulla County Commissioner Howard Kessler.  I understand that the State Attorney agreed with the Wakulla Attorney that Dr. Kessler was incorrect in his actions regarding the emergency meeting held earlier this year about  Parrish Barwick's conflict of interest.
 
I am sure you have heard and read all the facts regarding the circumstances leading up to the meeting.  
 
I believe Dr. Kessler and support his belief, that in his opinion, there was no real emergency.  Many of the citizens here also agree that the "firing" of Mr. Barwick was not an "emergency" but simply a way to get Mr. Barwick an additional large severance package that the commission had just added to his new contract, with minimum notice to the citizens, at a time inconvenient for citizens to attend a meeting, and with NO input by the citizens. 
 
Dr. Kessler has shown, over and over, by his actions, that he is a man of the highest integrity and did so again here by following his beliefs.
 
I am not savy enough to know what repercussions may happen to Dr. Kessler but I implore you, if you must do anything about this ruling by the State Attorney, do the absolute minimum possible.  Wakulla County needs Dr Kessler.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Sincerely,

I'm told that TSA is in the final stages of completing the paperwork for the national rollout. Please do all you can so that TSA proceeds now with no further delay. Millions of "road warriors" across the country want to join the 27,000 Registered Travelers in Orlando — and all of us want to be able to use Registered Traveler wherever we fly.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing in regard to the letter that has been sent from your office to Commissioner Kessler of Wakulla County (a story was on the WCTV news last night).

I have lived in Wakulla County since 1988, and worked for the County Commission from 1990 - 1993, and I have not known a more honest, trustworthy commissioner that truly cares about THE PEOPLE and stands behind his word. Dr. Kessler is not the commissioner for our district, my own commissioner has never answered emails in regard to problems in our district, he has never returned phone calls, I called Dr. Kessler and he personally came to our subdivision and spoke with anyone who was available to speak their concerns to him. He has done more for our district and this county than ANY of the commissioners. 

There are people in this county that would like nothing more than for you to take away his position...please, speak to the people first - listen to the people who have seen the good this man has done and hopefully will continue to do. To a lot of the "older" county (those born and raised here) he is an outsider and they really resent any one not born and raised here.....period. I have watched the televised meetings and seen other commissioners mock him, and disrespect this man by refusing to call him Doctor Kessler, this is an intelligent, educated man who I don't believe has ever disrespected or mocked anyone.

Governor Bush,
 
I read the article in Tuesday's Democrat regarding the Boundless Playgrounds.  My nephew attends Crawfordville Elementary School and is currently unable to play at recess because his walker will not maneuver through most things.  This is the main school that the handicap attend in Wakulla County and I would love to see one put there.
 
Currently there are two classes of handicap children at the school and most are unable to play on the standard playgrounds.  After looking at the website for Boundless Playgrounds I have noticed that the majority of these in Florida are located in the southern part of the State.  I would like to ask that you really consider Crawfordville Elementary or a park in Wakulla County as a site for these children.  If there is anything I can do to help with this please just ask.
 
Thank you.

 Dear Mr. Jeb Bush, 
 
 
I am a resident of Mobile, Alabama at the present time.  However, I was
born and raised in Picayune Mississippi (Pear River County). 
 I went through a hard spot in my life at a early age, got on drugs pretty bad and
committed some crimes.  I served 10 years in prison for my mistakes.  8
years in Parchmond, Mississippi; and 2 years in Santa Rosa County,Florida.  
I have been out of prison for 6+ years (released from Santa Rosa County in 1999) 
and I'm wanting to request a pardon from the State of Florida and am
curious as to how I go about doing so.  I am married, have recently
purchased a home, and have been at a steady job for the past year.  I am
not asking for my "rights" back as far as voting or carrying a firearm. I
would like my criminal record to be placed in, I know that youthful offender doesn't apply to me,
but similar to a "youthful offender" type status.  So that, If I ever get into trouble again, it all comes back out, but when applying for employment and such, It wont show up.  I am trying my hardest
to be a good citizen and a good person, but it is very discouraging when you apply
for a job that you are well qualified for and people see your criminal record and don't give you
a chance to prove you've been rehabilitated. 
 I can give you several personal references, including active federal employees, if
you require them.  Thank you for your time and attention.  Please reply
via U.S. Mail. as the email address I am sending this from is my wife's
work email address.
  
My home address is
609 Mandrell Street    Mobile, AL 36606
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	REDISTRICTING IS UN-CONSTITUIOTNAL !

 

Re-districting is election and vote control !  It is ILLEGAL !  IT is AGAINST OUR CONSTITUTION !  Anything that effects (and denies) the free vote of the people, is UN-Constitutional !
 
In fact the entire election and candidate process in this nation today is totally Un-Constitutional !
 
 
 It's stealing the vote and the election !  It totally controls the vote and who gets in office !  IT controls who votes and who doesn't !
 
So is what some states have (like Florida) that Elite Republicans have also set up is the 'partisan only primary voting' !  Also UN-Constitutional and illegal !  It denies the people of their right to vote for state offices that effect THEM !  The primaries are set up for the Elite 'clicks' only !  Those elections effect EVERYONE and EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THEM !
 
I was denied my right to vote on anything in this primary !
I got this tiny paper handed to me with only 4 unknown local judges to vote on and that was it !  Not one state office was I allowed to vote on !  I was denied to vote on those who will be supposedly 'my employees' (Remember WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE the gov't ?) yet I have no voice in any of it !  THAT is NOT a free vote !  That is UN-Constitutional and illegal !  THAT is Communism !
You have to be a part of and member of "their Elite click" in order to be able to vote !  This is ILLEGAL !
 
And - THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED to HAVE ANY VOTE OR MENTION AT ALL !  NOW THAT IS DICTATORSHIP AT IT'S FINEST !  It is exactly how Saddam and Arafat did their elections !  And the media plays along with it !  Shame on them for being controlled like this and partaking in this  illegal dictatorship ! !  This makes the media an assessory to the crime !
  
The PEOPLE do not want (as all the polls show) either of the One World parties (Dems/Repubs) - they want a third party !  But since this dictatroship is no longer a gov't of the PEOPLE,  the people have no say !
 
What ever happened to the 'gov't of, by, and FOR the PEOPLE !?
1860 ENDED THE PEOPLE being THE GOVERNMENT !  THAT IS WHEN DICTATORSHIP REALLY TOOK OVER with this Elite Republican party politics !  THAT is when our Founder's gov't, nation , and our Constitution DIED  !  The Elite has kept control of this Corporation they call a 'government', since 1860, and via their Elite two-party-ONLY system !
 
 
"Re-districting" and this partisan  only voting system is a Saddam/Arafat TYPE ELECTION SYSTEM !  It's one of the things DICTATORSHIPS DO !
This is all part of the plan to destroy America and make it a full nation-state of his One World Order that is well under way now !
And we all KNOW WHO is repsonsible for that !
 
Change things back to freedom and a free vote the way our Constitution says it is to be !
 
The people have been pushed too far now and are ready to revolt !  WE have had it !  And hundreds have screamed how they have had it with all the over-building in Florida so many no longer even have water !  WE have lost our true Florida soul with all these tax-greedy developments going up with houses on top of each other !  Whole communities have been gutted !  The people are beyond mad !  And by the way, land and income taxes are totally UN-CONSTITUTIONAL !  That Lincoln 'Amendment" is illegal and was never passed or ratified !  It goes completely against our ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION, which is the Constituion true Patriots go by !  ALL our Constitutions are all still in effect, and the Patriots are about to use one of them to take our nation  back !  That goes for the states also.  Politicians are not in touch with the public and what THEY stand for and on.  A few pretty butterfly words to get elected don't fly with us anymore !
 
HIstory DOES repeat itslef just as God says it does.
WE are re-living the 1860 political era again !

Good Morning Commissioner Winn: As part of an assignment for one of my
Ed.D.degree course (EDD-8007, Dynamics of Managing Institutions of
Higher Education: Policies and Practices) at Nova Southeastern
University, I am writing to you on two important matters, to seek your
intervention and assistance.
 
1. Having read your website, I note your recent announcement of the
"SUCCEED Florida!" grants press conference and the opportunities that
will be offered and made available for students in various critical
workforce areas. However, the workforce areas targeted by this
initiative, did not include a critical workforce area in the aviation
industry, that is, in the airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanics
workforce area. The current average age of A&P mechanics is in the late
50s---based on my personal observations! Therefore, in about another 10
to 15 years time, unless this State or this Nation can encourage and
attract many students to this workforce area, our aviation industry will
be in critical need of qualified and competent A&P mechanics to service
and maintain our increasing high technology fleet of airplanes. This
shortage of A&P mechanics will therefore threaten the safety and
economic viability of the aviation industry and our Nation's ability to
compete in the International market place. I would strongly encourage
your Administration to seriously consider this matter and appropriately
intervene in a timely manner, to preserve our Nation's competitive
advantages in the International marketplace. Please be advised that I am
also currently teaching aeronautical and aerospace engineering courses
at FIU and I also sit on the Miami-Dade County CTAC Board (Aviation
sub-committee chairperson) and I am therefore very much aware of this
disturbing trend and issue, in the aviation industry.
 
2. As part of my Ed.D. degree program completion, I am doing my Applied
Dissertation on "Strategies for reducing mathematics driven attrition in
a university's declared engineering majors." Subject to all necessary
and appropriate IRB approvals, I will be quantitatively analyzing
de-identified SUS longitudinal data and collecting additional
qualitative survey data of incumbent students, to draw inferences,
conclusions, make recommendations and formulating strategies, pursuant
to completing this work. Your assistance and support in this endeavor,
is hereby respectfully requested. As you can appreciate, we all need to
find a way to increase degree completion of our enrolled university
students, in order to be cost-effective with our educational
dollars---but more importantly, to adequately prepare our students to be
successful in our future largely populated, highly technological and
highly scientific world.
 
Please feel free to call me with related questions and/or concerns.
Thanks very much and best regards.

I am writing to urge that the Registered Traveler program be rolled out across the country ASAP, as TSA has promised.

Registered Traveler is one of the few best deals around for this country's air travelers. It's voluntary. It costs the government and airports nothing. It gives travelers a predictably, convenient, speedy and SECURE experience getting through the airport's checkpoint. Also, biometric IDs represent a means for increasing our national security beyond this particular program. TSA's resources can be more focused on those who have not been pre-screened. It ensures that the non-Registered Traveler lines move faster, too. Registered Traveler is cutting-edge technology and old-fashioned common sense.

I'm told that TSA is in the final stages of completing the paperwork for the national rollout. Please do all you can so that TSA proceeds now with no further delay. Millions of "road warriors" across the country want to join the 27,000 Registered Travelers in Orlando  and all of us want to be able to use Registered Traveler wherever we fly.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
    Please allow me to take a moment of your time to recommend Dorothy Vaccaro for the vacant circuit court position in the 6th Judicial Circuit.  I have know Ms. Vaccaro for the past couple of years and find her to be a person of outstanding character.  Her presence on the bench will be a fine legacy to your leadership.

Governor Bush – 

 

Not sure if you even get to read these emails, but hoping you will get this one.

 

I want to thank you for your service as governor.  I am a registered Independent – Democrat leanings.  But you have been a responsible administrator, financially conservative, and I believe that you have tried to balance the needs of all the interests in our State.  

 

Though I had some serious doubts about a “Bush” running Florida (just a political stepping stone, etc), you were right there with “us” during 2004 and all those hurricanes.    There was an overall game plan, and you stuck to it.  You insisted that we pull in the spending after 9/11 – less tourist tax dollars – very responsible; very pro-active.  

 

My husband & I wish you the best, and hope you stay active in Florida government.

My Name is Mirtha Troche Social Security #[REDACTED], In 2002 I was accused and arrested for grand theft and forgery.  Due to poor attorney representation I took a plea deal in January 2005.  I have filed a separate complaint against the attorney "Yale Galanter".  I was a US resident since 1994 and I'm married to a US citizen and have a 6 year old daughter and a 7 month old baby.  They are both US citizens.  Because taking a plea (withheld adjudication), I became deportable by immigration standards.  I was ordered deportable on January 12th, 2006.  The only venue for me to be able to go back to the country that I've known as my home for so many years is to obtain a full pardon from the governor.  I have sent several letters for the past 3 years (Janet Keels- Clemency board) and submitted an application on 2004 along with a waiver but the application was denied in October 2005.  PLEASE I NEED HELP.  MY FAMILY IS SUFFERING.  I'M NOT A CRIMINAL.  I know there are many issues related to immigration right now and many, many cases, therefore, why should I be any special? My husband is an insurance adjuster and I’m a technology consultant.  We had our own business, house and were able to support our family.

 

I'm begging for my family.  They are with me because we are a family and we want to remain together as such but the conditions here in the Dominican Republic are unbearable.  My husband fears for his safety and the safety of the kids, there is a lot of criminal activity and they target foreigners.  Please help me.  Please grant me the full pardon.  I will do anything.  I will become a speaker on behalf of the state, I will initiate educational programs to help others.  I will provide community service for a lifetime; I will do whatever it takes to be able to be a valuable asset to my country.  We are not able to provide for our family and the kids are not able to attend school.

 

I know that your office does not offer legal advice or help, but what I’m asking for is within the power of your office.  I want to go back home.  I do love the US and I did not take it for granted.  My family and I worked very hard in order to obtain a stable future.  Please let me go back home.  Let us go back home.  Please grant me the full pardon.

 

Please do not disregard this e-mail.  My life depends on it.  Please take a minute to understand what we are going thur.

 

Thanks

September 6, 2006
 
 
Dear Gov. Bush,
 
Please be our honored guest for the Third Annual “Operation Cookie Lift” on Sunday, September 24, 2006 at St. Mark By The Sea Lutheran Church in Palm Coast, Florida.  Please find a PSA attached.
I thank you for your consideration in advance.
 
Rev. Tom Bingol, Pastor

OPERATION: COOKIE LIFT 2006

Sunday, September 24 – 8:45 a.m.

 


Palm Coast, FL – Everyone associates Girl Scouts with the annual sale of cookies, but for the past three years, St. Mark By The Sea Lutheran Church Girl Scout Troop #1116 in Palm Coast, have been selling cookies that are delivered half-way around the world.  It’s called “Operation: Cookie Lift” and the cookies are sent to our service men and women who are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.


 


The concept began three years ago with Troop Leaders Dominic & Janice DeZego, and Mark & Linda Klayman approached Rev. Tom Bingol with the idea.  “Our congregation is very committed to our service men and women as well as the Veterans in Flagler County.  We have held the Annual Four Chaplain’s Service and Armed Forces Recognition Sunday each year for the last eight years.  What made this project even more personal was the fact that some of our scouts had parents or relatives serving in Iraq,” says Dominic DeZego.  That first year, the Troop was able to send 198 boxes of Girl Scout cookies, and a special relationship was established between the church and the 506th Agile Expeditionary Group (AEG) Chapel in Kirkuk, Iraq. The Chapel runs a respite area for soldiers coming out of the field called the “Oasis” that welcomed the cookies as “A taste of home in the desert.”

 
Last year, the Troop increased its shipment to 315 boxes and partnered with local Veteran Support organizations, members of the Marine Corp League, American Legion and VFW and their respective Auxiliary units.  The girls wrote notes of encouragement on the boxes, and the cookies were boxed up for Iraq.  The troop also increased the number of troops it was connecting with by expanding distribution; maintaining its partnership with the 506th Agile Expeditionary Group Chapel in Kirkuk, but adding Chaplains at the US Embassy in Baghdad, the Wing Chaplain of the 376th AEW in Kyrgyzstan, and the 407th AEG in Tallil, Iraq. The Troop was also recognized in 2005 as the recipients of Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary Youth Activity Award. 
 
On Sunday, September 24, 2006, the St. Mark By The Sea Girl Scout Troop #1116 will be recognized for the Third Annual Operation Cookie Lift, at the 8:45 Worship Service.  The girls have more than doubled the number of cookies to 640 boxes, and two other troops are joining their efforts, one local and another in Volusia County.  
 
If you would like to be a part of “Operation Cookie Lift 2006” mark your calendar for Sunday, September 24 and join us at the 8:45 AM service.  If you would like to donate funds to offset shipping costs, you can make checks payable to “Girl Scouts” and place Operation Cookie Lift in the memo section.  We’re located at 303 Palm Coast Pkwy., N.E. in Palm Coast, next to the Sun Trust Bank.  Contact us for more information at 386/445-3420, or visit our website at www.stmarkbythesea.org.

     A few months ago I contacted your office about a new program called “Kids Thank a Veteran” at www.kidsthankavet.com. I would like to update you on the progress of the site and hope that your state can join the 10 states that are now participating. The primary purpose of this site is to have children say “Thank you for serving” when they see a veteran.  They can then register their first name and state on our national database.  We already have children from 20 states registered and this is only the beginning. The secondary purpose is to educate children on the many topics relating to our veterans.

 

      Within a couple of months we: 

*         Have ten state education associations join in to support the site in their schools (AZ, CN, MO, NV, NJ, OR, PA, SC, VA, WY) 

*         Have veteran’s organizations throughout the country spreading the word by including the site in their written material 

*         Are linked up to national veteran’s websites, such as the New Jersey Department of Military and Veteran’s Affairs and the Oregon Department of Veteran Affairs, to name just two.     

*         Are included in town websites, pediatric websites, etc.  

*         Received letters from eight Governors applauding the site for its merit. (Al, KY, LA, MD, MA, T, VA, WY) 

*         Were written up in three newspapers and featured on New Jersey Channel 12 News 

*         Received 100% positive feedback from veterans, educators and the public 

*         Will be featured on Veterans Radio, a national radio program

 

     The site is unique in that it does not sell anything and does not advertise – it just supports out veterans and teaches our children. During the next few months we are hoping to increase the number of state education associations that include the site in their curriculum, spread the word to more state organizations and sponsor a national or local poster contest.

 

     Please visit www.kidsthankavet.com.  I think you will agree that it is a worthwhile endeavor.  We are looking forward to having your state join in.

                                                             Thank you,

COMMENTS: Dear Governor Bush:

Sorry for the last minute invite; however after a recent dialogue about Florida Tax assessments, your name came front and center. Reference Florida Sportsman fishing forum for details.

But to the main point. I would like to invite you to Motorola, Plantation campus for a technology review. This is a regular  bi-annual presentation on 4 selected topics. Since it pertains to technology, and I just so happen to be presenting one of the segments tomorrow, you may have the entrepreneurial motivation to attend. 

Granted, I know this is extreme short notice. But so be it. You may also be so inclined to attend when you schedule may be better aligned. 

Sincerely yours,

Michael Baumstark

P.S. - I would include an attachment Agenda but this mechanism does not seem to support it. 

I may also be reached at M.Baumstark@Motorola.com. I will forward agenda if you provide an e-mail address.

Subject:	Referral for Allyson Hughes

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am writing this letter to you to strongly encourage you to select Allyson Hughes for the Sixth Circuit Judicial position for the judicial seat formerly occupied by Judge John Renke.  

 

I am a young lawyer in New Port Richey, Florida, and I practice primarily in the field of Elder Law.  However, when I initially came to New Port Richey, I was interested in practicing Family Law.  I was introduced to Ms. Hughes as a leader in the Family Law community here in the Bay Area.  Despite her impressive reputation, I found Ms. Hughes easy to converse with and willing to offer instruction.  I was immediately impressed with her capacity as a compassionate and extremely knowledgeable mentor.  In addition to allowing me to shadow her in the courtroom, she freely invited me into her office to learn office practices and procedures.  I believe her ability to provide instructions together with her command of the courtroom are valuable assets for a judge to possess. 

 

Shortly thereafter, I joined the Family Law Section of the West Pasco Bar Association and the first meeting was held at Ms. Hughes’ office.  I continued to be impressed by the level of knowledge and understanding with which she introduced the topics for discussion that day.  She also freely encouraged discussion and debate of new and existing laws and listened intently to everyone’s point of view, no matter how new a person, such as myself, was to the field of family law.  I believe Ms. Hughes’ ability to listen to her peers and apply the rules of law to specific circumstances will also be a valuable asset to the Sixth Circuit Judicial bench. 

 

Since my first year in practice, as my practice has evolved, I have continued to have contact with Ms. Hughes in both my practice and through the West Pasco Bar Association functions and meetings.  Ms. Hughes continues to consistently be well spoken and educated in the counsel she provides to her fellow attorneys which I have most recently observed in currently serving with her on the Professionalism Committee for the West Pasco Bar Association.

 

I truly believe that Ms. Hughes would make an amazing judge and would provide a great service to our community.

 

Very truly,

Subject:	PASCO COUNTY JUDICIAL NOMINATION

Dear Gov. Bush,

I am a member of the Pasco County Bar Association.  I would like to recommend the following individuals for appointment of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pasco County, Florida 

Hon. Shawn Crane is highly recommended among the attorneys who practice at the West Pasco County courthouse. 

I have personally appeared before Hon. Judge Shawn Crane, who substituted for a circuit judge in the Juvenile Dependency division for approximately a week.  He is very courteous to all who appeared before him, including clients.  He was thorough in his analysis and ruled accordingly.  Both defense counsels and assistant state attorneys held high opinions of him.  I would like to see Shawn Crane as one of your top appointment as a circuit judge.

Appointment Concerns:  As a practicing attorney in Pasco County, Florida, I have a great deal of concern of the potential appointment of Allyson Hughes, Esq.  Although she is very qualified as an attorney, however, her crusade against Hon. Judge Renke (and now seeking to fill his judicial position) left many practicing lawyers "uneasy".   There  are many attorneys  who  supported  to keep Judge Renke on the bench, and there are those who were against him.  Appointment of Allyson Hughes, Esquire, to replace Hon. Judge Renke may not be appropriate at this time.

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush
 
I am writing on behalf of myself, Shelia Coretta Washington. On the day of April 26, 1998 I was sentenced to be incarcerated for four years and 1 year probation following my release. During my sentence I obtained my General Education Degree and enrolled in P.C. support services (Business Software Application), which I too completed.
 
            I completed probation with no violations and have been a productive citizen since my re-entering society. It has been 3 years now since my release on March 6, 2003. Though I’ve done all that was asked of me, I am at a barrier. Because of this felony, charge, many of the jobs I am qualified for are overlooking me because the felony weighs heavier than my qualifications.
 
            My inner being longs for development to reach higher. I want so badly to follow the steps of my mother in the nursing field. Even my schooling is limited with choices because there are certain fields I am not able to enter into due to the mistakes I have made in my past.
 
            So I ask of you to take into consideration my age and the fact that I was a first time offender. I was sentenced as an adult-though I was a minor-therefore, the charge will always appear on my record.
 
            I can say the consequences have made me knowledgeable, I now truly understand. I have opened my eyes now-realizing and appreciating-who I am and where I want to go. At this point of my adulthood, I understand the importance of voting and having my rights which this felony has also stripped of me. I ask you to review my case so that you may take into consideration pardoning my felony charge from my records.
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Shelia Coretta Washington

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My daughter Emily Taylor entered the 2006 Florida Black History Essay this past winter and was honored to have her entry selected, winning second place.  Emily received tickets and a digital camera as part of her award package.
 
She sends her thanks and has very much enjoyed the camera and accessories.  
 
Not that the camera and tickets weren't enough, Emily did not receive any "official" notice that she was selected other than a call notifying us.  We understand past recipients (her cousin to be specific) who won 2nd place the year prior received a framed copy of a certificate.  
 
This certificate is a bigger cause of celebration for us as it will be able to be copied and added as part of her resume to apply for college.
 
We are very appreciative of the award and opportunity for Emily to participate in this contest.  Any "official" documentation which can be provided to add to her college resume would  be cherished.
 
As a side note, I am one of many who encourage you to follow your brother's footsteps and find your way to the White House.  I believe in your leadership and think that I share this ideology with many others.

Dear Governor Bush,
I write to alert you to one of the finest judicial candidates you will ever have the opportunity to interview.  Her name is Allyson Hughes.
Allyson was one of the first attorneys who welcomed me to the community when I moved to New Port Richey in 1993.  Since then she has been a mentor, counselor, friend and confidant.  Allyson is, without question, an attorney who emitomizes the Code of Professional Ethics in her professional life.  She was the one of the first attorneys in our area to become Board Certified and has provided enlightened leadership in the Famliy Law Bar throughout the state of Florida.
Allyson has volunteered many hours to our local bar education efforts also.  I recall that she organized a computer fair more than 10 years ago when attorneys in our area were just beginning to enter the computer age in their office practice.  The purpose of the fair was to educate practicioners as to the advantages of using computers in their law offices.  This was a very unselfish endeavor.
Allyson is very highly regarded by  her peers and is considered impeccable in manner and deed.  She will serve the community and the legal profession with dignity and judicial excellence.  Upon first meeting Allyson, one may percieve her to be aloof, but she is merely reserved.  This will be to her advantage as a Judge. She is very disciplined and has carried that discipline into the legal profession and into her hobby of training and showing magnificant horses throughout the country.
As you can tell, I recommed a strong candidate I am proud to call my friend to you and ask that you give her the consideration she so well deserves.
Thank you for your kind attention in reading this email.  I understand from people who know you that you prefer this form of communication.  If I may answer any questions or concerns, I shall be very pleased to do so.
Respectfully,

Re: Circuit Court Judge Appointment of Oscar Hotusing
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
As the court reporter for Enterprise Florida, Inc., in which you chair, I know how much you care about Florida’s future. That is why I believe you should choose Oscar Hotusing as the next Circuit Judge for the 18th Judicial Circuit in Brevard County.
 
I have worked in Brevard County for 21 years and I have known Oscar during that time. As a prosecutor, I have witnessed him fight for victims’ rights, and yet he is very fair and looks for justice. He is extremely dedicated and hard working.
 
I hope you choose Oscar Hotusing as our next Circuit Judge in Brevard County. He will not let you down nor disappoint you.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Lisa B. Johnston, RPR, CRR, CCP

Subject:	[*] Eglin's 46TW's Proposed move to Edwards CA

Linda Kirkland 

146 Old South Drive

Crestview FL  32536 

22 July 2006 

 

The Honorable Jeb Bush 
Office of the Governor 
The Capitol 
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

 

As a resident of North West Florida, I am very concerned about the latest talks of moving all or part of the 46 Test Wing (TW) to Edwards AFB, CA.  As I’m sure you already know, Eglin’s and the 46 TW’s missions have been studied, scrutinized and validated in both Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 1995 and BRAC 2005.  This latest proposed move to somehow circumvent the latest BRAC recommendations comes as a complete surprise and has many Eglin AFB employees and Florida residents very upset and concerned. 

 

Serving as the focal point for all Air Force conventional Weapon and Armament (W&A), Eglin AFB is responsible for the Research, Development, Acquisition, and Test & Evaluation (RDAT&E) of all air-delivered weapons. This is possible for three main reasons: The first being the synergies realized from the co-location of the Air Force Research Lab’s Munitions Directorate (Research), Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Weapon Systems Wings (Development/Acquisition), 46 TW (Development Test), and 53rd Wing (Operational Test) at Eglin AFB; the second being the irreplaceable, contiguous, and highly instrumented 724 sq miles of highly vegetated land ranges and over 120,000 sq miles of water ranges; and the third being state-of-the-art test facilities such as McKinley Climatic Laboratory, Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility, and the Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems.

 

Several BRAC 2005 recommendations have other geographically located W&A facilities realigning to Eglin AFB to further complement and strengthen Eglin as a full spectrum W&A RDAT&E Center. The impact of these BRAC recommendations will: increase W&A life cycle and mission related synergies/integration; increase efficiency; reduce operational costs; retain the required diversity of test environments; and facilitate multiple uses of equipment, facilities, ranges, and people.

 

As a resident of Florida and a taxpayer, it makes absolutely no sense to move all or part of the 46 TW to Edwards AFB. Even a partial move of only the flight test operations would greatly limit the ability of DoD to test weapons in the most challenging operational environments - vegetative/tropical environments. Also, it would have a significant impact on the synergies that currently exist at Eglin AFB starting with the elimination of the 53rd Wing’s ability to conduct Operational Testing and maintain its aircraft (shared w/46 TW).  If the truth be known it will cost the taxpayer a significant amount of money to establish only a subset of the capabilities that currently exist within the 46 TW at Eglin AFB with zero chance of every realizing a cost savings. Why is the Air Force trying to conduct its own mini-BRAC on Eglin AFB – It needs to stop now!

 

As governor of this state, I am asking for your help to ensure the entire 46 TW remains at Eglin AFB, FL to safeguard world class RDAT&E for future Air Armament Weapons, the livelihood of thousands of Florida residents, and the economy of Northwest Florida.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	Insurance costs and other concerns

Dear Governor,

    I’m sure you are inundated with similar correspondence but here it goes. I just recently received my new insurance quote for next year from State Farm Insurance Company. I was shocked to see that it has increased by a little over $800 for the year. I live in East Fort Myers in a small, older CBS home and I am not in a flood zone. I also have never submitted a claim.  I now of several families who have seen increases into the thousands of dollars per year. They are currently trying to sell and move out of Florida. I fortunately under-bought my house so I am able to absorb the blow of higher insurance and tax costs. However, many of the people in this area, and I’m sure many other areas, will not be able to handle the increased costs. With most of the insurance carriers gone from the state there is very little options for homeowners. As you well know, a lack of competition is not good for consumers. I also received my property tax estimate and because my wife and I bought our house here in Dec. of ’05 we paid a good amount over what the previous owners had and our taxes have more than tripled. I fear our fair State is headed for a real crisis. I know in this area there is a shortage of teachers, policemen, and firefighters. They simply cannot afford to live here with the combined cost of housing, insurance, property taxes, etc. 

     I know the State has experienced 8 hurricanes in the last two years but many of the insurance companies that pulled out of the state reaped profits for years, if not decades here in Florida during the lull years of few named storms. When thing were good they were here and when the times got tough they fled leaving many of the home owners in Florida in the lurch. We need people in the state government that is going to stand up for Florida residents. I don’t know who to vote for in the primaries or who I will vote for in the Governor’s election – the candidate choices are poor. There ads are more aimed at telling the public what the other candidates’ shortcomings and mistakes are than telling me and the other voters what they stand for and what they are going to do for the State and it’s people.

     I’m sad to say that our local government isn’t any better. The leaders in this area have left urban sprawl get way out of hand. I’m all for growth but lets have managed growth with a plan. Many of our roads here are overwhelmed. Citizens in Cape Coral had their wells run dry in the spring. Not to mention the water and sewer fiasco they are currently enduring. How can it cost $22,000 to run water and sewer pipes across 120’ of a persons property? This fee doesn’t include the $4,000 to $6,000 a plumber will charge to run and connect pipes from the house to the systems. If this doesn’t demonstrate a complete lack of governmental oversight I don’t know what does! Many people in Cape Coral are trying to sell their property and leave. How does an average family afford to do this? 

    I would welcome a personal reply but I know you will never personally read this or respond to it. I would also be willing to meet and discuss these matters and others if your schedule permits. I’m sure many citizens in this area would like to meet and discuss these matters with you. 

    I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush,

     I'm writing you in regards to my older brother Daniel M. McDavid, DC# 468241.  He is currently incarcerated in Santa Rosa Correctional Institution.  On June 15th 2006, my family and I met before you and the cabinet members for commutation of sentence.  During the meeting the original sentencing Judge ( John Parnham) left a phone  message stating that the sentence was unjust, and that Daniel should have only served 3 years and come home.  I don’t have much knowledge about clemency or how it works.  I’m sure its a long process and my family and I are being patient, but we feel we want to do more if we can. The large majority of our family members are older and may not be around much longer.  Unfortunately we already lost our father and he worked very hard trying to bring him home.   How long does this process take? If there is anything else the family and I can do for my brother Daniel, please let me know.  I want to thank you very much for your time. I know you are a busy man, so I hope I didn’t waste any of your time.

Hill was 23 at the time and there is evidence to suggest that Jackson masterminded the crime.  There is also evidence to suggest that Hill was under the influence of cocaine at the time of the crime. 

Clearly Hill is the worst of the worst and therefore the death penalty is appropriate for Clarence Edward Hill.  In view of the above mentioned information, I urge you to execute the son of a bitch.

As a fairly new resident to Florida (2+ years), I have
been very happy with Jeb Bush as governor.  He should
be the leader of FEMA!  Or better yet...president.  I
would vote for any person he would endorse for
governor.  

Is it possible to get a hint on who I should vote
for??  I am very confused by the commercials.  They
have been rather negative.  When I see a Crist
commercial I am sure to vote for him.  When I see a
Gallagher commercial, I want to vote for him.  

At this point, I will probably vote for Crist just
because he explains his side of the issues more
thoroughly!

Thank you for being the best governor I have ever had!
(Coming from Illinois, then Michigan)

Best wishes for your future.  Most likely I will vote
for anything you run for in the future!

September 4, 2006

 

 

President George W. Bush

White House

1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

Washington D.C.

 

Dear Mr. President,

 

Five years ago, I bought my first home in what was predominately a neighborhood of retired, former New Yorkers.  Last October, we were devastated by Hurricane Wilma, and many of our now older neighbors, decided it was time to leave.  To date, we still have approximately 30 homes, out of 274 that are in a major state of disrepair.  Many of the older residents sold their houses at below market, simply wanting to get out before another Hurricane season.

 

We have noticed that since then, there have been an unusual number of illegal immigrants moving into the neighborhood.  How do we know they are illegal, you may wonder?  They are proud of the fact that they are able to break the law and no one cares.  They have said that they feel safe here, as no one is going to look for them amongst our retirees. Yes, I am tired of the fact that they choose to not follow some basic rules and regulations on maintaining the standards of the neighborhood, but that is not why I am writing.  I am writing, because for the first time in my life, I am starting to feel ashamed of whom I am.  

 

I have always been proud to be an American, my Mother’s family migrated to this country many, many years ago, but on my Father’s side, I am a first generation American.  My father came to the United States, and made this country his home.  He insisted that we be proud to be Americans, teaching us American history and making sure that we climbed up to the top of the Statue of Liberty, crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, gazed at the wonders of the Great Lakes, Grand Canyon, and Gateway Arch of St. Louis, and paid our respects as we toured National Battle Grounds, viewed the USS Arizona, and the memorials in our nations capital.   He also managed to make sure that we learned Spanish, knew Cuban history, literature, culture, and were proud to be Cubans, as well.  

 

Prior to this new phenomenon in immigration, when new immigrants came to American, they sought to become part of America, while still retaining their immigrant identity.  They did not seek to re-write our National Anthem, in Spanish, they were proud to learn it in English.  Our neighborhood is changing, but not for the better.  I am tired of people insulting my country and choosing not to obey her laws.  I have struggled with making my feelings public, and calling for action.  My parents were ministers, and at one time pastored a church in Delano, California, where much of their congregation was made up of illegal immigrants, who worked in agriculture.  But I have to say, those people were at least trying to enter our melting pot, which is not what I see now.  

 

We called the Homeland Security department that deals with illegal immigrants,-1-866-347-2423, to report what was happening in our neighborhood.  The agent seemed to be irritated that we had so many names and addresses to report.  He questioned how we knew what we were saying, and that was the end of it – that was about a month ago, and nothing has happened.  Recently, in South Florida, there have been statements made, in the press, that the priority of the INS is dealing with criminals and terrorist.  Is not the act of entering this country illegally a crime?  Where does this stop?  What do we do?  

 

I am certain, that if the Immigration service investigated our neighborhood, they would be shocked at what they would find.  

 

There are several homes which we suspect, based on their association with other known illegal aliens, that they too are illegal, but we have not heard anything directly about them, but on the list we gave the INS, we feel certain there are illegal people in the house.  Some have told us themselves, or told us how they bought the house – when they first come on Visa, they get an international tax payer identification number, and then use this to set up what they need.  The laws being broken here are numerous.  People driving without a license, because you need to have proof of legal residency to get a drivers license, more than one family living in a single family home (this is city of Tamarac Code), people harboring other criminals, bringing senior citizens up to set up social security benefits, fraudulent marriages, fake social security cards (people have been sent letters from the social security office saying their names does not match the number), and oh so much more.    

 

Where does it stop?  Which laws are we going to enforce, and who decides?  These people are criminals, they have no regard for the law, and we as a people, as a government are telling them that it is okay to break our laws and not respect our nation.  We need help, at the very least, why not investigate for yourselves and see if there might be a problem here?  

 

Below is a list that we gave to the INS:  During the weekends or holidays there are always many more cars present.

As her hearing approached was told things had changed too much in Columbia and would not get papers, so married, complete with wedding and album.  Has bragged that some looser Immigration agent, drunk in a bar, fixed her papers.  I have never understood this part of the story.)

Subject:	National Veteran's appreciation website

 
 
 
     A few months ago I contacted your office about a new program called “Kids Thank a Veteran” at www.kidsthankavet.com. I would like to update you on the progress of the site and hope that your state can join the 10 states that are now participating. The primary purpose of this site is to have children say “Thank you for serving” when they see a veteran.  They can then register their first name and state on our national database.  We already have children from 20 states registered and this is only the beginning. The secondary purpose is to educate children on the many topics relating to our veterans.
 
      Within a couple of months we: 

*	Have ten state education associations join in to support the site in their schools (AZ, CN, MO, NV, NJ, OR, PA, SC, VA, WY)
*	Have veteran’s organizations throughout the country spreading the word by including the site in their written material
*	Are linked up to national veteran’s websites, such as the New Jersey Department of Military and Veteran’s Affairs and the Oregon Department of Veteran Affairs, to name just two.     
*	Are included in town websites, pediatric websites, etc.  
*	Received letters from eight Governors applauding the site for its merit. (Al, KY, LA, MD, MA, T, VA, WY)
*	Were written up in three newspapers and featured on New Jersey Channel 12 News
*	Received 100% positive feedback from veterans, educators and the public 
*	Will be featured on Veterans Radio, a national radio program

 
     The site is unique in that it does not sell anything and does not advertise – it just supports out veterans and teaches our children. During the next few months we are hoping to increase the number of state education associations that include the site in their curriculum, spread the word to more state organizations and sponsor a national or local poster contest.
 
     Please visit www.kidsthankavet.com.  I think you will agree that it is a worthwhile endeavor.  We are looking forward to having your state join in.
                                                             Thank you,

Governor Bush: I met you several years ago at a Republican Fund Raiser sponsored by Al Hoffman at his home in Walden Lake…. Subsequent to that event (you were elected Governor of Florida) I have been involved as a Director of Neighborly Care Network (Pinellas County) and facilitating distribution of Area Agency on Aging financial grants with the Florida Department of Elder Affairs. Albiet, I support Sherman Alexander’s evaluation of LeRoy Collins, and can assure you that Admiral Collins also has a vested interest in the welfare of senior citizens in Florida as well as nationally. Governor Bush, it seems to me that it’s time for senior politicians to stop “quibbling” over “how to get elected “and focus on the legacy our State and Federal Governments pass along to our children and grandchildren! I’ve known Leroy Collins for more than 30 years and he understands “legacy” better than any other Florida candidate for Senator Nelson’s seat. /s/ Gordon French

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Let me start by congratulating you for your service to the citizens of Florida while serving as Governor.

 

Having said that, I must admit that I am perplexed about how you can sit on the sidelines of the U.S. Senate race and not state a preference for one of the candidates.  If all goes according to the polls, the Republican Party in Florida will be represented by an undistinguished, weak, certain-to-lose candidate, for the November election -- Katherine Harris -- and the Democrat candidate will retain his seat in the Senate with effectively no opposition.  This situation will reflect poorly on your position as the leader of our party; and your commitment to give the citizens of Florida the kind of leadership they deserve in the Federal government.  I'm sure this has not escaped your consideration and I'm positive you have made an obvious decision to stay out of primary politics -- but why?  Florida Republicans need -- must have -- your leadership.  It is unfair and unlike you to remain on the sidelines while serving as the elected leader of our state.  You have a responsibility to make a choice, just like all the voters of Florida.

 

I have made a choice.  LeRoy Collins, Jr. is an obvious choice for Republicans but he faces an uphill battle against Harris,  a  candidate who you have said "can't win".  He has the experience and integrity that we need in the Senate.  I'm sure you have evaluated the other candidates, as I have.  Will McBride has no experience in business or the military and only scant experience in his chosen profession.  I sincerely doubt that he could stand up to Nelson in a debate.  No doubt McBride has potential but he is just too young and too inexperienced to be a viable candidate for the U.S. Senate.  The other candidate, Peter Monroe, completely lacks any attraction for voters as shown by his standing in the polls.  That brings me back to LeRoy Collins.  He needs your endorsement.  He has the experience and ability to take on Nelson.  And, as I'm sure you are aware, he has been endorsed by six leading Florida newspapers.  He has an unblemished record and a legacy from his father that he has followed throughout his service to Florida and the nation.  His pledge of one term in office would provide time for grooming the next Republican for the office and set the stage for Republican control for years to come.  He is Senatorial and he can win for the Republicans.  

 

Please don't make the mistake of remaining mute on the Senate race.  You are the Republican leader.  You have a responsibility to speak out and make your choice known.  I trust that would be LeRoy Collins, Jr.

 

Sincerely,

Sherman G. Alexander

State offering $250 million to help homeowners prepare for hurricanes 
-------------------- 

By Michael Peltier 
The Stuart News 

July 5, 2006 

TALLAHASSEE * Florida homeowners seeking to make their homes more 
hurricane proof soon will be allowed to tap into a $250 million pool of 
state money to assist their efforts. 

But the relief won't come overnight, and property owners must be willing 
to back up their requests with cold, hard cash. 

State officials plan to begin processing applications in August for a 
matching grant program that could put up to $5,000 in state money into 
the hands of qualified homeowners in the next five months. 

"It would be fair to say, given how the first phase works, our goal will 
be to have money in the hands of thousands of homeowners and contractors 
to begin making improvements before this hurricane season is over," said 
Tami Torres, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Financial 
Services, which is overseeing the program. 

In May, Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill that provides dollar-for-dollar 
matching grants of up to $5,000 in state funds for qualified property 
owners who want to strengthen their home's chances of surviving a storm. 
The program is part of a sweeping hurricane-assistance package that also 
provides aid to governments, mobile home owners and others. 

"As I've traveled around the region, I see a lot of people don't even 
know this is going on," said Rep. Ralph Poppell, R-Vero Beach. "There 
have been some people calling us about it, but not as many as we would 
have hoped. That will probably change." 

The state is in the process of instituting the $250 million program. The 
law requires state officials to set up a process that will require 
inspectors to pass drug screening and criminal background checks. 

Approved inspectors also must have some type of hurricane training or 
experience, Torres said. 

The program is limited to owners of single-family homes worth $500,000 
or less. The property must be a primary residence. Applications will be 
evaluated on a series of factors, including hurricane threat, what can 
be done to improve a structure's survivability and the 
cost-effectiveness of the improvements. 

"We're not talking about mobile homes or condos," Torres said. "This is 
really a single structure program." 

Applicants must first undergo an inspection to determine what, if any, 
improvements can fortify their homes. The state money must be used for 
hurricane-proofing endeavors including shutter installation, roof 
improvements and other work described in the law. 

Torres said homeowners living in hurricane-prone areas of the state 
would be given priority. 

"The statute was very clear that this is not an entitlement program or 
an income-based program," Torres said. "It is a program aimed at 
reducing hurricane damage in the state of Florida." 


-------------------- 
Key program points 

* Provides dollar-for-dollar match for hurricane improvements. Maximum 
grant is $5,000. 

* State legislators have set aside $250 million for program. 

* Application processing expected to begin in August. 

* Almost 2,000 applications filed since Web site went online two weeks 
ago.

Interested homeowners can get information, qualifying criteria and forms 
at www.mysafefloridahome.com. Homeowners also can call the Division of 
Financial Services hotline at 800-342-2762 for forms and additional 
information.

Dear Governor Bush:

I'm the President of the Spanish Club at Florida Gulf Coast University in 
Fort Myers. Every year, we have a dance to celebrate the Hispanic Heritage 
Month and to raise funds for our service learning project to the Dominican 
Republic. We have had great speakers in the past and the event has been a 
great success every year. This year, we are having our annual celebration at 
the University on October 13th starting at 7:00PM. We expect an attendance 
of about 200 people. The celebration will focus on the impact that the 
Hispanic Community has in Florida. 

We would like to ask you to be our keynote speaker for this celebration. We 
are well acquainted with your excellent work as a Governor and your great 
support to the Hispanic population in Florida. Your remarks as keynoter 
would set the tone perfectly for our celebration. 

Although our limited treasury does not permit payment of fees or expenses 
for speakers, we are hoping that your interest in the Hispanic community 
will be a sufficient incentive for you to be with us.

I look forward to a favorable reply, and just as soon as I receive it, I 
will send you complete details. Our celebration would take place at the 
Student Union Ballroom, at the University. Thank you. 
Sincerely,

Edison Vasquez

Subject:	lethal injection

Dear Governor Bush:

Florida's death penalty is in jeopardy and only you can fix it at this 
point. Right now, Clarence Hill's execution date is set for September 20th, 
2006, and with the 11th circuit just remanding the case back to the district 
court a couple days ago, it is highly unlikely Mr.Hill's execution will be 
carried out on this date. To my knowledge, the case on Hill's lethal 
injection claims can be expedited, but it's unlikely. If you reset Clarence 
Hill's execution date to around November, it will provide much more time for 
both the District Court and 11th Circuit to rule on Mr.Hill's lethal 
injection claims.

I fully support capital punishment in Florida. I would like to see Mr.Hill's 
execution carried out as soon as possible, but with a Sept. 20th execution 
date and his case having permission to challenge lethal injection....it's 
either postpone the execution another 2 months and give the courts time to 
settle the issue and expedite it and Hill's execution can be carried out.... 
or Mr.Hill will get a stay of execution permanently and Florida won't have 
any executions for quite possibly the next 2 years. I will be absolutely 
livid to see Florida's death penalty put on hold for 2 years. It's wrong. If 
you do the right thing and postpone Mr.Hill's execution 2 months, his case 
can be expedited through the courts and his execution will be carried out. 
Right now he's almost guaranteed a stay of execution because there's not 
enough time to expedite the challenge in 19 days to lethal injection in both 
district court and the 11th circuit.

Thank you

Mr. Bush:
 
I was born at Warren A.F.B., Cheyenne,Wy.  My father is 83 and a retired Air Force Colonel.  We moved across this country every 3 years and I have been in every state in the union.  When I was in junior high school I saw a film where Kruschev stated the United States would fall from within.
This prophecy has come to pass. 
 
Why should I learn to speak Spanish?  Why should I support - feed, cloth, and educate people who are in this country illegally and who are not even interested in learning to speak our language. I want this mass exodus into our country stopped.  All the veterans did not serve in the military to see a Mexican flag flying on U.S. soil.
 
Do whatever it takes - send them back to Mexico and let them begin the legal process of entering this country.  They are violating the laws and constitution of this country.

Please consider my letter of recommendation for your appointment of

Josephine is a very professional attorney and sincere humanitarian.  
She is involved in many legal and civic activities.  She is an asset 
to Southwest Florida because of her multi-cultural background and 
abilities with the Spanish language.   It is important for our growing 
Hispanic population to have representation in the courts, and she 
would be a wonderful addition because of her broad legal abilities and 
her conscientious nature.

Josephine Gagliardi is qualified to serve, and her appointment will be 
seen with favor by the Hispanic community.  Please contact us if we 
can answer any questions or provide additional information.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I received your response stating that you will not be able to schedule a meeting with me, however, I do hope that you will reconsider, and allow me to meet with you, since making you aware of the the laws relating to divorce and how it affects women of domestic violence would impact a magnitude of women.
Women who are abused , suffers permanent damage, should not be governed by the same laws as others who were not subjected to the same situation. Abusers should not be allowed to abuse others, and expect the same treatment, simply because the law is established at such.
Abused women with permanent damage from the abuser are at risk of loosing their jobs,are barely striving to make a living, some are not able to work as many hours as they need to to keep up with inflation, and yet have to be told that they have to abide
by the laws of divorce. I think this is an injustice, not only are women badly abused throughout the marriage at the hands to their husband, but face another form of abuse
when the law dictates the abused husband has equal rights.
Please reconsider, and allow me to discuss my situation with you at your earliest convenience. This should be a very brief meeting.
 
 
Sincerely,

I must apologize for taking so very long to write & tell you thank you from the bottom of my and my family's heart.  You see when Hurricane Ivan wiped everything my family had and my husband & I were living in a tent in our front yard - our daughter had to be moved in with friends - you made a telephone call to FEMA and a travel trailor appeared in our yard so that we could move in and bring our daughter home after many many weeks of being separated. I was transferred by mistake by the main switchboard operator and landed up talking with your secretary.  She was my guardian angel that day and took time from her busy schedule to talk to me, to cry with me - she just listened - then I can only imagine that it was her that told you about our telephone conversation. 
 
Ivan was only the beginning let's not forget the visit we received from Dennis & Katrina that brought water back into our home and made us to have to start all over again.  My Dad use to tell me that we were not to question why things happen just to remember that there is a reason for everything - granted I have often wondered what it was but I will say that we are better for the experience.  My husband & I are state certified Firefighters I - we volunteer in our local fire department - we teach CPR & 1st Aid and also volunteer with our county's Search & Rescue organization.  We feel our children learn by example and we try to show that everyone needs to put back into the society not just drain it dry.  
 
While Ivan was filling up our home my husband was trapped inside with our 12 year old foster son, I was volunteering at Emergency Management listening to my fire department trying to get to them not being able to complete that task - I will never forget walking into the 911 call center and listening to this event unravel.  I must say I will never be the same as I was prior to that moment.
 
People in today's society are fast to talk and say ugly things about others but few are there to tell the good things and to our family that is you.  It took us almost 21 months to get our home back together - well not counting just new sheet rock not finished in the laundry room - but close enough - we are 100% in our home - my home day care is back up and running - granted not where I was before Ivan but up nevertheless.
 
People often ask if there was one person in the world that you could meet who would it be - my answer is always the same - it is Governor Bush because you are my hero.  I thank God every day in my prayers for you and all that you have done for my family and so many others.  I wish that it was possible that you could see our home now that we have it completed but I understand that some things just can't be - that is with your busy work schedule and all the decisions that you have to make daily.  But the invitation to our home is always open for you.
 
I feel very honored to have you as my Governor and also very honored to have your brother as my President.  I truly believe that we are better people for having your family take the leading edge and guide us in the right way.  It is always so easy to be negative about what someone else is doing but not wanting to be bothered and help out.
 
I must admit that I learned many things along my way since Ivan, that "NO"  word that so many were fast to say - the lack of support from those people we thought were our friends that treated us like we had a disease and never stopped by or called to check on us - the insurance company cussing me and laughing at me and finally the attorney that I had to hired to take control and just give me a break - yes it is bad that I had to give him 33% but at some point in time I would have given him 100% just to prove that I was not going to give up.  Now that insurance company is not renewing us and no insurance company wants to write us a policy because my house was built in the 1950's and anything before 1977 is not insurable by most.  Well, let me say we have found one company that will but it is $2,700 a year to be made in one payment by the beginning of December - well I guess I have crossed many tall blockages during all of this what is one more.
 
I am sorry I have taken enough of your time but please know that we will always be eternally grateful to you, a busy Governor that took precious moments of his time to help us when no one else would and we so appreciate it - we are thankful for you.  God bless you in all that you every do.  Please tell your family thank you for sharing such a wonderful man with us.

Governor Bush,
Expressway authority is tainted from top to bottom. They are serving no purpose but to enrich themselves.  
Their philosophy is to hell with the taxpayers. Most of these people are appointed by you.  
We hope that you will clean up the mess in no time.
We do not think that taxpayers deserve to be served by these people.

Dear Gov. Bush,

 Greetings from the great State of Louisiana! My name is Bob Titus. I am an independent consultant in South Louisiana. I was recently contacted by a client who was seeking funding to construct a factory to manufacture panelized housing using a patented steel /concrete/insulation panel. 
 This method allows a builder to construct a home in half of the time required to construct a conventional wooden frame home. The finished product is designed to withstand hurricane-force winds; it is resistant to termites, fire, mold, mildew, and many other items that plague wooden houses! The panels are also capable of creating huge energy savings for the homeowner and subsiquently for the power grid! 
 This client is interested in raising $10 million dollars to fund this project. The factory would create new jobs and produce a premium product that would greatly assist in the rapid recovery of the destroyed homes left in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as, future development projects in both residential and commercial areas.
 The client would welcome a loan, partnership, or a combination of both!
 Thank you for your kind attention in this matter. I would appreciate a response to this message at your earliest convenience. The client is prepared to meet with any and all interested parties.
 Sincerely yours,

Titus Consultants
Bob Titus / Owner

Re: Josephine Gagliardi (Governor’s Appointment to County Court)

Dear Governor Bush

I am writing to recommend Josephine Gagliardi for the appointment to become a County Court judge for Lee County.  

I have practiced before many judges over the last 25 years, both in government service and private practice. I believe that Ms. Gagliardi has the qualities which will make her appointment one of which  you will be particularly proud. I have worked extensively with her over the past five years. She clearly has the intelligence and knowledge of the law which a judge requires. She has a broad range of experience which also more than qualifies her. However, I believe that what sets her apart is her dedication to her work and her clients, and her desire above all to always do the right thing. Should she become a judge, those who appear before her, regardless of whether they agree with her ruling, will leave court believing that they have received a fair hearing from a compassionate and thoughtful judge.  

 The citizens of Lee County will be well-served should you see fit to appoint Ms. Gagliardi to this position. 

 Thank you for your consideration.

Hello,
 I'm including my past email in this email so it will hopefully refresh your memory of my case. applied for a full pardon in November of  2005. In January I received a letter from you informing me of the fact that my application for the waiver of the requirements had been approved and signed. This was on January 31st, 2006. As of today I have not been contacted by anyone. I have made several calls to your department and have not been able to get any answers. I know that there are allot of applicants. I would just like to know where I am in the process. My time is running out. Its been 8 months since that letter.
Please advise me on what I am to look forward too, or who I can contact to have my questions answered.
Please take the time to read my last email to you that is attached to this email.
Your Help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank You

Hello,
  I'm sorry for taking up your valuable time. However, I didn't know
what else to do. I will try to keep my email short and to the point. Ten
years ago I made a mistake and got involved with the wrong crowd. I'm
not going to make any excuses. What I did was wrong and I know it, and a
regret it. I was arrested and charged with felony theft. I pled Nolo
Contender, was ordered to probation, and to make restitution. Which I
have done..I have not been in trouble with the Law before then or after.
Judification was withheld. Now 10 years latter I am working for
Escambia County as Environmental Enforcement Officer. I have been
working here for a little over a year and a half. I have been promoted
from Environmental officer I to a II and now my boss would like to
promote me to a Level III. Here is the problem He cant since I pled Nolo
since level III is a sworn Law enforcement position. IN fact our whole
department will be going to sworn officers. I was told by FDLE that the
only way to get my certificate activated is to get a Full Pardon. The
problem I am facing is that the process takes 18 to 24 months. I would
be out of a job and a career that I very much love. I have the support
of my department head and department Chief. They knew about my past. All
I am asking is if their is any way that process can be shorten. I  would
be for ever great full. If you can please advise me on my options. I
understand that this might not be  life and death issue but in a way it
is for me. All my hopes and dreams are tide to this position. Its all I
ever wanted to do.
Thank you for taking the time to read my e-mail.
I hope that there is something you can do to help me.
Your response would be greatly appreciated.

Hello, my name is Karen Dennis and I am the proud parent of two Hispanic children, one who attends Trinity Catholic School and the other at Lincoln High School here in Tallahassee.

 

As part of Hispanic Heritage Month, I would like to invite the Governor to come to Trinity Catholic School, possibly sometime during the month of September to read to a class of 28 3rd grade students a Hispanic themed book and talk about Hispanic Heritage Month.  Last year I was able to have Mayor John Marks come to Trinity Catholic School during Black History Month and read a book to a class of 2nd graders about Rosa Parks.  It was great to see the students listen, ask questions, and be ever so curious.  It gives me great joy to enrich their lives with knowledge.

 

I would welcome First Lady Columba Bush as well if she were able to attend.

Dear Governor Bush, 

This letter is to voice my support and recommendation for the appointment of John M. Harris, to the next Circuit Court Judge, for the 18th Judicial Circuit. 

As a Brevard County resident and member of the business community , in my opinion there is not a better qualified candidate than Mr. Harris for this position. I have known the candidate for ten years and know him to be a fair, impartial and extremely credible human being. His record as a jurist and County Court Judge speaks for itself and his experience has certainly qualified him to be a successful Circuit Judge. 

Thank you for your consideration of this outstanding citizen.

Good morning, my name is Trevor Rudolph contacting you from The Performance Institute. This e-mail is to invite Governor Jeb Bush to deliver a keynote address at the 2007 State Performance Management Summit. I have attached the conference agenda for you to review at your convenience. This conference will highlight the latest best practices in state management innovations. Topics covered will include financial management, leadership development, and process improvement to name a few. The following are the event and keynote details:

 

February 27, 2007 8:30-9:30am 

Keynote Address: Reinvent State Government with Performance Management Systems  

In a time where state governments are expected to do more with less, the need for action is vital. Governments are expected to function efficiently and effectively while conveying positive results to the taxpayer. To ensure that your department or agency is operating at an optimal level, performance management must be a priority for government managers and employees. Effective performance management can help your government move toward a successful future. 

 

The event will be held at the following location. If the Governor decides to accept this speaking opportunity, we will cover hotel, travel and conference related expenses. Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 703-894-0481.

Subject:	Walk for Peace: 9/16/06 in Sanford

Dear Governor Bush,


I imagine there are very few of us on the planet today not deeply concerned with the violence happening all around us, in all parts of the world including on our very own streets. You know the feeling of powerlessness in the air; it seems no matter what we do, things are just getting worse. When can we ever imagine our America in this state?

I do, however, feel a significant shift underfoot. Take this idea Congressman Dennis Kucinich came to us with not long ago about a cabinet level U.S. Department of Peace. Although a new Secretary of Peace may be years from the naming, the fire has been lit, an alternative to this bleak present is imaginable. I can sense  the deep impact of such an eminently sensible, perfectly concrete message.


Existing programs, communication skills, mediation and conflict resolution are already being practiced and refined. Just think of how a federal Department of Peace, formally charged, might validate and expedite the process for nonviolent solutions to domestic and international conflict. The proposal even includes establishing a fourth service academy on a level with West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy. Training young leaders for peace instead of war. Imagine!


Are you aware that two bills are presently before each house of Congress to establish such a Department? I feel very strongly that if our fellow citizens knew, they wouldn't lose any time  joining us to urge our representatives to sign on.


I AM ASKING YOU TODAY TO JOIN US ON SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2006 FOR A WALK FOR PEACE.
This walk is being held both in honor of Gandhi's first walk for peace 100 years ago in South Africa and to support the Department of Peace campaign. There are currently over 80 cities in 32 states hosting walks in this nationwide endeavor. You can get the full picture at http://www.thepeacealliance.org/content/view/178/147/

We will be meeting at 9 AM on the 16th next month in downtown Sanford at the Visitor's Center on the corner of Palmetto & FIrst. We'll walk down First and up Park past City Hall and Seminole Courthouse to Veterans Memorial Park on the lake. After a short address at the park, we'll continue eastward along Riverwalk and circle up Mellonville to First past the Seminole County offices, then back to the municipal parking lot. It's just over a mile and should take under three hours including our time at the park. As it's still summer, we are urging all participants to bring a bottle of water with them and a hat. Toilets are available at Mellon Park along the RIverwalk. 


This walk is not envisioned as a protest, an anti-war march or rally. We are for peace and the Department of Peace, specifically; on that day we will not be against anything. This is an opportunity to model peace in all we do  --to truly be that momentous change we're so hungry for. As such, we will have T-shirts, signs, banners, etc. promoting only Peace. In this way, we will be walking for positive change, for healing, and for those things that genuinely unite us all and promote mutual understanding.


I am attaching our information sheet. For more info, contact me at 407 323-9809 or email me here. It would be great to share these few hours together for this one vital issue that so touches all our lives.  

If you are not available on the 16th, I'd greatly appreciate your sponsoring me as I walk; your donation will be your own way of being included in this local movement towards peace. Make your check out to The Peace Alliance. You can send it to me at: 715 South Myrtle Avenue, Sanford, FL 32771. Your support will make a difference.


Thanks so much for taking the time to walk with me here. One more thing: can you think of five friends who should know too, and who might want to join us? They don't have to be from Sanford: ours is the only walk for peace taking place in these parts. Would you please take another moment now to pass this invite on to them?


Peace,
Jim Rucquoi

Subject:	Son Case

Dear Governor Bush,

My name is Willie A. Wood. We have one main thing in common, we both love our children. Thus, the reason I am writing you today.

Recently, my son received a life sentence in prison for Sexual Battery Under 12 Years of Age. I am writing you, because he did not commit this crime. He was wrongly accused by my son's ex-girlfriend, a mother , who had a serious frug addiction. Naturally, I am standing behind the viewpoint that my son is innocent.

After three hours of court, the judge just gave me son a life sentence, without any concrete evidence, just that person testimony, which was questionable.

My attorney has written a brief to argue my son 's case. I am quite certain that we will have a new trial coming in the near future, but that could take as much as four years.

My son has a son, who is seven years old. This is where we have the main thing in common.I don't want my son to spend the next four year in prison for something he didn't't do. My grandson, should not have to grow up without his father-especially, since his father is innocent.

May I please have the priviledge of an appointment with you, or your representative, to discuss the matter. Would you please fax a response to this request to 386-345-2776 or E-mail me back to willieharriett@bellsouth.net.

We both love our children and want only  what is just for them. I am sure you can understand where I stand on this.

Thank you for your corporation.

Subject:	Appointment of Charlotte County District 5 Commissioner: We highly recommend Donald C. Coppola
Attachments:	Dear Governor Bush.doc




August 30, 2006

Dear Governor Bush,

Our family unanimously recommends Don Coppola to fill the vacant District 5
commissioner seat in Charlotte County.

Susan and Charles first met Don Coppola at his place of business in 1983.
From the first, they saw he had a remarkable understanding of county issues
and solutions. They remember when your father was running for president,
there were photos of your mother’s trip to Charlotte County in his shop. Don
Coppola was and is proud to be a Republican and has promoted the Republican
party at his place of business.

We would give him an A for responsibility, knowledge, and compassion for the
residents of Charlotte County.

As for responsibility, he served 8 years in the US Navy. Some of these years
were during wartime. He has been successful in his personal and business
endeavors. Besides his successful business, and investments in Charlotte
County, he showed fiscal responsibility as a Charlotte County Commissioner
from 1996 to 2000.

As for knowledge. Don Coppola knows Charlotte County backwards and forwards.
This is partially because he has lived here since the 1970s and because he
cares about Charlotte County. He knows what he is talking about and shares
his information with others.

Don Coppola’s rapport with people sometimes is overshadowed by his knowledge
and sense of responsibility. However one great sign of his rapport with
voters, is reflected in the fact that during his office there was a better
ratio of Republicans to Democrats in District 5 than there is now.

Don Coppola has the responsibility, knowledge, and compassion to make a
great commissioner for District 5 and the county, as he has in the past. We
hope you take this information into consideration when you are making your
choice.

We would be glad to answer any other questions you might have. Please call
us at (941) 286-1183 for further information. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Susan and Charles Kovacs

Subject:	CHILD SUPPORT

Dear Governor Bush,    I have a divorce order that includes child support in Florida. After the divorce my ex-husband moved to Texas. After much difficulty in receiving child support from him, I opened a case with Child Support Enforcement here in Florida in 2002. I filled out the appropriate paperwork, and the child support office forwarded this paperwork to the state of Texas for enforcement. Sometime later I requested that FL contact TX to request enforcement as it had been quite some time since I had received support. FL contacted TX for me and was told that they never received the paperwork. FL immed resent the paperwork to TX. As I have always received my support sporadically, I do not know if TX ever contacted my ex-husband. Some months later, I again requested FL contact TX for enforcement. Again, FL was told that TX did not have the paperwork on my case. FL then faxed AND mailed the paperwork to TX. Texas did nothing to enforce. As of this Friday, Sept. 1, it will have been 9 months since I have seen any support payments.  A month ago I emailed the Office of the Attorney General in Texas. I did not receive a response. Two weeks ago I emailed the Office of the Governor of Texas. I received a copy of the email I sent and a copy of the notice that was sent to the Office of the Attorney General. So far, no action. I contacted my local child support office today (Aug. 30). They had contacted Texas yesterday to request enforcement. Fl CSE was then told by the TX child Support office that they had closed my case in May 06 as they did not receive the paperwork they requested in March. This is when the paperwork was faxed and mailed to them for the second time. The worker in FL was talking with the Texas call center. The worker looked up the case and found in the notes that they had indeed received the paperwork in March. Needless  to say I am very distressed over this! The FL CSE has done their job and I have done mine. Texas is terribly lacking. I have always taken care of my child to be sure he did not do without do to a deadbeat dad. I am married at this point in time and am very lucky to have a husband who helps take care of my child as if he was his own; but during the years I was a single mother I never took any thing from the state as I was fully capable of working and did in fact work two jobs for quite some time to take care of my child as it was my responsibility, not the State of Florida's. I again emailed the Governor of Texas this evening and hopefully will get some satisfaction soon. This said, I hope that your office will contact the office of the Governor in Texas to inquire for me what is happening. In the meantime, the Child Support office here  is resending the paperwork in hopes that Texas may do something this time. I thank you for your time and help in this matter. Sincerely,  Theresa M. Foreman

 Governor Bush:

As part of Congress.org's virtual hearing on immigration reform, I wanted 
to offer my own views. I support border security plus a path to earned 
citizenship. We need to take the same approach to immigration as was done 
in response to the flooding in New Orleans last year. Namely, reinforce 
the border first to prevent unauthorized individuals from entering the 
country, and then remove those unauthorized individuals who have committed 
ANY transgression of federal, state, or local laws. There are plenty of 
hard working, law-abiding individuals who would be welcome members of our 
society. Once the acute emergency is dealt with, we can have a discussion 
in our country on how to integrate the remaining folks into our society.

Mr. Bush,
 
I find this action very offending to the people which put you in the Governors Office to serve the people of Florida.  With actions pending to ward off the manner in which people are put to death in this State is it to much for you to consider waiting until that action has reached their decision before you sign death warrants for Mr. Hill?  What difference can a day or weeks make before murder is performed on someone?  Maybe God would in the meantime take matters in his hands and let Mr. Hill die a normal death and no one would have blood on their hands.  This is a very sincere plea for a mans life that I do not even know, but feel that he deserves one last action on your part to let him live until all else fails to keep him alive.

Gov. Bush

My name is Donald Kennedy Jr., and I have a warrant out for my arrest for 
violation of probation in the State of Florida. I have been considered a 
fugitive since 2003, and I want to clear this matter up and so I can move on 
with my life and not have to worry about being separated from my wife and 
children again.

I was living in Florida when I failed to return a rental vehicle. I know it 
was a dumb thing to do and I wish that I had not made that kind of decision. 
I went to court for my offence, and agreed to be placed on probation for 24 
months and pay restitution. I went to every meeting and made every payment 
for about 17 or 18 months and then I lost my job. Within a few weeks my life 
became a nightmare.

My wife tried to commit suicide, and my son back in Arkansas was calling me 
everyday crying for me to come home. I got my wife out of the mental help 
facility in Stuart FL, and after we talked about it, I made the decision to 
leave.  I know it was a bad choice to make, but I chose to take what little 
bit of cash I had left and my wife and I caught a bus back to Arkansas. At 
the time I was thinking about saving my family instead of considering my own 
legal situation.

I had discussed transferring my probation to Arkansas with my probation 
officer before all of this happened, but she had told me that I would have 
to have a job first. I tried to get a job over the phone, but it didn’t work 
out too good for me. Without being able to actually show up for interviews, 
I couldn’t find a job, so there was no hope for me to leave Florida legally.

I have contacted a couple of lawyers to try and get some help, but they want 
far more money to take the case than I can afford, and they said that I 
would have to turn myself in before they could help me out. My family can 
not afford to be without me, and if I were to turn myself in it would leave 
my wife and our two kids without anywhere to live, and destroy our family. I 
cry every night about this whole situation, and I have no idea how to handle 
my problem without any money, and without anyone to help me out. Other than 
this thing, I have never had any serious trouble with the law, and if I 
could, I would fix this mess. My family and I live life on a day to basis, 
and coming up with enough money to resolve this issue is just not possible.

I have pretty much lost any hope that I will ever be able to live a normal 
life, and I know that one day I will be picked up by the law and sent to 
Florida to face a jail sentence. This letter is written as a last resort, 
and I’m hopeful that there is a way I can get a pardon from the State of 
Florida. If you can help me at all please contact me.

Sincerely
Donald Kennedy Jr.

           I am writing to you on behalf of my brother,Robert E.Smith, Doc# 994615. He is an inmate at the Sumpter County Forestry camp.  We are asking for your help in commuting
the rest of his sentence to probation.  My brother is remorseful for his crime, a crime whose only victim was himself and his families. Due to a momentary lack of judgement fueled by alcohol intoxication he mistakenly thought vigilantism was his only recourse in regaining his stolen property.  He realizes what a stupid mistake that was but at the time he was more worried about his ability to run his business and provide for his family.  He helped someone out by giving them a job and a place to live and they repaid him by stealing all his computers he needs to run his sign business.  
       Our family has suffered many tradgedies and injustices.  Robert has missed his sister's funeral, the birth of his first grandchild and countless other family occasions due to one serious lapse in judgement.  We have lost of mother, father and sister due to long debilitating diseases.  The biggest injustice of all is that our oldest brother was murdered in 1974.  He left behind two small children and a devastated family.  The two men who brutally murdered my brother and his girlfriend only served a two year sentence due to a plea bargain.  Yet Robert sits in prison for 10 years for a victimless crime because a judge decided to sentence him way above the guidelines of his conviction.  Where was this judge when  the child molesters 
whom roam our streets were sentenced?

I would like you to serve as a keynote speaker in this conference, referencing your experiences and successes with price transparency in Florida.

Subject:	Interim Sheriff for Alachua County, Florida

August 30, 2006

RE: Joseph M. "Buddy" Crevasse III

Dear Govenor Bush:

It is my understanding that an "interim sheriff" will be needed to take the helm of the Alachua County Sheriffs's office upon the effective date of the resignation of Sheriff Oelrich until the installment of the new elected sheriff after the election is completed. I am a resident of Alachua County and have been so since 1964. I am retired from the Gainesville Police Department with 33 years of service and currently am an Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at Santa Fe Community College. 

I have known Joseph M. "Buddy" Crevasse III for some 35 years of his 37 years with the Alachua County Sheriff's Office and I ask that you consider appointing him as the leader of that organization for the interim period. It is important to stabilize the organization with someone who knows how to immediately take the helm and a person with the integrity to do the right thing for the benefit of those employed and the citizens of the county, as a whole. Buddy Crevasse has worked in the community for many years both inside the sheriff's office in numerous command positions and in community outreach, whether serving on the board of the Salvation Army or cooking for the Rotary Foundation Fryers. I have been associated with Buddy both on the job and in the community and you will not find a finer human being anywhere. 

Buddy started with ACSO in February of 1967, as a marine patrol deputy and over the years,worked and commanded communications, warrants, baliff, civil section, uniform patrol, civil/court security, and technical services bureau.
During the mid 1980's he completed his BA degree from the University of Florida while working, raising a family and progressing though the ranks to the satisfaction of all.  I met Buddy in 1969 when I began with the Gainesville Police Department and have never had occasion to regret eith our friendship nor anyy activity we have worked on over the years. 

I am proud to ask that you consider placing Buddy as the Sheriff for Alachua County. I appreciate your consideration and I remain available for further inquiry if additional questions need answered or if I can assist you in any way.

Sincerely,

I speak for the entire Bernhardt Family when I say thank you. As another year goes by my family is getting everything ready for our trip to Florida’s Missing Children’s Day. His 6th year will be here on the day of the ceremony, my little sister and I will be taking up the rose. We made it through my Grandma, Aunts, and Uncles. I always hoped that I would never have to take the rose to his picture. I know that September 11th is such a horrible day, but it’s nice to see you and your staff take the time not only to remember Zach but all the other children who are lost on such a day. Since the terrorist attacks 5 years ago it seems that the one day a year we have to get his face out on TV. has been taken but you will not let that stop you from doing whatever it takes to help all the families in their time of need. A lot has changed since Zach has disappeared, two of his cousins have children, two have babies on the way three have gotten married one was in a bad accident last year at Universal Studios while he was working and died twice, but I’m glad to say the Lord was with my family on that day he is alive and doing very well, and last eight of his cousins have graduated High School. He has missed so much and been missed so much. My daughter will be 5 in January and knows a stranger took him and knows him only by pictures. I guess all I would like to say is thank you for what you have done for our children since you have been in office, I hope your work will continue after the new election takes place, but I do wish you could stay in office. Please try not to let our next Governor and the one after that and all the other’s after that forget these children. Children are our priceless future and should be treated in such a way- priceless. And always remember they are lost but never forgotten. Your time in office has meant so much to Zach’s entire family and for that may god bless you and yours, and keep you safe from harm.

Subject:	Hurricane preparedness / upcoming trip

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I have been watching Florida’s efforts to protect it citizens through a culture of preparedness.  During this effort the government has appropriated $250,000,000 in state funds to protect homes under $500,000 in appraised value.  At the same time, the insurance industry is giving the Floridians the two step. One by increasing the premiums on wind insurance and Two dropping the people that need the insurance most of all, leaving the States Insurance safety net holding the bag.

 

My company StormBlok has an answer to how to protect these peoples homes and contents as well as to get insurance companies to step to the plate and fulfill their responsibilities in regard to offering insurance to the lowest common denomination, Mobile home owners and single story home owners. We have patented and validated a new thinking product that offers total home protection, not just the windows and doors but the entire structure.  The product reduces the wind load on the structure by a minimum of 60% (University of Massachusetts), creates an impact barrier that surpasses Project Impact standards and is affordable.

 

The Company has recently moved its status as a New York based Company to a Florida based Company. 

 

Along with my Board of Directors, I will be in Florida September 6th through the 10th and would like the honor of educating you on this revolutionary new thinking product and also to see how we might work with Florida Universities, the Economic Development Council and the States Insurance Council to help Florida not only have a culture of Preparedness but actually be totally prepared.

 

We will alter our schedule in any way to accommodate your availability.   I can be reached at (585) 749-8943 or by e-mail at either of the following addresses.  Pwiegel@rochester.rr.ocm or pwiegel@extradev.com.

 

Thank you for your consideration in this matter and I am sure that once you see how StormBlok approached this significant problem you will feel that the 30 minutes you spent with us is time very well spent.

Subject:	[*] Florida Politics

Dear Gov. Bush,

 

I am contacting you because of my frustrations with your office. Recently in Miami there is a commercial showing you  standing and supporting  a political candidate named Frank Bolanos. Are you aware of the personal agenda and irresponsibility of this individual? In Miami we have a large Cuban population. They may be many in number but they are still part of the American system. There is a book in our community libraries  titled “Vamos A Cuba”. Well Frank Bolanos and the community Cubans feel it does not portray Cuba as it should and have voted to remove it off the shelves of our schools. There are a lot of books that leave room for discussion but they are not removed off of the American shelves. Frank Boalnos, acting on pressure from the Cuban community, voted to remove this book, and when a Judge ruled the vote was illegal, he then voted to take $250,000 of our school money to fight this action. He states he is protecting our children. WHAT ARE WE BEING PROTECTED FROM ??? Our schools are in need of physical repair, we do not have enough schools for our children, our teachers are underpaid, there are gangs and not enough supplies and he wants to spend $250,000 of our precious money to fight a Cuban children’s book cause. Can you please explain this to me and can you please explain why you are supporting this individual? Yes he is Cuban and yes he is a Republican but your responsibility is to see that our school system is well funded and our American way is protected from censorship. My advice to you is to pull you name off of this individua’ls campaign otherwise you have tarnished your reputation of education support.

 

Also I beg you to help us with insurance reform. My homeowner/windstorm insurance has increased from $465 to $4,000. We soon will not be able to live in the State of Florida. There are blue tarps on a majority of the homes in our area because we can not get our roofs repaired, and there is a hurricane moving in our direction.  Where is our government and how are you helping us? 

 

Our politicians were voted to support the people who elected them, not support special interest groups or causes. 

 

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush, 

 

I am writing on behalf of Josephine Gagliardi, a finalist for appointment as a Lee County Court judge. As private tutor and family friend, I have known Josie for several years and can vouch for her tireless work ethic, honesty, integrity, tenacity, and belief in fairness. 

As an educator, I wish that more parents were like Josie in the wise guidance she gives to her twin sons in teaching them to be accountable for their personal actions. In truth, I think she’s had to act as a caring judge for the 14 years she’s been a mother. One of Josie’s sons, Dennis, has multiple disabilities, and I have seen Josie be not only his tireless advocate and devout mother, but also his personal instructor on self-discipline and accountability. 

If Josie presides over a case, I know that she will deal with each party in a fair manner. I am confident in saying this because, despite her sons’ vast difference in abilities, Josie shows them both the individual affection, attention, and supportive love they each need. 

As a voter, a teacher, and as a citizen, I ask you to please appoint Josephine Gagliardi to the bench. I am certain that she will serve Lee County well, with every attention to detail and fairness.

We would like to know how to contact the committee that is studying Florida property tax reform.  Please send us the name of the chairperson, a mailing address, e-mail and/or phone number so we may contact them.  We are Florida property owners but live out of state and have suffered huge tax increases due to a 65 % increase in our appraised property value in just the last three years while others have their property values capped.
 
We (as owners of a non-capped property) feel that we are essentially carrying the load for tax revenue increases while not being able to have a voice through government or elections locally.  Taxation without representation??  Feels like it.  Meanwhile we watch our small town of Ponce Inlet, where we purchased  a condo in 2003 and enjoy in the winter, rake in huge revenue increases, build unnecessary $7 million dollar town halls and spend more and more...because they can.  
 
Please provide us with a way for our voice to be heard.  We are also pursuing relief through the Volusia County property appraiser.
 
Thanking you in advance.

In previous years, we have received letters from officials such as the Governor, Mayor, FBI and many more welcoming our members and guests, commending our organization, encouraging our work, and supporting our efforts and vision.  We have always included these letters in the banquet program, which has been welcomed by our community members.  We would appreciate it if a letter of this nature from your office can be sent to our office in time to be included in this year’s banquet program.

I’ll be glad to provide you with a template if necessary.  

We hope that someone from your office will be able to join us at future events.

The pattern of government corruption and laziness is well know here in our District is it possible it extends to the highest levels even in Tallahassee? Please prove me wrong.
 
I fully understand that your office is not a law enforcement agency but, I am merely asking that your office recommend or direct the FDLE to start an investigation and handle it outside of District 1. I know that is within your power.
 
In case you need the information the commissioner of FDLE is Gerald M. Bailey and his email is geraldbailey@fdle.state.fl.us.

Governor Bush:  I am writing on behalf of Glenn Martin who has been submitted to you by our local JNC for the position of Circuit Court Judge.   I have known Mr. Martin all of his career as a prosecutor.  Since I have been in criminal law for 34 years I have had numerous opportunities to observe him in court and out.  He has always been fair in his dealings with the defense and he comes to court prepared.  He is well respected by adversaries and judges alike.  He has the reputation as a lawyer with integrity who can try a complex case effectively.  He would make a judge who will listen and rule without prejudice or favoritism. He would make an excellent choice as one of our judges here in the Sixth Judicial Circuit.

Dear Governor Bush, 
The School District of Hillsborough County in conjunction with Hillsborough Education Foundation  will be awarding  the 16th Annual Business Partnership Awards at a breakfast on Tuesday, October 31, 2006 at the Hyatt Regency in Tampa. The awards program recognizes and honors all the businesses who have supported public schools in Hillsborough County in the past school year. Typically, this popular event attracts between 700 and 800 leaders in business, community and education as well as the media. 

We would be honored if you would consider joining us to serve as keynote speaker for this special event to help recognize those who have helped promote public education. The teachers, administrators and community along with our board of directors would be thrilled if you would participate in the awards program and help recognize the importance of business and community working together to support students and teachers in the third largest school district in the state.
 
Some of last  year's winners include Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union, TECO Energy, Inc, Washington Mutual, as well as smaller businesses and organizations  like Sparky's Oil Company and The Tampa Downtown Partnership.  

I have attached a brochure detailing the event, as well as an event program from last year along with our board of directors list.
We hope we can convince you to join us. 
Sincerely, 

Mary-Helen Keen

Subject:	FLOOD INSURANCE, DESTN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

Dear Governor Bush:

Mr. Robert Guidara has sent numerous e-mails to your office during the last two weeks to apprise you of the serious situation faced by your constituents here on the Gulf Coast who are unable to obtain flood insurance. He then spoke to one of your aides who directed Mr. Guidara to request a telephone conference with you. Shortly thereafter he received a form letter from Tara Wainwright, your Director of Scheduling, which said you did not have lime to meet with Mr. Guidara. Of course, the fact is that Mr. Guidara never requested a meeting with you. He requested a telephone call — as was suggested by one of your aides. Your refusal to even talk with Mr. Guidara indicates a disheartening indifference to the problem facing the (mostly Republican) constituents of this area.

I have voted a straight Republican ticket ever since I voted for Barry Goldwater. I have voted for you, for your brother, and for your father. I voted Republican because I believed the Republican Party had more compassion and concern for the American people than did the opposition party. Your indifference to the flood insurance problem faced by the people on the Gulf Coast gives me reason to question the wisdom of what I have done.

There is a Citizen’s Group meeting at 9:00 a.m. on September13 at the Destin Chamber of Commerce. Congressman Boyd and Senator Nelson have already decided to have representatives attend the meeting. It is amazing to me that our Democratic Congressman and our Democratic Senator will be represented at the meeting while there has been no word from our Republican Governor. I am writing to request you have a representative attend the meeting.

Yours truly,

James D. Brodie

Subject:	Disappointed

Dear Governor Bush:

I sent numerous emails to your office these past two weeks in attempt to apprise you of the very serious situation faced by many of your constituents here on the gulf coast. I spoke with one of your aides at length, and she directed me to request a telephone conference with you. I did that via email as instructed. A few days later, someone from your office called my home and asked my wife for our address as she was told that it was a scheduling procedure requirement.

Today, to my dismay, I received a form letter in the mail from Tara Wainwright, your Director of Scheduling, which said that you did not have time to meet with me. I did not ask for a face-to-face meeting. I asked for a telephone call conversation. All I wanted was 10 minutes of your time to discuss options and ideas relating to our inability to purchase flood insurance this year. There are thousands of homeowners here in the CBRA zone-restricted Destin area who have suddenly become totally vulnerable -- and virtually stranded -- due to an unfortunate series of unforeseen circumstances, and unanticipated regulatory consequences.

A citizen's group has been formed recently in our community. We have our second meeting scheduled on September 13th at 11 a.m. at the Destin Chamber of Commerce. We have been told that representatives from both Senator Nelson's and Congressman Boyd's offices will be present to discuss possible remedies and to help facilitate a scheduled conference call with congressman Boyd's Washington DC office, who as you may know, has proposed federal legislation relative to this issue. Our local newspaper will also have a reporter attending the meeting. Perhaps someone from your office could be present as well. While we may not represent a large voting block, we are counting assistance and the show of concern from all our elected officials.

Please let me know as soon as possible if it would be if a representative from your administration will be able to attend our upcoming meeting. If not, I would ask you again to please reserve a few minutes for a brief telephone conversation with me sometime before September 13th. 

Thank you, in advance, for your personal attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Robert Guidara

Subject:	[*] death warrant

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:

Florida loves you as Governor. There is no doubt in my mind that if you 
weren't prohibited from seeking another term, you would be re-elected. You 
have done so much for our state within the past 8 years. It's ashame we have 
to see you go, but I want you to know that you do have the support of many 
fellow Floridians on your side.

One issue that comes to mind as it regards your status as Governor is you 
have proven yourself to be a tough on crime Governor who doesn't put up with 
no crap. You have shown support for the states use of the death penalty, 
which is good, and you continue to fight to protect the safety of our 
citizens.

With all do respect though, there is one issue that has been bothering me, 
and thats the failure to sign death warrants and announce execution dates 
for certain inmates. You should start by signing Norman Parker's death 
warrant. This man is a three time convicted killer. He is a convicted 
cop-killer as well. he was sentenced to Life in prison for the murder of a 
law enforcement officer in 1967. Mr.Parker escaped from the Florida Dept of 
Corrections in 1978 and murdered Julio Chavez during an illegal drug 
transaction. Just one month later Norman Parker commited another murder in 
Washington D.C in August of 1978. Mr.Bush, this man is extremely dangerous. 
He has escaped custody before, and he is on death row because he committed 
several murders. He's a three time convicted killer. I'm asking you to sign 
this man's death warrant in particular because all of his LEGAL APPEALS are 
now exhausted. You are probably well aware of Florida's appeals system which 
allow inmates to file successive postconviction motions. Right now, Parker 
has an appeal of denial (by the trial court) for DNA testing. Granting DNA 
testing isn't gonna prove a thing to Mr.Parker. There is overwhelming 
evidence of his guilt, and even if this murder would to be out of the 
picture, Parker was convicted of two separate murders, one of which was a 
police officer.

Stop letting justice be delayed Mr.Bush. Sign Mr.Parker's death warrant 
before you leave office.

Dear Gov Bush:  
 
Elizabeth "Beth" Foster was my daughter's best friend when she was kidnapped, beaten, and murdered by George Taylor in 1992 while she attended the University of Florida.  I have been unable to find out if this man was ever extradicted from WI to FL (after a series of legal mis-steps) or the disposition/status of this case.  While searching the internet, I found that you had continued attempts to get him back to FL for trial.  Our family would be most grateful if you can tell us what has happened.  
 
Beth was a wonderful girl and we miss her every day.  It changed my daughter's life forever.  As a mother, I would just like to know this monster is behind bars somewhere and will be tried for Beth's murder at some point.  I could not comprehend the WI judge's nit-picking and failure to cooperate on such a heinous crime. Thank you very much.

Good afternoon to you Governor Jeb Bush, My name is Carlos Joel Montas, and I attend Florida State University. On April 21 of 2005, you appointed me to serve on the Americans with disabilities act working group board. I want to express what a wonderful opportunity this appointment has given me to understand how the policy process works.

As I am sure you know, there is still a lot of work to be done, but I feel like we are on the right track. I some day would like to be more involved in formulating policies that will have positive effects on the disabled population across the State. In what ways do you think I can continue to serve people with disabilities in the policy development area?I  hope to be able to continue to serve because that is where my passion is. I am a social worker so it excites me when I see people changing for the better.My thoughts and prayers are with you and   the rest of the State as we all prepare for the arrival of this storm.

I am writing in regard to the position of the Judge of Compensation Claims in District M-South (Fort Myers) which is being vacated by the Honorable Daniel F. Turnbull.  I have practiced in this area for more than 20 years and am concerned with the apparent consideration being given to Kathy Sturgis for this position.  I have been familiar with Ms. Sturgis in the position of Mediator in District M-South since she assumed the position and do not believe that she represents the best candidate for this position.

 

Without going into substantial detail, I have found Ms. Sturgis to be only marginally effective as a mediator.  I know from extensive conversation with most of the bar practicing in District M that Ms. Sturgis is not held in any particular regard, but few active practitioners are willing to vocalize this out of concern for retribution in the event Ms. Sturgis ultimately assume the position of JCC.

 

Although I have number of lesser concerns regarding Ms. Sturgis’ qualifications for this position, my primary hesitation involves her lack of experience as a Workers' Compensation practitioner.  Participating in mandatory State Mediations involving Workers' Compensation claims lends virtually no transferrable skills into the position of Judge.  I am aware that there are number of experienced practitioners who are interested in the position of the Judge of Compensation Claims and I feel would be more than qualified to assume this role than Ms. Sturgis.  I would respectfully recommend that these other candidates be given greater consideration due to their documented dedication to this area of practice.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your convenience.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Presently you are considering an appointment to the Lee County Court bench to replace Judge Ed Volz who you elevated to the Circuit Court.  I was a prosecutor assigned to Judge Volz's court room from January to December 2002.  I think it will be a challenge to succeed Judge Volz in this position; however, you have an excellent candidate in Magistrate Gagliardi.
 
Over the past year until her appointment as a Magistrate, I litigated opposite Magistrate Gagliardi in a very contested juvenile dependency case.  Despite our clients' extremely opposing positions, Magistrate Gagliardi was always very fair, professional, and treated my clients and I with courtesy and respect.  Although she was a very zealous advocate for her client, Magistrate Gagliardi always maintained excellent temperament and demeanor.
 
Since her appointment, I've appeared before Magistrate Gagliardi in a juvenile court proceeding.  She was extremely prepared for the hearing and very poised.  She treated everyone in the hearing room with dignity.  Magistrate Gagliardi was very careful to ensure all the procedural and statutory requirements were followed and the integrity of the system maintained.
 
I am familiar with Magistrate Gagliardi's work history and her commitment to public service, both the legal community and community at large.  I believe her experience and dedication exemplify her qualifications for this position.
 
In addition to being qualified for County Court Judge, your appointment of Magistrate Gagliardi will contribute to your legacy of ensuring that the bench mirrors the community that it serves.  I appreciate your taking all of these factors into consideration, including public comment when making these very important appointments.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing about the makeup of the Sustainable Emerald Coast Committee. With the exception of Ross Hamilton there seems to be a stark absence of people with clear environmental concerns. I find that alarming. 

A balance between environmental concerns, the business community, development, education and politics is important. It does not appear that this committee has struck that balance with regard to individuals that might be experts on our wonderful natural resources. How can we hope to sustain, in a responsible healthy fashion, what we have in this wonderful part of the state if we don’t fully utilize experts on the habitats, flora and fauna that comprise the area?

Dear Mr. Governor,

 

I just wanted to send a quick introduction.  My name is Chad Pupillo, and I am the Chief Executive Officer for US Biometry Incorporated.  We are a newly formed company that is in the early stages of development.  We formed to develop solutions to the ever increasing issues of personal identification and authentication, security of information that passes between machine and networks, and secure access to, as well as storage of, critical data.  As technology rapidly becomes more advanced, particularly in the areas of wireless machine to network, the threat to a person or company’s most prized possession – information – becomes a critical concern.

 

Our long-term focus is to use this technology as the foundation for development of more advanced offerings, specific to how people interact universally to all technology that surrounds them.  For example, a user that possesses a core universal identification and security solution could streamline their interactions between mobile smartphones, intelligent display systems, and advanced information networks, in a safe and effective manner.

 

I wanted to express my thanks to you for the hard work that you have invested in the Florida economy.  When my colleagues and I were in the selection phase for the location of our corporate headquarters, we began to realize that the Tampa area would be a great fit.  Technologically, it has a robust support structure with both the Tampa Bay Technology Forum as well as the Technology Corridor.  We are delighted with our progress, particularly due to the assistance of various Florida-based organizations.

 

In closing, I would be very interested in any advice you may be able to provide to us regarding venture capital relationships we may be able to leverage.  I am building as fast as possible a list of candidates that I would like to partner with, and in particular, Florida-based relationships willing to reinvest in the continued development of its economy.  I thank you in advance for any assistance that you may be able to provide to us, and for your support.

To Whom It May Concern -
 It is my understanding that the FBI and the Justice Department are 
aware of certain practices by the City Council of Cape Coral, Florida 
concerning the Utilities Expansion and the City's audit.  We recently 
received  a Notice of Availablility with yet more charges that we, as 
homeowners, are to pay to the City of Cape Coral for  the Capital 
Expansion Fees. 
It states that just for us to have sewer connection, the fee is 
$1738.00, a security deposit with varying rates for $100.00, water meter 
installation for $310.00, septic abandonment (county inspection fees) 
for $40.00, a lien fee per lien if Capital Expansion Fees are financed - 
$10.000 PLUS obtaining permits for : Sewer Connection, Water Connection, 
Septic Abandonment and Irrigation connection.
Now, on top of the $11,000.00+ that we have to pay for the sewer(with 
part of the monies going for road repairs(thought that was in our 
taxes), we have these fees which will probably be $3,000.00 more.  Of 
course the City offered, just for this latest bunch of charges, a 6 year 
loan, after a down payment of 15%, with an interest rate equal to Prime 
Rate plus 2%.  If we, as homeowners, finance, the the property owner is 
*_required _*to sign a  _*voluntary  *_lien form, being again charged 
for  recording the lien and paying to have it notarized. Since when is 
"*_required"  _*a _*voluntary *_action?
After all  of this is done and we have followed every step correctly, 
had all of the necessary inspections paid and done, we, as homeowners, 
have to contact the Lee County Health Department concerning the septic 
tank abandonment .  The septic tank has to be crushed or collapsed and 
then we have to fill this crushed or collapsed tank with clean material, 
grade and stake the area and call for another inspection.  Answer me 
this, - how do you fill a crushed septic tank with clean material when 
it is CRUSHED???????????
I certainly pray that the Justice Department and FBI are investigating 
this matter thoroughly because the City of Cape Coral is causing a 
tremendous amount of uproar and discontent among it's citizens.  There 
are a lot of people moving out of Cape Coral because they can no longer 
afford to live here.  There are families here that have lived here for 
40 years plus and are sickened by the corruption and illegal practices .

Sincerely,

Martha D. Mentzer

Subject:	[*] ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

I received the following email from a friend and decided to past it on to you because... while coming home last evening from a friends house in Palm City, Florida... I noticed when I looked to the right as we passed over the Florida Turnpike... a billboard written TOTALLY in Spanish.  Now, if everyone who receives this message would forward it onto Governor Bush, - jeb.bush@myflorida.com  - (as well as their friends and family)  maybe, just maybe, Governor Bush would listen to the message his brother conveyed in an address regarding immigration.  "If you live in American, you need to become an American citizen, work, pay taxes and SPEAK THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!!!" 

Enough is enough.  Stop just passing messages like this around the Internet.  Pass it on to those who can make a difference. (Hopefully they will listen.)  I just forwarded this to Govern Bush!  Please do the same.   jeb.bush@myflorida.com
 
If you do not live in Florida, please forward this message onto your Governor.  Take action...speak out - in ENGLISH!
 
Below is the following message I received this a.m.  (It got me fired up again from last evening.)  The message may be old news...but that Billboard surely wasn't !.
Mary Edison - An English Speaking, Hardworking, Tax Paying, American Citizen living in the State of Florida that is soon to be lost to the Spanish Language!  
  _____  

It is Time for America to Speak UP 
 

I am sorry but after hearing they want to sing the National Anthem in Spanish - enough is enough.
 
Nowhere did they sing it in Italian, Polish, Irish (Celtic), German or any other language because of immigration. 
 
It was written by Francis Scott Key and should be sung word for word the way it was written. 
 
The news broadcasts even gave the translation - not even close! 
 
Sorry if this offends anyone 
but this is MY COUNTRY.  
IF IT IS YOUR COUNTRY, SPEAK UP 
 
~   Please pass this along. ~

I am not against immigration 
just come through like everyone else. 
Get a sponsor; 
have a place to lay your head; 
have a job; 
pay your taxes, 
live by the rules, 
AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE 
as all other immigrants 
have in the past 
 
--- and GOD BLESS AMERICA!

PART OF THE PROBLEM

Think about this: 
If you don't want to forward this 
for fear of offending someone .....
YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM !!!

Will we still be the Country of choice and will we still be America 
if we continue to make the changes forced on us by the peoples from other countries that came to live in America because this is the 
Country of Choice???

Think about it!

All we have to say is, when will they do something about MY RIGHTS?
I celebrate Christmas, but because 
it isn't celebrated by everyone 
We can no longer say, 
"Merry Christmas."
Now it has to be, 
"Season's Greetings."

It's not Christmas vacation; 
..... It's Winter Break. 
Isn't it amazing how 
this winter break ALWAYS occurs 
over the Christmas holiday?

We've gone so far the other way, 
bent over backwards to not offend 
that now I am being offended. 
But it seems that no one has a problem with that. 
 
This says it all! 
 
This is an editorial 
written by an American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper. 
 
He did quite a job; didn't he? 
Read on, please!

IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, 
MUST ADAPT.
 
I am tired of this nation worrying
about whether we are offending 
some individuals or their culture. 
 
Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced 
a surge in patriotism 
by the majority of Americans. 
 
However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled 
when the "politically correct" 
crowd began complaining
about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others.

I am not against immigration, 
nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life 
by coming to America. 
 
Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. 
 
However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. 
 
This idea of America being a multi cultural community 
has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. 
 
As Americans, we have 
our own culture, 
our own society, 
our own language 
and our own lifestyle. 
 
This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials,
and victories 
by millions of men and women 
who have sought freedom.

We speak ENGLISH ..... 
not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,
Russian, or any other language. 
 
Therefore, if you wish 
to become part of our society, 
then learn the language!

"In God We Trust" 
is our national motto. 
This is not just some Christian,
Right wing, political slogan. 
 
We adopted this motto because Christian men and women
..... on Christian principles ..... 
Founded this nation ..... 
And this is clearly documented. 
It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. 
 
If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world 
as your new home .....
because God is part of our culture.

If Stars and Stripes offend you, 
or you don't like Uncle Sam, 
then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. 
 
We are happy with our culture 
and have no desire to change, 
and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. 
This is OUR COUNTRY, 
our land, and our lifestyle. 
 
Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so! 
 
But once you are done Complaining, Whining, and Griping 
About our flag...... 
Our pledge ..... 
Our national motto ....
or our way of life .
 
I highly encourage you 
to take advantage of one other 
Great American Freedom .....

THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.

It is Time for America to Speak up 
 
If you agree -- pass this along; 
 
if you don't agree -- delete it!

Is there any program available for individuals who have started their 
own small business, are MBE certified, and want to devote their 
efforts to building the business.  I am working full time but can not 
make much headway in bidding on solitations due to the fact I work 60+ 
hours/week.  If I had the time I could due my due diligence and 
properly, timely bid on solicitations.  I know there are some states

Good evening Governor Bush.
Samuel Wickham Ferguson was born at Healthpark Hospital in Fort Myers on
April 27, 2006. He seemed like a healthy & "normal" little guy. He is our
fifth & last child. He has a brother & three sisters who were very excited
to welcome him. I n all our joy, we found out one week later that he has
Trisomy 21. 
Since then I have found myself learning an immense amount. A nursing
student at Healthpark Hospital referred me to 
SW FL PODS Angels for support & guidance. I have become an advocate for
Downs Syndrome for my son Samuel.
To promote awareness, we have planned a Buddy Walk on October 14, 2006. I
have attached a file on our walk & sponsorship. I am hoping perhaps you can
join my family as well as so many others' on the morning of October 14,
2006. If you are committed to another obligation already perhaps you can
make other Floridians aware of our plight. October is 
Down Syndrome awareness month & your support is greatly apprecciated.
On behalf of Samuel & the rest of my family I thank you for your time &
consideration.


God Bless,
Tracy Ferguson,

Governor Bush,
I am writing to you to show my support for Glenn Martin who is being considered for one of two circuit court judge positions.  He has been a friend of mine since our youth and has had an amazing journey to where he is today.  In addition to the years of undercover police work and putting himself through lawschool, he has always gone the extra mile to fulfill his dream of serving the people and community he lives in.  I have the priviledge of knowing him as a person.  A man of honor and integrity beyond question.   A devoted family man who has always been there for them and has always been a very involved leader in his church and community.  Some may know him only as Assistant State Attorney and any one who does can tell you that he is fully committed to that job as well.  His track record and knowledge of the law speaks for itself and his tenacity and puposeful attitude prove that he knows how to get the job done.  His job as you know is to prosecute those who have broken the law.  I don't have to tell you that when you are surrounded by that element of society day in and day out, you are bound to loose some of the joy of life.  It doesn't mean that you become unreasonable and hardheaded,  it means that you take your decision making very seriously.  This is what he does.
Please let him show the people of Florida that a determined lifelong Florida resident can dream and live the dream.
 
My best wishes to you
and thank you for you time.

will attempt to break the Guinness World Record(TM) in reading for the "Most
People Reading Aloud Simultaneously in Multiple Locations".  According to
Guinness World Records(TM), the record is 155,528.  On Thursday, September
28, between 11 & 11:30 a.m. EST, middle school students will attempt to
break that record via a live public broadcast and Webcast from Disney-MGM
Studios.  During the program, I will lead a statewide read aloud using an
excerpt from the book "Peter and the Starcatchers" written by Dave Barry and
Ridley Pearson who both joined me on Friday to announce the event.  To learn

HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOLS REWARDED WITH $157.6 MILLION

Also on Friday, I announced $157.6 million in funding to 1,799 Florida
schools in recognition of academic achievement and improvement during the

funding first rewarded in 1999.  Since 1999, Florida has awarded more
than$852.7 million in school recognition funding.  I marked the announcement
by presenting checks to Webb Middle School in Tampa and Sadler Elementary in
Orlando.  Both schools received recognition funds for academic success.  To

“With the possible exception of Ray Reiser, I would wager that most every lawyer who has encountered Jack Thompson has considered filing a Bar Complaint or defamation action against him….If all Florida lawyers begin acting like Thompson – with the Bar’s tacit blessing – then our profession is in serious trouble.”

Re:  Further Response to Larry Kellogg’s August 11, 2006, Filing with The Bar Re 2006-71,140 

 

Dear Ms. Tuma:

 

This week I was in trial in the Miami-Dade Courthouse.  I was able to concentrate on the task at hand because a) I was not engaged in an adulterous affair with a client, unlike some lawyers, b) I was not contacting law enforcement officials to get them to drop investigations of me and my firm, unlike some other lawyers, and c) I was not busily facilitating the distribution of pornography to children, unlike some other lawyers.

 

In light of Mr. Kellogg’s above words to The Florida Bar about what “most every lawyer” thinks of me, which are found in a letter in which he claims my words are spiteful, I thought I would share with him but more importantly with you and others, the following emailed comments from the folks I represented in Court this week:

Jack, 

 

I also wanted to express my gratitude to you as well.  As I briefly stated in the car on the way home from the courthouse, I wish I would have been more myself this week.  I am afraid I did not make a very good first impression with all of this on my mind.  I was distracted to say the least.  You however, made a wonderful impression not only on me, but on my family as well.  We were grateful that you were there in so many different ways.  Thank you for everything that you did.  Although Im sure that you would say you didn’t do anything, you did more that you think, and we all appreciate it.  Hopefully our paths will cross in the again in the future.  

 

Thanks again, 

 

JC

 

In 1992, the American Civil Liberties Union named me and my client, Lt. Col. Oliver North, its two “Censors of the Year.”   This is an organization that officially holds that the possession of child pornography is protected by the First Amendment.  The ACLU would appreciate Beasley Broadcast Group’s and its lawyers’ view that pornography should be distributed to children as well.

 

Mr. Kellogg is right—there are certain lawyers who do not care for me, in addition to the scofflawyers at Tew Cardenas who are in a state of panic now because of me.  These opponents tend to be moral midgets when it comes to protecting children, and I understand where they are coming from.  I also know where they are going.

 

On the other hand, I have clients, as indicated by the above, who appreciate me as a lawyer.  I also got a standing ovation at Miami-Dade Community College fairly recently when I was introduced as “the local attorney who got Howard Stern off the air.”  The class was filled with African American women.  They get it.  Lawyers at Tew Cardenas, Blank Rome, and Leventhal, Senter & Lerman don’t get what is offensive about the following aired comment, that was aired by Stern on Beasley’s station in Ft. Myers:

 

“Ever bang any famous nigger chicks?  What do they smell like?  Watermelons?”

 

Here’s a suggestion for Mr. Kellogg:  Tell your wife and your children about the above quotation and ask them if they think that it should be aired on the public airwaves to children.  Then ask them what they think of someone who got that hurtful garbage off the air.  My guess is that they would think that person did a good thing.  If not, then your kids have a future at Tew Cardenas. 

 

Mr. Kellogg, I may have a number of lawyers who don’t care for me, and I’m proud of that, because, Mr. Kellogg, you’re one of them, and your campaign to destroy me tells me I’ve been on the right track for quite sometime.

 

I count your and your unethical firm’s and the ACLU’s hate for me a badge of honor.

 

With enemies like you, I can sleep at night.  The friends I have, who are more than you know, are more than sufficient for me until I get to go home and meet Him for eternity.

 

In Christ, Jack Thompson

Dear Gov. Bush:

This letter is to reiterate our need for support in
carrying out this noble venture. The Karma Korner
(karmakorner.com) has agreed to allow us to use their
venue. Perhaps some sponsorship could be sent their
way. We also seek sponsorship in the following areas:
an all-inclusive travel package for our largely
nationally based audience.  This includes housing/
hotels, ground transportation, catering and also other
intrepid sponsors. 

Dear Governor, this will be an event of national and
international coverage. 

The theme brings to focus the contemporary strife of
our Prisoner of War and those Missing in Action. We
also have international acts from The UK headlining.
Wouldn't it be grand for our President and Mr Blair of
Britain to know that the 18-40 year old American
demographic understands current political issues? 

We also have a band from Colombia whose nation is
presently fighting terrorist- based groups with the
help of the United States. Think of the potential
media exposure for this musical expression of freedom.


Sir, we need a state approved representation for
POW/MIA organization. 

We hope the Governor utilizes this stellar opportunity
to lay down any potential future political endeavors. 

The date of the event is November 25 and 26, 2006.
Urgency is of utmost importance. 

I thank you for your time and cooperation.

Dear Governor Bush,
This letter is in regard to Burnham Institute for Medical Research building “research” and “treatment centers” in Orlando.  I am hoping that you did your homework to ensure that this “medical research” company does not test on animals.  Animal experimentation is an inherently violent and unethical practice that I do not feel anyone’s tax dollars should support.  Funding for research into health and ecological effects should be redirected into the use of epidemiological, clinical, in vitro and computer modeling studies instead of laboratory experiments on animals.  
Not only is using animals for research an inhumane practice, but studies have also shown that research carried out for “medical purposes” tends to be irrelevant to human health.  In addition, diseases that are induced in laboratory animals are NEVER identical to those that occur naturally in human beings.  Finally, the fact that the species most often used in laboratory experiments are chosen largely for non-scientific reasons, such as cost and ease of handling, casts further doubt on the validity of this research.  
Every creature, great and small, has a right to a peaceful life.
Sincerely,
Michelle Boening

Good evening,
    The state of Florida recently (Tuesday) held a press conference to award "Succeed Florida, Workforce Development Grants, that were applied for during the summer.  It took nearly one year to write the grant (I had never done a grant request before) and low and behold, we were granted the highest financial award to a high school allowed by the state, $68,219.
    The following broadcast was filmed by CBS at East Lake High School this morning and aired this afternoon.  The news station asked for the interview last week, before the grant award was made public.  The references to PLTW did not make the cut but the overall point is one that we all are making on a national basis.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
         The time has come to act on solutions to the currrent insurance crisis in the state. If it takes to call a special session of the Legislature, please do it now. Every day that goes by the insurance industry is getting away with astronomical increases in the premiums, or simply allowed to stop underwriting homeowners or commercial policies for windstorm damage while allowing to continue to to do business in more lucrative type of policies. It is cherry picking and it is not right !
 
           I have been a resident and homeowner in the South Florida area for the last 40 some years, and recently retired  from the military after a tour of duty in Iraq, and many years of proud service as one of your subordinates in the Florida National Guard.  The rate increases over the last two years have more than double my payments and I have already been informed by my current carrier (Balboa Insurance from California) that my policy will not be renewed as of next year. 
 
        As a senior citizen , with a fixed income and still having to make mortgage payments it is coming to the point that I will have to decide whether I can put food in the table , or try to sell the house and move out of Florida, or find a job so I can pay for the outrageous rates. 
 
        Please, do something now ! Call the Legislature to session and keep them there until they come out with a logical and equitable solution to this crisis.

Dear Governor Bush:
I have emailed you many times concerning the welfare of Florida's child, something that is dear to your heart, but today I'm emailing about our school East Milton Elementary School.  Our school consists of some of the poorest children in Santa Rosa County but it is a school that goes beyond in the teaching of these children.  The administration and staff of our school is among the best in the state.  The love and concern for these children is evident from the Principal to the Cafeteria Staff, the children of East Milton Elementary are valued, they are our future leaders.
My reason for this email, other than to brag about our school, is to invite you to be our guest during National School Lunch Week (October 9th - 13th).  Come and see how well our teachers are implementing your educational programs, see the genuine love and respect that these students have for their teachers.  See the success and pride in the eyes of the East Milton Roadrunners.
I know and appreciate how busy you are and the tremendous burden that you carry for all of Florida but if there is anyway you can attend, it would be the highlight in the lives of these children.
Three of these children are my special needs children adopted out of Florida's system, children that were severely abused by their birth parents and dearly treasured by my husband and myself.  They are successful due to the love and dedication of their teachers at East Milton Elementary.
Come and see us.  Enjoy a lunch and be blessed.
Respectfully yours,

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Daniel Gemal and I am the Managing Editor of Florida Gun News. We are a rapidly growing magazine with distribution throughout Central and Northern Florida. We have a monthly distribution of 10,000 copies distributed through gun dealers, shooting ranges, gun shows, pawn shops, sporting goods stores and other gun friendly businesses. We write reviews of products, comment on the current political issues that are gun related and publish other general information of interest to shooters in Florida. Our mission statement is as follows: Florida Gun News is published to support, promote and educate on responsible and ethical gun ownership, whether it be for defensive, competition or hunting purposes. 
 
For our September issue (available to readers on August 15th) I conducted an interview with Wayne LaPierre, the Executive Vice President of the NRA and I have already received numerous comments from our readers about how they would like to see more interviews with the people who are instrumental in preserving our Second Amendment rights.
 
For our November Issue (available in our distribution outlets October 15th), we are doing an election special. We have sent surveys to each of the candidates standing for seats in the upcoming elections asking their stance on gun related issues. The results of those surveys will be published in that issue. It would also be an honor to include an interview with you to discuss the way that you have worked tirelessly (and continue to work) to preserve our Second Amendment rights and our rich hunting heritage during your tenure as Governor of Florida.
 
I would make myself available at your convenience to conduct the interview and would send an advance copy of my questions to your office.
 
Thank you for your time reading this email. I look forward to hearing from you soon to schedule a date and time for the interview.

Gov.  Bush,
There are numerous problems at the Hillsborough County Expressway Authority.
 
Please remove Robert Clark, Jr. from the board.  His un-ethical conduct is noted in the following article:  http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGBV33X1ARE.html
 
Secondly, disolve the organization.
They are currently promoting a loop road through multiple counties in the Tampa Bay Area that is not needed.  Their proposal would cause sprawl and conflict with your efforts to ensure local governments are fiscally sound.  Further, it would conflict with efforts to implement transit options in the future.
 
Please help us in Hillsborough County.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

We hope you will consider Glenn Martin for Circuit Court Judge in the Florida Supreme Court for the following reasons:  

 

Ø      He is a man of honesty and integrity, first and foremost.

 

Ø      He is qualified for this position, with a lifetime commitment to law enforcement.

 

Ø      22 years as an assistant state attorney and over 65 jury trials.

 

Ø      A family man with a positive attitude, impeccable character and deep conviction.

 

We have known Glenn & his family for over 30 years and are confident he will make one of the best judges our state has ever had!

 

Sincerely,

Larry & Jana Franklin

Subject:	Gagliardi Judge Appointment

Dear Governor Bush,

In March of this past spring, I wrote to you by mail in support of Josephine Gagliardi for a judicial appointment.  While she did not receive that appointment, she has been nominated for and interviewed for a County Court judgeship here in Lee County recently.

I believe in and support Jose for this judgeship.  She is an experienced local attorney, well known throughout Southwest Florida for her expertise in immigration law.  She is respected by many of my professional acquaintances in the community, visible and active in the Rotary Association.  She is also very well connected, fluent in Spanish and Italian, and the mother of a handicapped child.

In short, she is exactly the type of individual I feel the Republican Party needs working at the local level; smart, respected, compassionate and involved with all socioeconomic aspects of the community.  Please consider her strongly for this County judgeship; Lee County and the Florida Republican party will be the beneficiaries of her appointment.

Thank you,

Howard Finch

Jeb,
 
We are a local privately owned (me) bio-tech company that has been established in Boca Raton for 3 1/2 years.  I have lived in Boca for 30 plus years and built this organization from the ground up.  The purpose of this e-mail is to see how we can complement each other through incentives that the state may be able to offer.  We are looking for capital for job growth, expansion and to launch the world's only 100% biodegradable hands off home pregnancy test (patent protected).  I believe our alliance is exactly what is envisioned when you courted Scripps. We are a true byproduct of the this cluster and something you can be proud of.  Attached is information on our organization (Executive summary will be sent on request).  Healthcare is a huge issue and our company can save the state up to 70% on our products.  We need help to make this happen. I look forward to meeting with you.  I can be reached at any of the numbers below. You will not be sorry for taking a strong look.  Have a great day!

Ms. Rodriguez -

I today received a letter outlining the actions that  the Florida Bar has taken along with a message from the Florida Commission on Ethics stating their role in government and asking that I re-file my complaints. I have already done so. After more research I am now preparing additional complaints that will be directed to the Bar and others in government like you.

Other than a meaningless letter from Mr. Davis (who stated that the Governor himself asked that he respond to my situation) suggesting that I go to the very persons responsible for these abuses assistance I am lacking any meaningful communication from your office regarding my requests for oversight and intervention. 

If  your office and Governor Bush are indeed powerless to protect the rights of Florida citizens from persons empowered by public office and under your jurisdiction (as your deafening  silence projects) I would appreciate a clarification and outline of the powers of the Governor and your office in these types of situations so that I might share it with others via my website (www.billcagle.com) who find themselves caught in the same arrogant governmental web of noncompliance and obstruction of justice that  I now find myself in.

I am a citizen who has lost everything as a result of the provable misconduct of officials under your authority and I am again asking for your assistance

The courtesy of a meaningful, direct  response to a very important and increasingly very public problem would be appreciated.

A grant would allow my family to have a better life, however I have no idea how to go about getting one. I have checked all kinds of websites that "claim" to get you one; if you pay them.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

We would like invite you to “Talas and Rasas” dance performance by the Navarasa group to be held at 6:30 PM on September 23rd, 2006 at Freedom High School in New Tampa. This show is going to be an exciting and innovative combination of Indian classical Bharatnatyam dance as well as contemporary jazz and Bharatnatyam fusion performances. We are the first organization in the Tampa Bay area to be showcasing such professional-level talents of children who have been locally trained in both these dance forms. We would be honored to have you as our main guest at this event.  

 

Please accept our invitation to this premiere performance by the Navarasa group. Your presence will play an important role in our success. The performers are high school students and they all look up to you as a role model. Please bless and encourage the students with your presence.

 

The Performing Arts are essential to the complete development of our youth. Such performances of Indian classical dance also are of immense value in enriching the fabric of our community in addition to expanding the cultural diversity of the Tampa bay community as a whole.

 

The audience will be a mixture of people, many of whom are Tampa area Asian Americans of Indian descent. Most of them are well-established professionals, university professors and business owners. 

 

Please RSVP by September 1st, 2006. Our contact information is below. 

 

Also, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. Attached is the poster of the event for your viewing pleasure.

I know you are busy and must find it hard to work us into your schedule.   I am asking you to reconsider and make the special effort to come.
 
Below you will see we have built miniature twin towers (2.3% of the heights of the ones that were attacked in New York) to call people to remember this important day.   
 
 Already publicity about this event is going coast to coast.  We have had special articles in the Ocala Star Banner,  and in the Village Sun.   I also did an interview with K Love Radio which is in 44 of the 50 states of our country.   They called me from California.
 
Your Coming to this would add a lot to the occasion.

Governor-- 

My organization recently applied for the 2006-2007 DIG Program in order to obtain design funds for our proposed wastewater reuse facility (WWRF).  Using these funds will allow us to design a project that will result in "zero discharge" from our wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to the Lower St. Johns River (LSJR).

Right now our WWTP discharges 1.2 MGD to the LSJR.  Just think, John Ellis, that would equate to 29,201 pounds of nitrogen removed from the LSJR  Basin per year, a giant step in meeting the nutrient Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) recently established by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), and the EPA.

Jeb, we want to uphold our end and be a part of Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton's new plan, "The River Accord: A Partnership for the St. Johns River"; but to do that we need that money.  It will be a great day for the St. Johns River when on a calm day, not a single part of the river's surface offers the boiling proof of why the river turns green.  Now, doesn't just thinking about that bring tears to your eyes?

I am hoping you will announce our award at your earliest convenience.

I feel like a deck of cards just being shuffled from one department to the next.

Dear Lieutenant Governor Jennings:
 
Bill and I invite you to again join us and Host Ed Timberlake, President – Central Florida, Bank of America, in the tradition of hosting Frontline Outreach’s 12th Annual Benefit Luncheon for Children: The Power of Friendship.
 
As in the past, there are no tickets to sell. But by lending your name to the luncheon, and with just 60 minutes of your time on Friday, October 6, 2006, at 3000 C.R. Smith Street, we can once again impact significantly the urban kids of our community. Your arrival at 11:30 is requested for the noon meal.
 
Each year, the luncheon receives strong attendance by fellow legislators who serve the one-hour meal in 30 minute shifts. Last year we served nearly 400 community leaders. The result was $183,000 raised for Frontline scholarships and facility renovations. This is 20 percent of Frontline’s annual budget.
 
For over four decades, Frontline has been serving our city’s kids with unparalleled performance. Their educational, leadership, character and family development programs are changing lives in urban Orlando. We commend them in their mission to prepare tomorrow’s leaders with a vision for success and service.
 
Each year, Frontline’s partners enable the faith-based organization to serve almost 1,000 children and their families. Their results have earned them Bank of America’s 2005 Neighborhood Builder Award and the 2004 Walt Disney World DisneyHand Helping Children to Shine Award. Frontline has also been designated a “Point of Light” by the first President George Bush and a 2005 Governor’s Point of Light.
 
We look forward to seeing you on October 6 as we support our city’s children and our city’s future. Register NOW at www.fl-o.org (look for the Legislator’s Link). Or call 407-293-3000, ext 202, or reply by email at giving@fl-o.org.

Subject:	Don Rubottom's 50th Birthday

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Greetings!  My name is Emily Rubottom and I am the daughter of Don Rubottom, who works for the Florida House of Representatives.  My father is turning 50 on Thursday, September 7.  It is very difficult to buy gifts for my dad, because he is so very content with what he has.  He is not caught up with worldly possessions and his biggest hobby is spending time with us, his family.  When I asked my dad what he wanted for his 50th birthday, he said (very seriously), "I want the President of the United States to call me and wish me a happy birthday."  Well, I know from the White House web page that the White House doesn't send birthday greetings except for 80th-plus birthdays, but his comment gave me another idea.
 
May I be so bold, sir, as to ask you to call my dad and wish him a happy 50th birthday?  Dad has a great deal of respect for you, and our family has felt incredibly blessed to live in Florida for the past 9 1/2 years.  We are already grieving for what we feel will be a great loss when you leave office.
 
So, Mr. Governor, I know my dad would be extremely honored to receive birthday wishes from a man he respects so very much.  If you are able to do this, his office phone number at the Capitol is (850) 922-7076.
 
Thank you very much,
Emily Rubottom

COMMENTS: Governor Jeb Bush,

    My name is Deanna Howard I am a single 26-year-old mother of 5 children, ages 9,6,3,2 and 8 months. My oldest 3 are girls my last two are boys. I'm a high school graduate that attended Valencia Community College until I ran into childcare problems.  So I had to stop going to school and search for employment. I am an experienced customer service and reservation agent. I also have some administrative assistant experience. I have been looking for employment in one of those fields, but by me getting in trouble 4 years ago it is now hindering me from getting a good job. I am a Florida citizen that does all I can for my community. The trouble I got in consists of grand theft 3rd degree. What happened is I was in Dillard’s store shopping I ran into some old school mates who was in the store shoplifting. I didn’t know that is what they were doing until I was getting ready to walk out the store after purchasing my items, then officers informing that they were shoplifting and I wa!
 s getting in trouble because I was seen associating with them approached me. I just wanted to go ahead and get that over with so I did not take it to trail so I took a plea. Got on probation and violated by driving with suspended license and providing false information to a Leo. I also went to jail before but was never convicted o a crime until. I 'm 26 years now much wiser and mature. I'm asking you for a pardon to clear my life so I can find a good job and raise my kids to be better in life and become a great citizen as well. 

Thank you for your time, Deanna Howard

Dear Governor Bush:

Hello Mr. Bush. My name is John and I'm from Orlando. I want to know what 
exactly I can do to help make marijuana legal in Florida. I've smoked 
cannabis before, and always enjoyed myself. I also noticed it was much 
safer than alcohol! The question that always kept me going with wanting to 
help out with the struggle of marijuana, is that you can legalize a drink 
that will completely take over your body and cause so many accidents, but 
yet, not a plant that you can inhale to just make you feel relaxed and 
stress free. I really just don't understand that. I was told in school 
when I was younger to take action by getting in contact with your state 
representatives or sentors, so I figured I'd try it out. So here's my plea 
for the legalization of the cannabis. Hopefully this will make something 
good happen.

Sincerely,


John Pritchard

Dear Governor Bush,

 

We need your help!!!

Jacksonville, Florida has a problem. As you know, addiction touches all of us. Jacksonville is no exception.  Of high profile felony crimes in our city, nearly half are accounted for as drug crimes. In fact, not only does drug crime top the list in both number of charges filed and number of inmates admitted to our jail, drug-related crimes outnumber the next top three categories of criminal offenses combined. This year alone, 2,884 of the 4,593 those jailed on high-profile felony charges were charged with one or more drug related crimes.

 

We are Gateway Community Services, the largest not-for-profit substance addiction prevention and treatment agency on Florida’s First Coast. On Tuesday November 14, 2006 we will present our annual Community Champions’ Awards to community leaders who have supported our efforts and those of others who strive to build a better community. 

 

In addition to other local business leaders, this year’s recipients include Delores Barr-Weaver. Mrs. Weaver is a prominent in our community for two reasons. First, she and her husband Wayne own the NFL Jacksonville Jaguars and have the public’s recognition. Second, because she is a community leader who, in addition to supporting several other worthy causes in the community, has donated generously to champion our mission over the years through both the Jaguar foundation and the Weaver Family Foundation.

 

This event is our major fundraiser with proceeds going to build more residential facilities so we can help more people. We would be honored if you would join us as our keynote speaker and help us present our awards.

 

Our Awards Banquet will be:                                      The schedule of events will be:

 

Tuesday November 14, 2006

Dear Jan Bergemann,
 
      A big round of applause to Jan Bergemann! All of the CCFJ members should be very proud of the effort by Jan Bergemann. Mr. Bergemann has delivered on his promise to bring the DBPR directly to the condominium owners. Throughout the past couple of months the DBPR has scheduled meetings throughout the state of Florida to keep condo owners aware of legislation that impacts you as a condominium owner. The DBPR has also answered many questions from condo owners during these meetings. If you missed a previous meeting you should definitely not miss a future one.
     Thank you Jerry Melvin for our input during the August 22, 2006 meeting that was held in Destin Florida. Mr. Melvin is a former State Representative that continues to serve Floridians in their quest for balance and fair play between condo owners and condominium boards. His work is deeply appreciated!
     Finally. Thank you to the Director of the DBPR Mike Cochran and Jon Peet a financial specialist with the DBPR for answering numerous questions and sharing their wisdom concerning condominium regulations in the State of Florida during the meeting that was held in Destin Florida. The Governor should be quite proud to have these two outstanding individuals as employees for the state. Mr. Cochran and Mr. Peet were both very cooperative and forth coming with information concerning you as a condominium owner.  
 
                                                                                   Sincerely,

 Honor Jeb Bush, 
      I would like to present my strong reference for Josephine Gagliardi as your appointee to the bench as a Lee County Judge.  Josephine is an attorney in Lee County that has performed her duties with great dignity.  She has the highest integrity, she is a fair person with a keen knowledge of the law.  In our Rotary Club she volunteers for the American Cancer Society Relay for Life, and other club activities.  She is one of the staples of our community and I believe she is exactly the type of Judge that would epitomize the values and ethics the position demands.  Josie is the best choice for the appointment, and I hope she is your selection.

Dear Mr. Bush:
I do know how busy you are but I had hoped that your office would of had a answer about my PARDON.  I sent your office over fifty pages on what I have done for my community for the last thirteen years.  I am very disappointed that public officials break laws and are put back in the work force.  Again, I have coached for over 13yrs both boys and girls and I work at the hospital as a Nurse Tech. but I can't teach.  Something is totally wrong with this picture.  I feel I have been very patience and I was told by your office back in March of 2006, that someone would get back with me. I just feel I am being put off.  Please if you could do something before you leave office I would appreciate.  I am a true follower of all the BUSH traditions. I Feel if you were able to read all the letters that I sent this message wouldn't be necessary and I would be teaching.  Thank you for your time.  I look forward in your answer.

Was researching my choices in this latest election and came across this about Judge Greer.  I'm wondering why nothing was done?
 
Simmons had told a group who met with him in late March that he would consider starting an impeachment investigation concerning Greer.

In her letter of April 20, Hennessy said that "In his adjudication of the guardianship case of Terri Schiavo (File 90-2908), Judge Greer has entered what I believe to be illegal orders, which, if proven, would be grounds to conclude he has committed a "misdemeanor in office," as that term is used in Article III, Section 17 of Florida's Constitution.

"As a result of his rulings, Ms. Schiavo is now deceased and irreversible damage has been caused by his disregard of Florida's Statutes as they relate to the rights of incapacitated persons and abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults."

Hennessey itemized what she says are only two of the many violations of law in which Greer engaged.

"On March 8, 2005, Judge Greer entered an order stating that Terri Schiavo could not receive food and water by mouth after her gastronomy feeding tube had been removed. This order cannot be reconciled with Florida Statute 825.102 (Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of Elderly Persons and Disabled Adults), which defines the prohibited conduct:

(b) An intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical or psychological injury to an elderly person or disabled adult; or

(c) Active encouragement of any person to commit an act that results or could reasonably be expected to result in physical or psychological injury to an elderly person or disabled adult.

"A caregiver's failure or omission to provide an elderly person or disabled adult with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the elderly person's or disabled adult's physical and mental health, including, but not limited to, food, nutrition, clothing, shelter, supervision, medicine, and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of the elderly person or disabled adult; . . ."

"Judge Greer's order requires the commission of a felony - the withholding of oral sustenance and hydration from a disabled adult - something for which no judge at any level has jurisdiction to order and in complete disregard for his sworn duty to uphold the laws of the State of Florida", Hennessy says. "This feature of his ruling should be distinguished from his tube-removal order, an act over which he did have jurisdiction."

"The international scorn already heaped upon and to be heaped upon the United States in general and Florida in particular is directly traceable to this unnecessarily cruel and unlawful order.

"On March 23, 2005, Greer entered an Emergency Order Enforcing Mandate in which he ordered that the Department of Children and Families was restrained from carrying out a protective investigation into allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation of Terri Schiavo, pursuant to their statutorily mandated duties under Florida Statute Section 415.1051 (Adult Protective Services) which states, in part:

(b) Emergency removal from premises.--If it appears that the vulnerable adult lacks the capacity to consent to emergency protective services and that the vulnerable adult, from the personal observations of the representative of the department and specified medical personnel or law enforcement officers, is likely to incur a risk of death or serious physical injury if such person is not immediately removed from the premises, then the representative of the department shall transport or arrange for the transportation of the vulnerable adult to an appropriate medical or protective services facility in order to provide emergency protective services. Law enforcement personnel have a duty to transport when medical transportation is not available or needed and the vulnerable adult presents a threat of injury to self or others. If the vulnerable adult's caregiver or guardian is present, the protective investigator must seek the caregiver's or guardian's consent pursuant to subsection (4) before the vulnerable adult may be removed from the premises, unless the protective investigator suspects that the vulnerable adult's caregiver or guardian has caused the abuse, neglect, or exploitation.

(c) Emergency medical treatment.--If, upon admission to a medical facility, it is the opinion of the medical staff that immediate medical treatment is necessary to prevent serious physical injury or death, and that such treatment does not violate a known health care advance directive prepared by the vulnerable adult, the medical facility may proceed with treatment to the vulnerable adult."

"Judge Greer's injunction of DCF from performing its statutorily-mandated duties vividly demonstrates his lack of understanding of the separation of powers between the three branches of government. Instead of accommodating DCF's decision to exercise its authority under the above-cited statute, Judge Greer determined that decision to be offensive to him personally and to the judicial function in general."

"On March 23, 2005, in the order cited above, Judge Greer also ordered that "each and every singular Sheriff of the State of Florida are hereby directed to take such actions or action as is necessary to enforce the provisions hereof."

"In this order, Judge Greer overstepped his own authority under Florida's Constitution and usurped the power of the Executive Branch and Florida's Governor who is Florida's Chief Law Enforcement Officer. Article 4, Section 1 of Florida's Constitution states, in part:

(a) The supreme executive power shall be vested in a governor, who shall be commander-in-chief of all military forces of the state not in active service of the United States. The governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, commission all officers of the state and counties, and transact all necessary business with the officers of government.

"Judge George Greer has disregarded Florida's laws and the other branches of government in his rulings in the Schiavo case. I realize there may be some political distaste in pursuing this matter, but unless this judge is reined in, you will see this conduct occur again and again. The instances cited above are so flagrant as to require the House's serious consideration of articles of impeachment."

"I have numerous other records, orders and petitions from the Schiavo guardianship case and will happily get them to you in any form you require. It is imperative that you set to work on this immediately. Not only are Judge Greer's rulings not in keeping with the intent of your laws, they are flagrantly unlawful", Hennessy told Bense and the other officials.

At the time Simmons met with constituents in late March about an impeachment investigation of Greer, he told them he had received numerous emails and letters asking for an investigation of the judge. An Internet petition calling for Greer's impeachment has over 41,000 electronic signatures.

Article 3, Section 17 of the Florida Constitution says circuit court judges "shall be liable to impeachment for misdemeanor in office. Impeachment requires a two-thirds vote by the House and then a two-thirds vote by the Florida Senate to convict him, with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding over the Senate trial.

Simmons, said "we will look at it and analyze it" but said he wasn't committing to do anything other than review what any constituent tells me as a representative and as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to look at".

There are two ways for a Florida public officer, including a circuit court judge, to be removed from office----impeachment or executive order of Gov. Bush. Florida Constitution, Article III, Section 17 provides for the impeachment of judges among other public officers, for misdemeanor in office, misdemeanor being defined as a misdeed or offense less than a felony.

With public record supporting the allegation that Greer has not legally qualified for judicial office and allegedly violated election laws resulting in him vacating the office pursuant to Section 114.01, Gov. Bush is required pursuant to Section 114.01(2) to file an executive order with the Secretary of State setting forth the facts which give rise to the vacancy, setting forth the facts which give rise to the vacancy, and he must include in the order the title of the office, the name of the incumbent officer or person who held the office, and the date on which the vacancy in office occurred.

In the case of Greer, pursuant to the laws of the state he is supposed to be upholding, following the rule of law, by failing to qualify for office, he legally failed to obtain access to the ballot and was not legally elected, therefore never acquired legal title to the office. The vacancy would have initially occurred in January, 1998, and would have allegedly prohibited him for seeking "reelection" to a post he had not legally held initially.

Pursuant to Section 114.01, the office shall be considered vacant as of the date specified in the executive order, or in absence of such a date, as of the date the executive order is filed with the Secretary of State. jeb.bush@myflorida.com

Persons wishing to ask Gov. Bush why he has not issued an Executive Order removing Greer from the bench or why minimally he hasn't launched an investigation into Greer's filings for the ballot and alleged misconduct involving his political commercials may contact the Governor at jeb.bush@myflorida.com or his general counsel, Rachel Rodriguez at rachael.rodriguez@myflorida.com.

RE: HAROLD S. ESKIN’S NOMINATION FOR COUNTY JUDGE

 

DEAR GOVERNOR BUSH:

 

It is with great pleasure that I have the opportunity to write on behalf of Harold S. Eskin who has been selected by the 20th Judicial Circuit Judicial Nomination Committee to fill the recently vacated Lee County Judgeship.

 

I am a physician and, in addition to a busy clinical orthopaedic practice, I serve on several committees and boards of several state and national surgical specialty organizations

 

I have known Mr. Eskin for eight years and have had the opportunity to get to know Mr. Eskin in both his personal and/or professional capacity.  Professionally I have found Mr. Eskin to be honest, sincere, and of the highest ethical standards.

 

Personally, I have observed Mr. Eskin in various circumstances and found that he is a dedicated family man and a genuine person who is nice to be around. Additionally he has been involved in various civic and charitable activities, including being active in our synagogue, Temple Beth El.

 

What has struck me about Mr. Eskin is his ability to be fair-minded and seek knowledge. This was quite apparent when his wife recently required surgery and I observed, firsthand, how Hal gathers and processes information. I understand that this is his rigorous and customary manner in all of his professional, legal, and community activities. It is this quality, among others, that I feel would make him an outstanding judge.

 

For the foregoing reasons, I enthusiastically support Mr. Eskin’s selection for the bench. If you would like any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

 

Respectfully submitted,

RE: Glenn Martin for Circuit Court Judge

I highly recommend Glenn Martin for appointment to one of the open Circuit Court judgeships.  Glenn Martin is a veteran prosecutor with over 22 years of experience with the Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office.  Glenn has served his last 19 years as a special prosecutor, while prosecuting only the most serious of offenses.  Furthermore, Glenn Martin has served as a police officer and is highly acquainted with the difficulties and special nuances law enforcement officers face everyday.  

In tune with Glenn's outstanding experience, is his personal integrity.  Glenn Martin's integrity is engrained with his commitment to his work ethic; his commitment to his family; and his commitment to his community.  I believe it is the totalilty of all these outstanding characteristics that make Glenn Martin exceptionally qualified to perform the duties of a Circuit Court Judge.  

I have worked closely with Glenn on several high profile cases in Pinellas County.  Glenn Martin’s tenacity to get the job done, and more importantly, his integrity to get the job done right, is unparalleled.  Furthermore, Glenn is open-minded and highly conscious of other’s perspectives.  I fully support Glenn Martin for Circuit Court Judge, and I am confident that he will honorably serve Pinellas and Pasco Counties in this capacity. 

Thank you so much for your consideration.

Pinellas County Law Enforcement Officer.

Dear Governor Bush,

We received information on Monday, August 21st that our school, Cannella

Beth Kerly today in hopes that you would be attending our celebration.  I
was then given information that you would be attending a ceremony at Webb

celebration because Webb Middle School is only minutes away from our

My name is Christine Hanjian and I have emailed you in the past in hopes
that you could attend one of Cannella's Great American Teach Ins but you
were already booked.  I have been in education for 23 years and would
never change one school year. Both of my children attend schools in
Hillsborough County.  My oldest Cassandra is a senior at Alonso High
School in Hillsborough County and is currently ranked 6th in her class. 
My husband and I have worked hard to keep our children focused on school
and high achievement in anything they deem important in regards to school

Subject:	Illegal Aliens

Dear Governor Bush:

I live in the small town of Trenton, Florida but I was born and raised in 
Orlando, Florida.  My mother’s family had a relative we were able to trace 
back to one of the 3 ships that landed at Plymouth, Mass.  My father’s 
parents came here from Scotland in the early 1900’s and my father was a 
first generation American.  As you can see, my families from both sides were 
immigrants.  They were LEGAL immigrants and worked hard to support their 
families and better their ways of life.  They paid taxes and owned land and 
built homes and contributed to the betterment of the U.S. with their blood, 
sweat, tears and even their lives. My father even once said to me that he 
didn’t mind paying taxes to live in our free country.  He was a true 
patriot, having been in the second wave on Normandy on D-day.

As you may guess, I am writing about the mess our country is in with illegal 
immigrants.  They break the law as they take the first step onto our soil. 
Then they continue to do so as they stay on our soil. Yes, they perform work 
that many others will not do. Farm labor is backbreaking and thankless work. 
However, they should not be rewarded for breaking the law to earn dollars 
that are not taxed and much of which is sent to foreign soil to support 
their relatives and their foreign economy.

Children of illegal immigrants who are born here purely by calculation 
should not automatically be granted legal status as American citizens.  
Children who are born to an illegal mother should also be illegal and, 
therefore, not entitled to the Welfare and any other benefits this country 
freely offers. And since there are millions of illegals in this country, 
there are at least millions of “legal” children of illegals.  Those children 
have been afforded the rights of American citizens simply by accident of the 
location of their birth.  Those children will grow up to be voters and will 
eventually turn this country to their way of thinking.  That being that 
there should be no consequences to breaking the law. That we, soft-hearted 
and complacent Americans, should simply ignore their criminality and not 
only overlook their crimes, but also bestow on them all the benefits of 
being American.

You saw the crowds in the streets when the Mexicans and any other group of 
illegals or their legal children freely demonstrated en masse.  Did you also 
see them flying the flags of their countries? Did you also see their 
disrespect of the American flag? They truly feel that this country owes them 
something.  They feel downtrodden as their “legal” children attend and 
overburden our school systems.  They make our schools teach in both English 
and Spanish, further burdening the schools. They fill our hospitals because 
the hospitals will not turn them away when they have no insurance. They form 
gangs.  They steal identities. No, not all.

However, this is an issue that will eventually pervade every state in the 
union, except Alaska and Hawaii.  These people pay no taxes, yet they 
collect benefits from the taxes we Americans pay.  And we pay too much to 
begin with.  The tax rates in the country are ridiculous and much of that 
money is wastefully spent.  This is another issue, but I am also in favor of 
the Fair Tax.

Please...listen to all the voices of those who are too complacent to write 
to you.  There are many millions of us, more than there are of the illegals, 
who are all against amnesty.  Though it seems to be an impossible task, we 
must stop the flow of illegals daily into our state and country and deport 
all of those who can be deported. Please do not back down on this issue.  
Please think of your heritage and your children.  Please think of my 
children and grand-children.

Respectfully,
Robin Heath
Trenton, FL

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My mother-in-law, Dolly Jo Johnston, (lives with her son: M. Joe Johnston), 600 Quail Avenue, Longwood, Florida 32750, will be 100 years of age on 11/22/2006.
 
Her daughter and I would consider it an honor if you would attend her special day of celebration at the First Baptist Church,
Longwood, Florida o/about 11-10-2006. This date is tentative at this time but if this period is free in your schedule, I will confirm
the exact date as soon as possible. At any rate, we would be pleased if you could send her a personal birthday greeting.
 
It is not very often we get a chance to honor someone who has lived so long and still remain very alert  (plays solitaire and Hand and Foot card) games on a regular basis. Too, she actively attends Sunday School and church on a weekly basis. Periodically, she goes to luncheons with several in her class. Her mental awareness confounds most of us.

As the retired executive director of the Collier County Housing Authority and an appointee of yours to the Big Cypress Water Management and the Immokalee Water and Sewer districts, I would like to add my thoughts, to the many you have already received, concerning LIZ ADAMS, candidate for Lee County Judge.
As you will note in her bio, she has a strong commitment toward helping individuals to become families and helping families develop stronger bonds to better train and nurture our future generations. We need people on the Bench who have the sensitivity and experience to make decisions that will help salvage dysfunctional persons and families.
LIZ ADAMS is what our Bench needs. Your appointment of her as  the Lee County Court Judge is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much and in continued support.

Governor Bush

I am writing to ask that you give serious consideration to Mr. Glenn Martin for one of the openings.  I have known Glenn since childhood and truly believe that he would be one of the best judges that we could possibly have in this area.  He has served Pinellas and Pasco well for over 30 years as a police officer and assistant State Attorney (22 years).  He has tremendous experience in the court room having prosecuted 65 jury trials including several very high profile cases.  It is not surprising that his name has been sent to you by the Sixth Judicial Nominating Committee in regards to all of the resent resignations and vacancies in our circuit.  They have recognized his ability, qualifications, and talent after a thorough investigation.  Glenn has unquestioned integrity.  His knowledge of the law, the fair and balanced demeanor that he exhibits, will make him a judge that we can all be proud of.  His character is above reproach.

I have watched Glenn raise his children.  His son and my son are best friends.  We attended the same church when we were kids.  He is a dedicated family man and along with his wife of 32 years, Linda, has spent many hours helping the children of the community through their tireless support of youth groups at the churches where they worshipped.  He, also, plays a mean guitar.

 

Governor, I know it is always a difficult choice in these matters but I honestly believe that you could not make a better one than Glenn Martin for one of these vacancies.  He is a man truly qualified to be a great judge.  I’m sure he would make you proud.

Ms Rodriguez - 
I am attaching PDF copies of complaints I filed with the Florida Commission on Ethics so that your office will be fully aware of the situation and the serious nature of the events I have evidence of. I will follow up with copies sent via certified US Postal mail to your office. I am again publically calling for intervention and oversight by  your office and the Governor.

I understand that the Commission is limited to the financial disclosure and conflict of interest laws contained in Part III, Chapter 112, Florida Statues, and Article II, Section 8, Florida Constitution, as they apply to individual public officers and employees but, my intention is to create an accountability trail until the constant state agency run around I am getting stops and some one with the proper authority is reached and takes ownership of the situation.

It seems that Bill Eddins, Florida State Attorney / District 1 answers to no one and can apparently do whatever he pleases. Does your office and the Governor himself have no power to become actively involved when the legal rights of a citizen of the State of Florida are so carelessly trampled? 

I would like to hear from you the answer to that question and a clarification on just what the chain of accountability is in state government.

Please carefully review the attached documents, visit the website I have been forced to put up www.billcagle.com read and understand the situation and please direct me to the proper authorities if you are not the authority.


Respectfully -

Subject:	Do Not Execute Clarence Edward Hill!

I wish to appeal to you on behalf of Clarence Edward Hill, who is due to be executed on January 24, 2006.  

Hill was 23 at the time and there is evidence to suggest that Jackson masterminded the crime.  There is also evidence to suggest that Hill was under the influence of cocaine at the time of the crime. Furthermore, evidence and testimony show that Hill was known by his neighbors and family to be a caring and nonviolent person and that he had a trouble free-history throughout his years in school and in the neighborhood where he lived. 

Clearly Hill is not the worst of the worst and therefore the death penalty is not appropriate for Clarence Edward Hill.  In view of the above mentioned information, I urge you to act quickly to correct this situation and spare the life of this human being.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this important and urgent matter.

Hello Mr. Bush, my name is Jennifer and I represent a local company out of Titusville, FL called HMD BioMedical.  You had met with my CEO in Duesseldorf last year at the healthcare show (I attached a small photo of this.)  You spent your valuable time attending this trade show to prove your support for businesses in the state of Florida.  Because of you coming to the show and having support for Florida businesses, we were able to ascertain the worldwide marketing rights on a diabetic meter manufacturered out of Korea.  In our industry, it is so very difficult to get contracts because of the competitors we are up against are Johnson & Johnson, Abbott and Bayer.  We absolutely appreciate your support and I was hoping we could take this a step further.  Currently our company's annual sales is in the millions of dollars, and we have an opportunity to be in the billions with a new disease management system.  If we only had your endorsement of our product and our company, we are certain we can bring this worldwide business into the State of Florida, and over 50% of our profits will stay within the state.  If you could only provide me a little of your time or if I can meet with an assistant to show you the product we will be introducing to insurance payors within the next few months.  
 
All we are looking for is an endorsement letter from your office that we can bring with us to the manufacturing company in Korea to show even our local government is behind us to support our efforts to bring this business into the US rather than keeping in Korea.  Our meeting is scheduled for September 2nd, so I know this does not give you a lot of time, but the business that will be generated from this will absolutely justify your time.    
 
Thanks for your help,
Jennifer

Subject:	regarding Katherine Harris, from Mary Jo Melone

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
You may remember me as a St. Petersburg Times columnist who wrote a piece about you that you thought was too kind-- about speaking Spanish to the public during hurricane preparations in 2004. 
 
Well, I'm back again, now as a freelancer, and trying, like journalists from here to the moon, to write about Katherine Harris. I am not, however, interested in the foot race -- who's up, who's down -- in the polls.
 
I am interested in writing about Harris in a more personal way: it's been suggested to me that she is unable to do the wise thing and drop out...or was unable, because it is certainly too late now -- because she never recovered from the very personal trashing she endured during the 2000 recount. It's as though she has to prove everybody wrong and that if she wins, she will gain back some dignity that she feels she lost.
 
This may strike you as armchair psychology....but I'd love to hear your observations. And if you know of any of Harris' friends who I might talk to, could you pass on the names?
 
I know that given my reputation (which has not faded over the two years I've been gone) as a "liberal" columnist you may have little interest in replying, but I figured, what the heck, and decided to try anyway. 
 
Thank you.

                                                            Commendation



                                                    Re: Deputy Jeff Cuttitta 
and Officer Andrew Gillespie



Last Wednesday night I placed a call to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office 
to report my 89 year old father missing.  He had been gone since 8:30 AM 
that morning and the search my brother and I did produced nothing.



Deputy Jeff Cuttitta met me at my father's house.  He immediately put out a 
BOLO. After hearing all of the particulars about my father's recent mental 
state and age he made the decision to place a missing/endangered person 
report.

I felt he made a critical decision to place that report and showed 
exceptionally good judgment.  He probably saved my father's life.



Within 10 minutes of the notice going out, I got a call from Orlando City 
police officer, Andrew Gillespie, saying he found my father in the most 
dangerous area of the city, sitting at a stop sign. My father did not know 
how he got there from his home in Palm Harbor.  Once again the quick 
thinking of a police officer kept my father out of harm's way.



Officer Andrew Gillespie took my father to a nearby fire station and got him 
something to eat.  It was now 10:00PM. He stayed with my father, rather than 
abandon him at the police station and ensured he was safe until I could get 
there. I had to drive two hours from Palm Harbor, Fl.



When I arrived at the fire station, my Dad was in remarkably good spirits, 
smiling and talking to Officer Gillespie. Words couldn't describe my relief 
or my gratitude.



These two police men exemplify the motto, "To Protect and Serve."



I am so impressed with their professionalism I wanted to personally let you 
know.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My name is Abby Hunter and i am organizing a HOBY CLEW. HOBY stands for Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership, and if you like old westerns, Hugh O'Brian played Wyatt Earp in the old western series Wyatt Earp. A CLEW is a Community Leadership Education Workshop which is a one day version of the HOBY weekend that is held in Tallahassee, FL during a weekend in June. 
 
What I am interested in is if you would not mind coming and speaking at the Government panel held at 9 AM on Saturday October 21, 2006. I understand that you are really busy with your position and I understand if you cannot make it. If you are preoccupied on that date, I would really appreciate it if you could give me the information of someone in state government who might be able to attend. 
 
The government panel consists of 3 to 4 local and state government officials who give a 3 to 5 minute speech about their position and what their occupation requires. Once all the panelists have had a chance to speak, there will be an open time for the students to ask questions to the panelists. 
 
If you are interested in this program, please visit www.hoby.org or www.northfloridahoby.org. If you have any further questions for me, you can reach me at 1-850-974-1311 or 1-850-859-2366. I anticipate your response.

I’m now trying to start my own Dry Cleaning Service, I have the knowledge the experience and the drive to do it but I don’t have any money to start.  I went to bank but I was not able to get a loan.  I recently heard about a program called the Mom and Pop grant (the program loans money to people that want to start a small business) but when I contacted the person in charge I was told that they are not taking any applications at this time.  I would like to know if there is any where else that I could go to look for something like this.  Also I would like to know if I could get the application from your office. Thank you for your time and I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

I was once a parole and probation officer for the state of Florida for 12 and one half years. I did high profile cases.  I have two men on death row now.  There is one man I believe that deserves to be paroled.  he is Calvin Campbell.  He is originally a death row case.  I think he should be placed on Community Control and released on parole for the rest of his life.  Please do an investigation on his case.  I've thought about this for 18 years, and it's taken me this long to write this.  He is a very brilliant man.  It serves no purpose to keep him locked up any longer.  I believe he killed Deputy Fish in self-defense originally.  He got the death penalty for that.  He has suffered enough for this. Pease consider his case.

Governor Bush
 
 The constant delays in death penalty appeals has got to be put to an immediate stop.Right now, the state of Florida has 376 inmate's on death row, 19 less then Texas's death row population of 395 (TDCJ website says 396 but an inmate was put to death in TX last week). Texas averages about 20 executions per year. Florida, on the other hand, averages 1 to 2 executions a year. I find this absolutely ridiculous. It make's me sick to think that inmate's on death row since the 70's and 80's are still appealing their sentences. The only difference between inmates who have been on death row since the 70's and 80's in Texas (which are very few by the way), is that those inmates were all resentenced. Almost 90 % of the inmates on Texas death row who sit their appealing their sentences from the 70's and 80's have all had their convictions and/or sentences overturned.
 
 I would like to ask that you please stop stalling and please start moving forth with carrying out the punishment handed down by Florida juries. These death row inmate's have had their chances to appeal. The standard three tier appeals process in every death penalty state is as follows:
 
1.)Direct Appeal
2.)State Postconviction Review/State habeas corpus petition
3.)Federal Habeas (Federal District Court/11th Circuit Court of Appeals)
 
 The bottom line is that Florida is letting inmate's stall their executions with meritless successive postconviction motions. The Florida Supreme Court has been too lenient in allowing inmates to file these motions, so it is your duty to see to it that these executions are carried out and death warrants signed whether there is or is not a successive postconviction motion filed. I respect you greatly as our Governor Mr.Bush. I admire you greatly. It is also my understanding that you hold strong support for the death penalty. The only problem is that I don't see you signing death warrants. I ask, on behalf of all Floridians waiting for justice, that you proceed with signing these death warrants for inmates who have lost there final 'LEGAL' appeals in the 11th circuit. After a death row inmate loses an appeal in the 11th circuit, this is supposed to be their last avenue of relief. Here in Florida, I find it pretty disgusting that executions are being held up on useless successive postconviction motions when the inmate knows its going to be denied. It's only to stall executions. It has to stop Governor.
 
 Please, see Justice is Served.

FLORIDA STUDENTS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN FOURTH ANNUAL HISPANIC HERITAGE
MONTH ESSAY CONTEST
 
On Tuesday, First Lady Columba Bush and I invited Florida students in
kindergarten through twelfth grades to participate in the fourth annual
Florida Hispanic Heritage Month essay contest. The essay contest is the
first in a month-long schedule of events planned to commemorate Florida's
Hispanic heritage. The theme of the essay contest is, 'Why is learning about
Florida's Diverse Hispanic Heritage and Culture Important?'
 
Columba and I are proud of the Spanish and Latin-American influences that
contribute to Florida's rich culture and history and play a dynamic role in
shaping our history and future.  Hispanic Heritage month gives us the
opportunity to educate Florida's students on the tremendous contributions
Hispanic individuals make to our state.  We are asking students to pay
special tribute to the Florida's diverse Hispanic population and their
contributions to the state's culture, economy and education. The theme for
Florida's 2006 Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration is 'La Florida: Honoring
Our State's Spanish and Latin American Influences'.  Those interested in
participating in the essay contest or obtaining more information on
additional Hispanic Heritage Month events should visit
www.floridahispanicheritage.com or contact Nadia Hagberg in the Governor's
office at (850) 488-5000 for more information.
 
 
RECORD NUMBER OF FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TOOK THE ACT
 
On Wednesday, Education Commissioner John L. Winn and I announced a record
number of Florida's high school graduates took the American College Test
(ACT).  This year 66,299 of Florida's 2006 high school graduates took the
ACT, up from 58,302 in 2005. Of all high school graduates, 44 percent took
the ACT in Florida compared to 40 percent nationally. The ACT is one of two
college entrance tests Florida students can choose to take. Last year, more
than 93,500 of Florida's 2005 high school graduates took the SAT,
representing 65 percent of the total number of high school graduates.
 
Florida has been extremely successful at increasing the number of students
taking college entrance exams.  We must continue to encourage all of our
high school students to take these exams and prepare for the rigor of
college and the workforce.  Minority students represent 47 percent of the
2006 test takers, compared to 30 percent nationally.  During 2006, African
Americans represented 21 percent of the Florida test takers, compared to
only 13 percent nationwide.  Hispanic students comprised 17 percent of
Florida test takers, compared to only eight percent nationally.  To learn
more about the ACT visit www.fldoe.org.  To learn more about FACTS.org or to
complete an ePEP, visit www.FACTS.org.
 
 
POINTS OF LIGHT AWARDED TO JERMAINE PHILLIPS
 
I recognized Jermaine Phillips, a starting safety for the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, as this week's Points of Light Award recipient.  Jermaine's
efforts are making a positive difference in the lives of those he visits at
Central Florida hospitals, retirement homes and juvenile justice programs.
Jermaine's commitment to Florida's youth has proven that he is a champion
both on and off the field.  Through his volunteerism and philanthropy, many
young Floridians have a brighter future.  For more information, or to
nominate, go to www.VolunteerFloridaFoundation.org.

Dear Governor Bush,

Wow, what an educational high our school, Southwest Middle, Orlando, is on!  

We are the top middle school in Orlando raising our bottom 25% in reading to 78% of students making gains.  Many of our ESOL students scored 3’s and 4’s this.  Also, we were just named one of the top 75 High Achieving Schools and are one of five schools in Orange County to the Pilot Red Carpet Certified recipients.

With all this achievement we are only missing one thing; a visit from you!  We would love to have you come by our school the next time you are in the Orlando area.  We are located two blocks from Universal Studios. 

Thank you for my position, I am the reading coach.  I have been very lucky to work with a wonderful, dedicated group of educators over the years.  

We would really love to have you come by as Governor before you leave office. Thanks also for taking such good care of students during hurricane season.  You are the best.

Sincerely,

Dr. Bonnie Sommer, Reading Coach

Dear Governor Bush,
                   The areas of Punta Gorda & Port Charlotte, have undergone
a metamorphosis since hurricane Charly, and
 we have seen a big escalation of prices for Homeowners insurance.  Sadly,
the Real Estate maket is on a spiralling downward
 trend, and not much is selling.  Eventually, if this trend continues, many
Companies will be going out of buisness.
 We could use any help you can give us by you paying a visit to our region,
as you are an extremely influential person, and
 we need all the help you can give us, by your good publicity,advertizing
our areas.
                   Needless to say you are respected and loved in this area,
and as Governor you are admired by everyone.
 I know that the adverse publicity our region gets from the National Press,
has not helped the Real Estate market, but to
date there has not been a serious Hurricane in our area, but yet it seems
that every time we look at the TV, some reporter
always has somthing adverse to say, giving the impression of disappointment
that we have not had another hurricane.  This
kind of Gloom, is killing our Real Estate Buisness!  Please come and visit
us, I'll be more than happy to BBQ a good Steak
for you when you visit my humble home.( By the way my Charlotte High School
Grandaughter thinks you are the best person in the world, and her ultimate
wish is to meet you!)
                   Personally speaking my whole family and all my friends
would love to meet you.  Thank you Governor Bush,
and we look foward to seeing you soon!

Dear Governor,

I'm writing to you regarding Clarence Hill who is scheduled to be executed 
on September 20th. As a member of amnesty international I'm deeply concerned

regarding the fact that Hill has an execution date even though the U.S.
Supreme 
Court ruled 9-0 that Clarence Hill can appeal his case to a federal court. 
The appeal is pending.

Governor Bush, an execution would be in violation of the right to life as
proclaimed 
in the UN Declaration of Human Rights and would perpetuate the cycle of
violence. 
So I urge you to stop the execution and to commute his death sentence.

Thank you for your time and attention in this very serious matter.

I was shocked to hear the Republicans presented their version of the bill of about 173  pages at the 11th hour of the session closing for voting.  It's unheard of in a democracy to treat people like that.  It will hurt your legacy as well as the future of the Republicans in the state.

Dear Governor Bush, 


I write you today in support of my long time friend and client Larry Anzalone. I have known Larry for over twenty years. Our children have grown up together. Larry has been a confidant to me in personal matters. 

I have owned a State Farm Insurance agency in Tampa for twenty-four years. I have watched Larry be successful as an attorney, a father, a friend and as a mediator. Larry is a voice of reason. He is rational in his thinking and sincere in his behavior. 

Larry is a long time member of our church and has served on our financial committee. He has been a staunch Republican all of his life. His father was also a successful business man. 

Larry has years of trial experience, both as a plaintiffs attorney and a defense attorney. His ethics are beyond reproach. 

Larry Anzalone is passionate about being a Judge of Compensation Claims. His years of experience and his sense of fairness will guide him and serve our state proudly.


Sincere thanks, 



Jeff Ralph

Dear Governor,
You are nearing the end of your term as governor, and by many accounts, you can leave knowing that you have been good for most of Forida's citizens.  Please do not now spoil your image by seeking Hill's death, even though the judicial branch has not yet acted on it.
Please do not think that this will make you "tough on crime," nor enhance your image as a strong enforcer.  It will only make you seem mean-spirited, eager to kill a few more people before your time is up.
Mr. Bush, you can do better than this.  You can be better than this.

Subject:	Save the USS Des Moines

Mr. Bush,
 I am writing to you about a naval ship, the USS Des Moines is scheduled to be scraped soon and I wish for it to be preserved. I believe it can happen and would like to see if the governor would help. In Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, the state of Alabama used the USS Alabama as a emergency center as well as a shelter.That is not the only thing the ship is used for, education and tourism are others. Dedicated in Pensacola, Florida, it with the Naval Aviation Museum, the Blue Angels and the State of Florida have wonderful resource for education, an emergency coordination center/shelter and tourism dollars. Working with your brother,Mr. George W. Bush, I believe this can happen to bring the USS Des Moines to Pensacola. Please lets not let another proud part of our history go to the chopping block, lets preserve this vessel.
LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Thank You,
Keith Russell

Subject:	Mr. Clarence Hill

Dear Governor Bush:
 
What is the rush to execution for Clarence Hill when the US Supreme Court, by a 9-0 decision, has allowed an appeal to be considered?  It is not as though Mr. Hill is going to go somewhere he can't be found should the appeal go against him.  But if there is some merit to the civil rights claim, and you've executed him in the meantime, the whole consideration -- at least for him -- is moot.  And that is not a just process...regardless of the outcome and future action based on it.
 
I am asking you, Governor Bush, to reconsider your decision in this matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Lee Breyer

Dear Governor:

 

It is my long service to the Brevard County community that moves me to write this letter of reference to you on behalf of Michael L. Bowen’s nomination for the position of County Court Judge in Brevard County.

 

Having served as a Cocoa Beach Police Officer for over twenty-seven years with almost ten years as its Chief of Police, I have been professionally associated with Mr. Bowen for at least half of my tour of duty.  I know him as an individual of outstanding moral character and professional ethics.  He is an extremely hard working and dedicated professional that is making a difference in the community we live in.  I am extremely confident that he would continue to make a positive difference if appointed to the position of Brevard County Court Judge.  I support his nomination without any reservation.

 

Should you or your staff require additional information, I can be contacted at (321) 609-0234.

Dear Jeb:
 
On December 11, 2006, one of our neighbors here in Gables Estates, Miss Lamar Louise Curry will turn 100.  Jack and I are having a birthday luncheon for her at The Riviera Country Club at noon.  We would love for you to attend.  Bob Graham is one of her students from Miami High, and he is attending.  But, even if your schedule does not permit you to attend, may we get a letter from you to her congratulating her on her birthday.  She is a republican...or at least votes Republican.
 
Her mother raised the money for Bayfront Park in Miami...and they moved to Miami from Key West where she was born...when she was 10.  She has donated the Challenger Memorial located in Bayfront Park in front of the Intercontinental Hotel to The City of Miami and placed money in perpetuity to maintain it.   Additionally, there is a middle school named for her in Dade County, The Lamar Louise Curry Middle School, in recognition of the fact that she taught so many "leaders" of  Florida including Bob Graham and Bob Traurig, and of her donations to education.
 
Also, how do we get a letter from your brother, whom she supported in his election, acknowledging her 100th birthday?
Thanking you in advance and saying hello,

FLORIDA STUDENTS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN FOURTH ANNUAL HISPANIC HERITAGE
MONTH ESSAY CONTEST

On Tuesday, First Lady Columba Bush and I invited Florida students in
kindergarten through twelfth grades to participate in the fourth annual
Florida Hispanic Heritage Month essay contest. The essay contest is the
first in a month-long schedule of events planned to commemorate Florida's
Hispanic heritage. The theme of the essay contest is, 'Why is learning about
Florida's Diverse Hispanic Heritage and Culture Important?'
 
Columba and I are proud of the Spanish and Latin-American influences that
contribute to Florida's rich culture and history and play a dynamic role in
shaping our history and future.  Hispanic Heritage month gives us the
opportunity to educate Florida's students on the tremendous contributions
Hispanic individuals make to our state.  We are asking students to pay
special tribute to the Florida's diverse Hispanic population and their
contributions to the state's culture, economy and education. The theme for
Florida's 2006 Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration is 'La Florida: Honoring
Our State's Spanish and Latin American Influences'.  Those interested in
participating in the essay contest or obtaining more information on
additional Hispanic Heritage Month events should visit
www.floridahispanicheritage.com or contact Nadia Hagberg in the Governor's
office at (850) 488-5000 for more information.


RECORD NUMBER OF FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TOOK THE ACT
      
On Wednesday, Education Commissioner John L. Winn and I announced a record
number of Florida's high school graduates took the American College Test
(ACT).  This year 66,299 of Florida's 2006 high school graduates took the
ACT, up from 58,302 in 2005. Of all high school graduates, 44 percent took
the ACT in Florida compared to 40 percent nationally. The ACT is one of two
college entrance tests Florida students can choose to take. Last year, more
than 93,500 of Florida's 2005 high school graduates took the SAT,
representing 65 percent of the total number of high school graduates.

Florida has been extremely successful at increasing the number of students
taking college entrance exams.  We must continue to encourage all of our
high school students to take these exams and prepare for the rigor of
college and the workforce.  Minority students represent 47 percent of the
2006 test takers, compared to 30 percent nationally.  During 2006, African
Americans represented 21 percent of the Florida test takers, compared to
only 13 percent nationwide.  Hispanic students comprised 17 percent of
Florida test takers, compared to only eight percent nationally.  To learn
more about the ACT visit www.fldoe.org.  To learn more about FACTS.org or to
complete an ePEP, visit www.FACTS.org.

I recognized Jermaine Phillips, a starting safety for the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, as this week's Points of Light Award recipient.  Jermaine's
efforts are making a positive difference in the lives of those he visits at

Dear Governor Bush:
 
            I am currently an Honor Student and Junior at Florida Atlantic University, as well as a single mother, studying to be a doctor.  I am writing this letter to find out how I may be granted clemency. Unfortunately, I do not feel that having my record sealed or expunged is an option due to my future occupation.  Part of my career path requires me to volunteer in the community as well as to gain experience in the field of medicine, shadowing and working closely with health care professionals and their patients.  From my research, I have learned that this particular field has access to certain records that most employers do not.  I have been honest with the institution I currently attend about my past; however, I feel that my criminal record has the potential to damage my future career in medicine. In the following paragraph, I explained my situation and only wish now to put my past behind me.  Other than this, I have never been in any trouble with the law.  I would like to explore my options on how I can have this removed from my record and would also like information on reinstating my voting rights.  I have overcome many obstacles in my life and admit that I finally need help with this situation.  Being a full time student and single-mother, I do not have the financial means to hire an attorney to assist me with this.   Any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated. 
On July 28, 2000, I was arrested at Sears and charged with Grand Theft in the third degree.  The authorities claimed that I knowingly used two gift cards that were purchased with stolen credit cards.  I admit that most of the facts contained in the police report are correct except for a few minor mistakes.  The report claimed that I gave the authorities a false name, which is untrue.  I did give the store clerk a false name, as I do at all stores who ask for personal information when making a purchase, because I believed it was intended for telemarketing purposes.  When detained by the authorities, I willingly gave them my correct information, which they believed to be untrue.  I searched frantically for my license and could not find it in my purse, and it was later found in my pants pocket with the exact information I had supplied them with.  They asked me to furnish the name of the person from whom I had purchased the cards and I refused as it was a member of my family.  
Prior to this incident, I had no knowledge that I was in any way committing a crime.  I was offered pre-trial intervention, in which I would have had to write a letter admitting my guilt, yet I declined the prosecutor’s offer as I refused to tell a lie about my involvement.  I opted instead to take the issue to trial, under the advice of counsel who due to my economic circumstances was a public defender.  When the day of my trial arrived the judge made a comment insinuating that he was not going to be lenient if I were convicted and would give me jail time.  This being my first and only infraction, I believed him and decided that although I was innocent, it was in my best interest to enter a plea of no contest with adjudication withheld and serve eighteen months probation.  I did not feel that I would be convicted; however, I could not take the risk of my child going to my abusive, substance-abusing ex-husband.  
            There was no way that I could have known that the cards that I was using were illegally purchased, although I would not allow myself to be put in a situation like that again.  The person who sold me the cards has since served time in prison for other similar offenses, and I sincerely hope that this person has learned their lesson.  
This infraction taught me an important life lesson about being naïve, and I have since learned from it.  I feel that every experience in life teaches you something and if you can overcome all obstacles, you will become a stronger and more resilient person.  
I sincerely hope that you can appreciate my honesty and not hold this incident against me.  I have worked very hard to achieve what I have, and would hate to lose it all now, so close to fulfilling my dream of becoming a doctor.  Like I mentioned before, this is my only altercation with the law.  I have not ever been charged or even suspected of any scholastic misconduct.  I hold education in the highest regard and I hope my academic record speaks for itself.  Thank you for taking the time to review my situation and I genuinely hope that you can in some way assist me with this unfortunate impediment that stands in the way of my career in medicine.  
 
Sincerely,
Stacie Davis

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I don't know if you take the time to personally view and/or review any of the e-mails that are sent to you by unknown, everyday citizens like me.  I hope that in this case, someone either brings this one to your direct attention, or that you read it yourself.  
 
I am a U.S. Citizen and have been a Florida resident for the last 30 years.  I am also of Cuban origin in that I am Cuban born.  I receive daily e-mails from many friends, mostly not political but humorous, inspirational and friendly messages. This one in particular, however, caught my attention as it reminded me of the things I personally saw and lived while living in Cuba as a little girl. 
 
Governor, I have never been involved in politics, not do I want to be involved in them. However, I would not want to see the things I experienced for a short period of time while growing up in Cuba and being somehow, while still living there  indoctrinated to follow the ideas presented in my attachment to you, I would not want for them to be implemented in any way throughout the Americas, even more so now that it seems a dinosaur may soon not be so ferocious anymore on its own, but that is relentless trying to  teach and coach others to take after his views and ways, to leave a more permanent mark in the history of the world.  
 
I am sure the U.S. Government is aware of situations like this.  Nevertheless, I wanted to share this with someone of your stature in the U.S. Government. 
 
I would greatly appreciate it if you take the time to view the 30 minute attachment I am sharing with you.  Please be aware, that this attachment is completely in Spanish, as it seems it was produced and narrated by a female reporter from Spain or of Spanish descend.  
 
Thanking you in advance for your attention.

Dear Governor Bush,

Would you please explain why you have re-signed the Death Warrant for Clarence Hill despite the U. S. Supreme Court unanimous ruling that he can appeal his case to a federal court.

With his appeal pending, I cannot understand your action.

Please explain.

THE NUMBERS ON THE HISPANIC INVASION

That's right.  The invasion is still underway.  

Here's an interesting website for you.  It's called immigrationCounters.com  the #1 Site for Real-Time Immigration Statistics.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the information on this site, but it sure does get your attention.

*	Illegal Immigrants in Country    20,426,887 
*	Money wired to Mexico    $23,575,296,302 
*	Cost of Social Services for Illegal Immigrants        $397,469,111,828 
*	Illegals Enrolled in Government Schools K-12        3,749,373 
*	Cost of Illegal Immigrants Enrolled in K-12        $14,489,987,299 
*	Illegal Immigrants Incarcerated        315,460 
*	Cost for Incarcerations of Illegal Immigrants    $1,446,245,595 
*	Illegal Immigrant Fugitives        623,761 

Here's a statistic from elsewhere, one that I did check out.  Out of all of the outstanding warrants for murder in Los Angeles, 95% of them are for illegal aliens.

One more thing:  The House immigration bill called for the borders to be controlled and contained no guest worker program; the Senate had a bill calling for amnesty and only a token attempt to control the borders.  Nothing got done.  The Senate bill was written by Harry Reid and Ted Kennedy.  It contained a provision for about 370 miles of fencing along the Mexican-U.S. Border.  But, here's the catch.  That fence can only be built after consulting Mexico as to its location.  Well isn't that special!  Mexico gets to decide where we put our border fences!

Dear Gov Bush
I am interested  in finding out how I can go about applying for a state grant to start a small business in Flagler County My husband and I currently have a DJ business and wanted to open a dance hall and coffee shop. I have a  handicap friend who is in a wheelchair and I would like to hire her and other people like her to serve coffee or take tickets at the door. 
My first idea was to have a dance hall for teens to keep them off the streets however insurance for that is very high. Therefore I would like to open a dance hall for all ages and have special nights like disco night, 50's night etc... and serve gourmet coffee. I feel it is important to help our handicap friends earn a salary and give them something fun to do and to help them feel important. Thank You for your time.

Governor Bush,
 
Signing the Death Warrant for Clarence Hill while so many issues remain unresolved was a huge and troubling mistake.  You had stated that you would not sign any more Death Warrants until the courts could rule on the current challenges.
 
We Floridians expect better and more forthright leadership.  
 
We need leaders who value life and justice more than expediency.
 
It may have been legal, but it was just wrong.

August 18, 20206
 
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
Please allow Mr. Clarence Hill the opportunity to use the right which The Supreme Court of the United States has offered him.  He has been granted the time, by The Supreme Court to appeal the method of execution which the State of Florida uses to end his life; allow him to make use of this right.
 
I am sure that you are aware that all organized religious groups in the world have issued a statement declaring that if the citizens of a country can be protected from a person by keeping them in prison without parole we do not have the right to end this persons life.  We are responsible for offering him the opportunity to find forgiveness from his God and to have some form of religious and spiritual rehabilitation.  We do not have the right to murder him to prove that murdering is an improper act.
 
The Supreme Court has given you the opportunity to make use of their decision, please allow Mr. Hill to file his appeals and claims.  So very many citizens have changed their minds about the death penalty due to human failings and errors in our death penalty system.  At this time, or any time I don't believe that the people of the State of Florida need to see another death.  I would be wonderful to see that we have a government which still cares about an individual and allows him the right to follow through with the rights which our judicial system has offered him.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Flordia Governor Jeb Bush:
 
I recently returned from working in Washington, D.C. as an intern at the U.S. Conference of Mayors through the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. As part of my internship experience, I am required to write a research paper. I have chosen to discuss inter-governmental relations and the influence of mayors and governors on Federal policy.
 
Mayors and Governors from across the United States have been an increasingly loud voice in the office halls of the nation's capital. At the Conference of Mayors, I head about mayoral appearances before Congressional hearings and have been paying attention to the recent gathering of Governors at the National Governors Association Meeting.
 
To understand more about city and state leader's influence over Federal policy, I hope you will indulge me by answering my inquiries.
 
How active have you been in voicing your concerns to Congress and the Presidential Cabinet Members?
 
If mayors and governors are to effectively change U.S. policy to benefit local communities, how should they go about doing so? Is "pork" or earmarking effective? Or are there other methods mayors/governors and members of Congress can work together toward to better the country's cities and towns?
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this. I understand that as I am not a constituent of yours, my inquiry is not high priority, but as your reply will be of use for my research, a comment would be a welcome addition to my work. Thank you again, and I look forward to receiving any reply from you by E-mail or the address below.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
THANK YOU!!! Finally, you have pressed forward by forcing the courts to deal with the constitutionality of lethal injection by signing Clarence Hill's death warrant. I am happy to hear that this will be moving the process along. As I write this e-mail to you today, their appear to be numerous inmate's who have exhausted their appeals, in addition to Mr.Hill. Justice shall not have to take on this toll no longer. Death warrant's for the inmate's on death row must start getting signed, and these executions need to start being carried out in a timely manner. It's time that we stop letting inmate's who have exhausted their appeals process laugh in the face of Justice, and continue living off the state of Florida..
 
 I am overwhelmed by the signing of Clarence Hill's death warrant. It finally is speeding up that process to litigate these issues in the courts. Before you leave office early of January next year, please see to it that inmate's such as Danny Rolling, Mark Schwab, McArthur Breedlove, Wayne Tompkins, Ian Lightbourne, Norman Parker do have their death warrant's signed. Their appear to be more, but the above inmate's have previously lost all their regular appeals in the 11th circuit and lost successive postconviction motions in the state courts.
 
Thank you Mr.Bush

Dear Gov. Bush,

My colleagues and I at WUSF Public Broadcasting would be honored to have you as our station’s celebrity guest on the “Not My Job’’ segment for the popular National Public Radio news quiz show “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me!’’ when it visits Sarasota on Nov. 2.

The “Not My Job’’ segment, as you may know, invites well-known personalities to answer questions about topics way outside their accustomed areas of expertise. The “Not My Job’’ contestants play on behalf of a listener selected from the station’s listening area. If the contestant – you, in this case --- can come up with at least two of three correct answers, Carl Kasell will record the outgoing message on the listener’s home answering machine.

Past celebrity guests have included John McCain, Elliot Gould, Patrick Stewart, Cokie Roberts and Chris Matthews. All have had lots of fun doing the show and everyone enjoys lots of laughs in the process. Here are links to the “Wait, Wait’’ show and to a couple examples of the “Not My Job’’ segment:
 
The show’s site -- http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/ 


Tom Hanks -- http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35&prgDate=05-13-2006&view=storyview 

Brian Williams -- http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35&prgDate=06-24-2006&view=storyview 


The program will be recorded in front of a live audience at 8 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 2, at Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota, starring regular hosts Peter Sagal and Carl Kasell and familiar celebrity panelists answering questions and sharing tales about the top news of the week. Tickets to the 1,700-seat Van Wezel Hall are expected to sell out shortly after they go on sale starting tomorrow (Aug. 19).

We believe that your well-honed sense of humor, keen appreciation of news and politics, and prominent public stature as the governor of the nation’s fourth-largest state add up to make you an ideal participant in a program that is always entertaining as well as educational for its 2 million regular listeners nationwide. 

We would be honored to have you there connecting on-air with WUSF’s listening audience in West Central Florida.

Please let me know by Aug. 22 whether you would be willing to spend the evening having fun with “Wait, Wait,’’ WUSF and the National Public Radio audience so that we can begin promoting it on air. 

Thanks very much for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sir,

 

Are you aware that The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled unanimously in the Florida case "Hill v. McDonough (05-8794)," that death row inmate, Clarence Hill can challenge the lethal injection method of execution as a civil rights claim.  The court accepted Hill's appeal as he lay bound on a cross-shaped gurney for almost 2 hours with needles inserted.

 

With an appeal pending and so many unanswered questions about Florida's method of execution, why are you now re-instating the death warrant for this case?  Are you trying to prevent this man from proceeding with his claim?  

 

I would think you would be more interested in justice than in assuring that one individual gets executed.

Dear Governor Bush:

Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. Bar Association gives its unqualified and highest support for the appointment of Marie Jo Toussaint to the County Court in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County.  The Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. Bar Association ("WDFJBA"), formerly the Black Lawyers Association of Dade County, is a voluntary bar association serving Miami-Dade County's lawyers, law students and communities of African descent.  As you know, WDFJBA previously urged you to appoint Ms. Toussaint to a circuit court seat.  While we are disappointed that Ms. Toussaint did not receive your appointment at that time, we are encouraged that she has once again submitted her name for your consideration, and we see this county court appointment as another opportunity for you to appoint a highly qualified candidate to the Miami-Dade courts.

As you undoubtedly know, Ms. Toussaint is highly qualified for the position of county court judge.  During her work in the Office of the State Attorney she gained extensive experience trying cases.  Not only does she possess vast experience and a keen intellect, but Ms. Toussaint has a demonstrated commitment to public service, as evidenced by her dedicated leadership in the community.  Finally, Ms. Toussaint has a demeanor that is perfectly suited for a member of the judiciary and she is highly regarded and respected by her peers.  

Diversifying the Florida judiciary is one of the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. Bar Association's highest priority.  I understand that you share this goal. Appointing Ms. Toussaint, a Haitian-American, will be an important step in addressing the woeful under-representation of Haitian-Americans (and persons of African descent) serving on Florida's courts.




 

It is without reservation that the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. Bar Association urges the appointment of Marie Jo Toussaint to the Miami-Dade County Court.  Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this matter.

Very truly yours,

Dear Governor Bush:

For the last eight years, I have had mentees and others incarcerated 
with The Florida Department of Corrections and have been angered and 
frustrated many times due to situations which seemed patently 
inappropriate with respect to their effects on inmates, their families, 
and others who care about them.  I have made my judgments from the 
perspective of a former administrator in the department of corrections 
in another state.

In the months the James McDonough has been Secretary of Corrections, he 
has made a large number of decisions which have positively affected 
inmates, inmate families, and others who care about inmates.  The staff 
changes he has made has have a great effect ultimately on the 
responsiveness of the department and in careful attention to matters 
which truly merit genuine concern.  His actions with regard to the 
canteen contract and the inmate telephone service have already had a 
significant impact of inmates, and those who love them, and he is to be 
commended.

Far too many state departments of correction fail miserably to remember 
that inmates, although they have broken the law, are human beings and 
are precious in the eyes of Almighty God.

I know of only two really professional heads of departments of 
correlation  in the US and one of them is James McDonough and the other 
is James Donald here in Georgia!  It is interesting to note according to 
my understanding, they both have military backgrounds.

May I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your selection of Mr. 
McDonough and also suggest you should certainly congratulate him for 
doing such a splendid job!

Sincerely yours,

to discuss a matter of life or death. Unfortunately,
my family and I have exhausted all other means and you
are our last hope. Only you can make the difference.
Please allow my family and I a fifteen minute
audience.
My family and I will be eternally grateful if you can
grant us this simple wish.

Respectfully yours,


Atanaska Nikolova

Subject:	Improving the quality of life of our state's citizens

With government budgets being so tight, I was intrigued to recently learn that taxpayers and local governments across the country spend hundreds of millions of dollars per year to collect and dispose of all the bulk mail citizens typically didn’t want to receive in the first place.

That's why I was encouraged to learn about Junk Mail Awareness Week, a public education week October 1-7 that will call attention to both the numerous existing steps citizens can currently take to reduce unwanted ad mail as well as new steps that marketers and legislators could take to make opting out easier for citizens.

There are lots of facts and resources available at www.newdream.org/junkmail that could easily be used as talking points. Will you make a public statement in support of Junk Mail Awareness Week?

Subject:	Need your Guidance and Advice

Dear governor Bush,

I recently relocate to Florida with the primary intent of pushing my 
company forward, because I
thought and believe Florida would be the most ideal environment to help 
me do so.  I was quite surprise
to realized that I was in for a very rude awakening after meeting with 
individuals from Score as suggested by the
SBA who were of no help to me.  To make things matters worse, I was 
asked by the group to let them know of any available help
I may be aware of or come across because they surely cannot help.  All,  
I needed was some guidance on the various program(s)
available to small business such as ours that have been working on sweat 
equity while showing great progress.

I am aware you have busy schedule, but I am willing to drive, run, walk 
and crawl, to meet with you at any time; day or night to meet with you
or someone within your administration that can help me take this company 
to the next level.  I wish to be one of those success story that stand 
pride in the future scream from the top of my lungs, if you can't make 
it anywhere, you need to come to Florida.  I can also be reach on my 
cell at 718-490-9961. Again, I thank you for your candor.

Subject:	notary fraud

Hi, my name is Kym Brown.  I recently sent in a formal complaint involving two state notarys.  Shirleen Austin,I.D.:870221 the notary that notarized the forged document; and Carolyn J. Hamilton,I.D.1018110 the notary that forged the document.  The victims of this scam are very close to my heart.  A great injustice has been done and it should not be able to stand.  The victim Harry Lee Edwards has always been like a grandmother to me since the day we met.  She is the main reason I finished college.  She is the type of person that is always willing to lend a helping hand.  She is the last person to deserve something like this to happen to her.  I am writing to inquire about what the options would be to resolve a matter like this.  Ms. Edwards is currently in a nursing facility(Brynwood Center, Monticello, Fl.) and neither her or the other victims involved have much money for litigation.  The home is currently on the way into foreclosure and with all of the forged paperwork involved it is a struggle to get anything accomplished toward stopping it.  If the one forged document I sent along with my complaint was to be seen for the fraud it is, it would straighten out everything in one fell swoop.  When your office confirms that the document is a fraud will everything return to the way it is supposed to be or will the victims still need to hire a lawyer and are there any lawyers or programs available for indigent victims to resolve a matter of this kind?  Thak you for your time.
                                                                                    Sincerely,

Subject:	Hispanic Heritage Month Essay Contest

I am a government teacher in the Florida Public School system.  I just received the information regarding the Hispanic Heritage Month Essay Contest which requests students to write about the contributions that the Hispanic population has made to our state.  Do we have an Anglo-Saxon Heritage Month for our state to honor those of Anglo-Saxon decent and the contributions they have made?  If we do not, then let's designate such a month so that we can recognize the contributions of our Anglo-Saxon citizens, as well.  The day we get an Anglo-Saxon Heritage Month will be the day that I admonish my students to write essays about the contributions of BOTH ethnic groups.  Until then, I will not encourage students to especially recognize the contributions of one ethnic group while ignoring the contributions of another.  This business of dividing people into ethnic groups is fractionalizing our country.  If we don't stop concentrating on being hyphenated Americans, we will never think of ourselves as just Americans, and our country will continue to have problems.

       Please let me know the necessary steps I must take in order to get a special month designated to honor Anglo-Saxon Americans.

Subject:	follow up and request for action from your office

Importance:	High

Ms Rodriguez and Mr. Adams -

As a follow up to my email message to Ms. Rodriguez that the return receipt
indicated was read yesterday.

I am officially requesting that your office become involved and take a role in 
ensuring that the proper actions are taken in my dispute with the Bill Eddins, Office of the State
Attorney, District 1.

I have been more than patient and fair as I have had my rights totally trampled upon,
lost everything I own and am now in mortgage foreclosure due to the over reaching and 
prosecutorial misconduct in the District 1 office.

Briefly, I was wrongly arrested based on lies (proven in court and on video tape) in a
vicious divorce action where my wife lied about having a domestic violence injunction against
me to local law enforcememt and had me jailed when I called deputies to check on our
daugther after her mother had taken her without authorization twice before.

The charge "aggravated cyberstalking after an injunction" - again, NO INJUNCTION and not stalking.

That is when the ordeal started.

Although the prosecutor for the state told my criminal defense attorrney that she believed that the 
case was really a civil matter and that my wife had "impure motives" she HAD TO PROSECUTE me. Why? Who
knows. Perhap's because of the politicl promises of Bill Eddins and Sheriff Ron McNesby to be tough on
domestic violence offenders.

The State NEVER investigated, gathered evidence on their own or even looking into the background of the accusor.
To date she has 906 documented perscriptions over a 6 1/2 year period and our divorce Judge allowed into the record
the prescription and payment records for 654 over a 4 1/2 year period. The drugs included 4 different anti-depressents PER DAY - all completely documented and a matter of the court records now.

So the State doggedly chased these thin charges even after Judge Skievaski (our divorce Judge) stated on the record that the charges were thin at best, that I probably should never had been arrested in the first place and then he told my criminal defense attorney (who was present at one of the divore hearings) that it was a "slam dunk" for him based on the thin interpertatijn of the Statues and the lack of any evidence.

The State continued and the bottom line is that I have evidence of colusion between my wife, the prosecutor, and the Department of Children and Families to force me into PTI to get riud of me.

My wife emailed the prosecutor stating "I have the Sheriff and DCF at my house no please call me ASAP.". This was a couple of days before I was to appear against the State and deliver a "Motion to Dismiss".

Within no time the prosecutor emailed my attorney and stated "I'm thinking about revoking your clients bond and having him arrested based on a conversatino overheard by a DCF investigator." Although a report from DCF is cited in her email, and mentioned her motion to revoke bond (and stated it was attached to the motion)it was NOT ATTACHED or ever produced to anyone since it never actually existed! The only report to come from DCF was several weeks after the incidents and the incident was "no findings" - essentially stating nothing improper occured. 

The next day the Judge who was obviously showing favortism to the prosecutor stated she would not entertain or review the Motion because "the State says it is improperly formed" - this effectively removed my legal options and forced me to take PTI under threat of jail time. I entered into the program and immediately set out to clear my name.

The prosecutor is guilty of hiding evidence, obscuring facts and trampling on my rights by attempting to revoke my bond and have me arrested on a non-existent report to force me to enter PTI and hid her abuses.

The State continues to refuse to give me their copies of emails between the parties first stating they had no records of any emails (althoug I have many) then claiming they were deleted because they were transitory in nature.

Because of these glaring abuses and the trampling of my rights I have been forced to put up a website (www.billcagle.com), have made a formal complaint to the Florida Commission on Ethics, have filed a complaint against the prosecutor with the Florida Bar and contacted the Florida and National offices of the ACLU. In addition I have sent information to several media outlets and requested coverage.

My purpose is to make the people responsible for these abuses be held accountable for their actions and their arrogant actions be made public.

My hopes is that the glaring light of public eyes on these abuses will somehow spark external intervention and oversight of investigations by office like yours.

I am now officially requesting contact and assistance from your office.

I look forawrd to hearing from your soon. I can be reached at 850-324-3107.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Discrimination and the Sunshine Law in Wakulla Co.

Governor Bush and Senator Lawson,
 
    My name is Daniel Thompson and I have Multiple Sclerosis and live in Sopchoppy.  On July 17, 2006, the Wakulla County Board of Commissioners voted 3-2 to restrict the broadcast of the "Citizens to be Heard" portion of the commission meeting on Comcast C-Span channel, restraining public sentiment.
    This directly affects the disabled and elderly citizens of this county.  It is the intention of the BOCC to further restrict the ability of the citizen to be placed on the agenda of the BOCC meetings.  A workshop will be held on Aug. 21 to discuss these further restrictions.  It is advertised and titled agenda, not indicating the seriousness of the workshop.
   
    I have had 3 min. for a redress of my grievances concerning this issue of broadcast. Two commissioners spoke briefly with me on this subject, one spoke with me on another issue and said we would talk about broadcast later, two have not responded to my attempts to contact them.  I have also written a letter (attached to this email) to them referencing the Sunshine State Law, The Disabilities Act of 1990, and historical literature on the importance and foundation of local government, only one commissioner has responded.  
 
    Of the two that voted against the restriction of broadcast, one commissioner released the very next day, an e-mail statement praising the decision of the board and listed the ability of the citizen to get on the meeting agenda as a disadvantage.  One would wonder for whom is this a disadvantage and why would you praise a decision you voted against.  I know,  his voting record may be in question when running for higher office in two years and a vote to restrain public sentiment would reflect negatively on his campaign.
 
    I contend this decision to restrict broadcast is a violation of the Sunshine State Law, Florida State Constitution and negatively affects the disabled, elderly, and all the citizens of Wakulla. My intentions are to have a true "open government".   The State Attorney Willie Meggs is investigating a possible violation of the Sunshine Law by a board member, and I would like him to also determine if restriction of broadcast is a violation.
 
    I been approached and  encouraged by many citizens(over 60 now and counting) and only three agreed with the decision of the board.  Only after trying to take this matter up with the board over the last five weeks and nearly being ignored,  I bring this issue to the state level.
 
    Please contact me, I would appreciate your insight on this issue.
 
                                                            Thank you, Daniel Thompson

Florida has one of the largest representations of NAF academies in the United States.  On November 15 -18 NAF will be having an Academy Leadership Summit in Orlando. Over 500 educators, administrators and industry partners from around the United States will be attending.  I was wondering if at any time during those dates if you would be available to give a 30 minute presentation on your views of academy programs and where you see the direction of Education in the State of Florida. We certainly can accommodate your schedule based on availability.

 

These programs fit right in with you’re A+++ requirements and we are in line with the direction the nation is progressing when it comes to academies. NAF academies are leading the nation in curriculum rigor and relevance and student who participate in a career focused program have graduation rates that are higher then a traditional setting. Anyway, if you are available we would enjoy having you participate. If you have any questions I can be reached at 407-317-3200 ext 2690. Thank you for your consideration of my request.

Dear Governor,
       Valerie Frederica Brown has been selected as one of the finalists for a judgeship on the 18th Judicial Circuit.
   As a Guardian Ad Litem, I have been many times in front of General Magistrate Brown in Dependency Court in Brevard County.  I have found her to be exactly as a judge SHOULD be - impartial though sympathetic, and always ruling according to the law.  She has always been "up" on the laws, and most times is way ahead of the DCF or contract attorneys in the changes to dependency law.
   She has the experience, knowledge and character necessary for a Judge, and I would heartily recommend her.

Subject:	BOT business

Dear Mr. Bush:

 

I am happy to have the chance to send this information to you for your attention. Florida is developing very quickly in the recent 10 years, especially in the period under your excellent leadership.

We thank you and your brother very much for all you have done for this country.

 

My personal business friends in Shanghai just told me that they want to find some business opportunities in Florida. The business is called BOT (Build Own Transfer).

They want to find some construction projects here in Florida that they can join. They will provide the necessary capital to support big projects in Florida and they do not wish to be shareholders.

 

Simply speaking, the nature and conditions of the business are as the following:

 

1)       The project investment target normally needs to be larger than 100 million U.S. dollars

2)       30% to 35% of the investment needs to be purchasing orders to companies in China (either material or labor)

3)       The project must be secured by Federal Government or a credible bank to guarantee the payment back

4)       The interest rate is about 5.0% plus some managerial cost, and the total rate is usually between 7 to 9%.

5)       The pay back period / term is negotiable.

 

If you know any construction development projects (Like highway, bridges, ports, big warehouses, social benefit residential buildings, water systems, etc.) in Florida that can use this BOT paradigm and really benefit Floridians, please let me know. I can discuss the matter with you or your assistant anytime.

 

Best regards!

Dear Governor Bush:

By way of introduction, my name is Eric Molina, and I am a commercial litigator in Lee County, Florida.  I am pleased to endorse Tara's campaign for Lee County Judge.

Tara has both the temperament and ability ideal for the county bench.  She has considerable experience in criminal and civil proceedings.  She is a Florida Supreme Court certified mediator, and she has volunteered as a hearing examiner in child support enforcement proceedings.  Moreover, as demonstrated by her career and community involvement, she is committed to public service.

Earlier this summer, Tara was selected by the Twentieth Judicial Circuit Judicial Nominating Committee as a finalist for the vacancy created by Judge Volz's appointment to the circuit bench.  I sincerely hope that you will favorably consider Tara's qualifications and appoint her to the vacant seat.  I am confident that her service as a county judge will honor you.

Respectfully,

Subject:	[*] Re: Appointment to FL. Medical Board

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I have contacted your office numerous times to be considered for an appointment to the Florida Board of Medicine. I believe our medical profession is in need of some leadership in order to preserve the trust of the people we serve, I am committed to using educational tools to modify and improve physician behavior and competence. I have exceptional qualifications and experience. I am a Clinical (Voluntary) Professor of Medicine at the University of Miami School of Medicine. I am bilingual and speak and understand Spanish. I also believe physicians need to think out of the box when it comes to assisting in disaster relief. The impact that one physician can have will benefit our citizens. Moreover, I know from several of my friends that the Board needs help and probable cause panel is inundated with cases. I have been in practice for over 30 years and have had an excellent track record as a physician in my field as noted. I would appreciate it very much if you would consider me for an appointment to the Board of Medicine. I would like an opportunity to serve the Board and be able to contribute in some small way to the improvement of our health care system for our citizens. I am in favor adding reference to §766.115(3)(2)(e)(2), F.S. regarding volunteer service guidelines. I am also in favor of providing Board Authority to Require Provider Competency (Ortiz Opinion) The Board proposes language to correct the unsafe situation created by the Ortiz decision. That decision would prevent the Board from taking action on physicians who delegate medical care to persons who are not competent to perform them or are services which the physician is not competent to supervise the performance of. 

 

 

Please call me at (305) 778-7243 or my offices at (305) 956-9062 ask for Lori she is my office manager.

Gov. Bush,

 

The word “hero” is defined as a “person of courage and accomplishment” in Webster’s Dictionary.  For United Cerebral Palsy of Central Florida, twenty-one-year-old Krista Pohorenec is our definition of hero.

 

On Saturday, September 30, Krista will swim from Alcatraz Island to San Francisco Aquatic Park to help raise awareness for early intervention services for children with special needs.

 

Diagnosed with Down syndrome at birth, she is also using her love for swimming as a tool to help raise funds for UCP of Central Florida, an organization she holds near and dear to her heart.

 

Krista sees the Alcatraz swim as an opportunity to make a difference and educate parents on the importance of seeking early intervention services for their children. But for Krista, the Alcatraz swim is just the beginning.

 

She is an extraordinary individual who works hard to give back to those who are in need as she once was. One day a week, she volunteers as a teacher’s aid at one of UCP of Central Florida’s Child Development Centers.  And she wants to become a motivational speaker to help create a better world for all people, with and without disabilities.

 

“Krista is a remarkable young lady who has already succeeded in living a purposeful and goal-oriented life,” says Ilene Wilkins CEO/President of UCP of Central Florida.  “She has a positive impact on everyone she meets, inspiring us all to realize our own untapped potential.”

 

We realize your schedule is very tight and a personal visit to wish her luck may not be possible. However, would you be able to send a personal letter to Krista acknowledging her desire to help children with special needs and congratulating her on her accomplishments?

 
Please address the letter to Krista Pohorenec and mail it to my attention at:

 

UCP of Central Florida

3305 S. Orange Ave.

Orlando, FL 32806

 

We will be happy to have UCP’s CEO or even a local representative present the letter to her on your behalf if you desire.  If you are able to meet with Krista as she departs for her journey to swim Alcatraz, she would be more than honored. Please contact me at 407-852-3305 or 407-721-5490 and I will be happy to help make this happen.

 

Again, Krista is a very passionate and personable individual and I appreciate your time and assistance in helping show Krista how much she means to UCP.

 

Sincerely,

Five years ago on September 11, 2001, the heart of a nation was broken.  While mourning the deaths of many Americans, a surge of patriotism swept through our country.  While this patriotism would not dry the tears or heal the wounds, we were united as a country whose sole purpose is freedom.  Join with Ocoee High School’s premiere ensemble Excalibur as well as many guest artists on Sept 11, 2006 as we celebrate freedom, honor and remember those who sacrificed all on that infamous day, and look forward to the promise of a better future in this great nation of ours through a musical tribute we entitled “FREEDOM.”

Subject:	[*] death penalty

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 This is absolutely ridiculous. I find it a complete outrage that inmate's who have been on death row for the past 3 damn decades without a new trial or new sentencing hearing are still languishing on death row filing these meaningless appeals. You are by far the best Governor Florida has ever had, and I commend you on all your great accomplishment's. One of those was by signing into law the death penalty reform act of 2000. The Florida Supreme Court quashed the new law to speed up death penalty appeals, and I find that utterly repulsive. The idea of an innocent person getting executed keeps coming up. I am so tired of hearing that. It is the legislatures duty to amend the laws. In this case, the legislature actually did the right thing, a bill passed that would have reduced the number of years an inmate has spent on death row from 14 to 5. Florida needs to start taking after Virginia in carrying out it's executions if you ask me. I understand you only have to January in office. Right now I would ask that you respectfully sign the death warrants, for which your assosciates have not rightfully provided you with. A couple months ago during Clarence Hill's pending execution, where it was later stayed you were quoted as saying "I don't think any are ripe anyway" in referring to the signing of death warrants as it relates to certain cases. Unfortunately, there are dozens on death row who have long been through with their appeals before Clarence Hill and Arthur Rutherford. I will name them later. Right now, I'de like to talk about the future of Florida. You are leaving office in January and I find it urgent that someone like you does something as it regards the appeals limited to death row inmates. Where do these low-class human beings get off suing the state for amending our laws to shorten the time to their execution. It's punishment for their crime. There should be NO LAWSUITS, no challenges. Sometimes you just have to take what you get, and these inmates come off threatening to sue the state because we cut off their appeals. This has to stop. The Victims and their families have been on the receiving end of this trauma to long Governor Bush. I respectfully ask you to act NOW on this issue before it is to late. 
 
As far as death warrants go, executions are proceeding in other states. The U.S Supreme Court specifically made it clear in their ruling that not all executions would be stayed just due to legal challenges to lethal injection. Clarence Hill won a stay of execution, fortunately for him and Rutherford, and Hill won. Hill has the right to pursue a civil lawsuit challenging lethal injection. The high court stated their must be clear proof for a challenge to lethal injection to be granted. I therefore respectfully ask you sign the death warrants for which your person who handles death penalty appeals has not told you about...
 
Jeffrey Atwater, McArthur Breedlove (on death row since 1979 and has lost all appeals),Jim Chandler,Angel Diaz,Charles Foster,Guy Gamble (pending disposition of certiorari petition to U.S Supreme Court),Norman Parker,William Kelley,Cary Lambrix,Ian Lightbourne,John Marek, John Marquard,Domibnick Occhicone (pending disposition of certiorari petition),Sonny Oats,Kenneth Quince,Danny Rolling,Mark Schwab,Paul Scott,Wayne Tompkins,Manuel Valle (pending disposition of certiorari petition),William Van Poyck, Peter Ventura,Johnny Williamson,Edward Zakrzewski, and lastly William Zeigler (on death row since 1976). Each and every one of the names I have just provided you have LOST their appeals in the 11th circuit, which is every states last major avenue of relief as it concerns the death penalty appeals. Right now most of the above inmate's have meritless postconviction motions pending which are undoubtedly going to be denied. One inmate has an appeal pending saying that Roper V Simmons should apply to him even though he was 18 years and 8 months old. Another one of those inmate's has filed an appeal on how Roper should apply to him even though he was 23 when he commited the crime, he has the mental age of a juvenile, or 10 year old. These are unworthy appeals up for review, and no relief is going to come out of filing such unworthy, useless appeals. The Florida Supreme Court has gone to far with this issue. The above inmate's need their death warrant's signed. I have studied the death penalty for years, and in any other state, those inmates would have been executed decades ago after the court of appeals ruled on their issues. I respectfully ask that you reverse your decision in not signing any death warrants (as I'm sure these executions would be carried out), and sign the name's above up for execution in a timely manner. The person who handles the death penalty appeals for you has not been keeping track of these very well if he/she sees Arthur Rutherford or Clarence Hill up for execution before the other names on that list. Most of those inmates have filed at least 5 Postconviction successive motions which were all denied and have been on death row since the 70's, and still continue to file those meritless appeals..
 
Please see to it something get's done expeditously. Thank you
 
-- If Governor Bush does not actually read his e-mail's, I would ask that you please see to it that he is fully aware of the name's I have provided. Those ARE inmate's whose date with the executioner can very well be carried out if a death warrant is signed.

I'm not sure I understand...why exactly was QBE unable to renew the insurance coverage for our condominium building?  How much profit is enough?  Whatever happened to good corporate citizenship?

 

Please call a Special Session to develop and enact some meaningful legislation that will help lower our outrageous insurance premiums!

 

Thank you for your attention to this serious problem.

 

Sincerely,

Mr. Jeb Bush,
 
I currently find myself in a unique situation in which only you can help!! I am young man with a family whom I love and need to support. My education and character opens the doors to the best jobs in my area only to have the door slammed on my dreams by HR for a piece of paper they see, my criminal history.
 
On February 14, 1999, when attending the University of Central Florida, I was headed home for the weekend to visit my family and fiancé. On this trip I took an acquaintance who lived above my apartment. On the way home he wanted to stop by one of his friends house and here is were he committed a robbery. I did not take part in this crime in any way, shape, or form. I also did not know that this was his intension. I was charged with Accomplice After The Fact.
 
Over ten years ago I was at a Miami Hurricane's football were I jumped over a gate. I was arrested and my parents had this charge expunged. It was the first time I was arrested and my parents and I did not know the law. I look back and now know that an expunge should only be used on charges that will hinder life opportunities. 
 
Mr. Bush, please help me in correcting an error the justice system made several years ago, but affects my everyday.
 
Thank you for your time,

Raul Gomez

Subject:	Illegal Immigrants

(This story puts an interesting perspective on the illegal immigration
issue!!)

A lady wrote the best letter in the Editorials in ages!! It explains
things better than all the balderdash you hear on TV.


Recently large demonstrations have taken place across the country
protesting the fact that Congress is finally addressing the issue of
illegal immigration. Certain people are angry that the US might protect
its own borders, might make it harder to sneak into this country and,
once here, to stay indefinitely. Let me see if I correctly understand
the thinking behind these protests.

Let's say I break into your house. Let's say that when you discover me
in your house, you insist that I leave. But I say, "I've made all the
beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors;
I've done all the things you don't like to do. I'm hard-working and
honest (except for when I broke into your house).

According to the protesters, not only must you let me stay, you must add
me to your family's insurance plan, educate my kids, and provide other
benefits to me and to my family (my husband will do your yard work
because he too is hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in
part. 

If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my friends
who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my right to be
there. It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than
I do, and I'm just trying to better myself. I'm hard-working and honest,
um, except for well, you know. 

And what a deal it is for me!! I live in your house, contributing only a
fraction of the cost of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about
it without being accused of selfishness, prejudice and being
anti-housebreaker. 

Oh yeah, and I want you to learn my language so you can communicate with
me

Why can't people see how ridiculous this is?! 

Only in America....if you agree, pass it on (in English).

Subject:	Article about crime from the Orlando Sentinel

I thought the attached article from the Orlando Sentinel from last Saturday would be of interest.

Best,

John Peyton

Mayor

Is crime crackdown the answer? 

Jacksonville's fight against its murder wave may be a model for Orlando.

Jim Leusner

Sentinel Staff Writer

August 13, 2006

JACKSONVILLE -- It started with the Jan. 3 death of Donte Chapman, a 20-year-old man found shot, burned and dumped in a field -- one of 14 murder victims in the first month of the year.

Consoling the boy's mother, pastor Mark Griffin knew things had to change in his city -- which for years has been dubbed "Florida's murder capital." So Griffin and others in the AME Ministerial Alliance partnered with police and then started walking neighborhoods on their own, talking about crime in the community and even offering cash for guns.

As the city of Orlando faces its deadliest year in history -- with 37 murders to date -- it might look to Jacksonville, where city, law-enforcement, business, faith and community leaders have rallied to attack the rising body count.

In May, 13-year-old honor student Shenice Holmes was killed by a stray bullet while reading in her bedroom. The outrage in the black community was palpable. Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford announced Operation Safe Streets, a multiagency task force aimed at guns, drugs and violent offenders.

The community's breaking point, it seems, came July 26, when 8-year-old DreShawna Davis was killed -- again by a stray bullet -- while playing a video game in her grandmother's home.

"DreShawna Davis was our flash point," Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton said. "The community said enough is enough. Her life was snuffed out for no reason."

To date, the city of 840,000 has tallied 79 murders -- 31 more than this time last year. For all of 2005, the city had 91 slayings.

Ways to fight back

Jacksonville is throwing everything it has into the battle against urban violence. And it's not just politicians' promises and prayer groups:

The mayor and City Council have pledged $5 million in police overtime to add 70 officers in the city's most dangerous neighborhoods.

Peyton appealed to Gov. Jeb Bush, who sent $32,000 to fund Operation Road Block North, which brings troopers to the city on weekends this month.

The mayor has reached out to 550 faith organizations to help promote "Walking Wednesdays," where he, police and residents tour neighborhoods to help improve relations.

Members of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce are pledging $200,000 to help the Sheriff's Office pay rewards up to $1,000 to citizens who report criminals armed with guns.

If Jacksonville's business community -- the city is a regional banking and insurance center pushing to attract more high-tech companies -- doesn't address violence and murder, and do something to help, "it could have a chilling effect on business and people wanting to come to Jacksonville," said Steve Halverson, a construction-company executive leading the chamber fundraising effort. "It's intolerable from a businessman's perspective. . . . And sometimes, you need a crisis to wake people up."

Orlando's Regional Chamber of Commerce doesn't see its role that way, its president said.

"That's not our mission at all," said Jacob Stuart, chamber president. "Our mission is to lead a regional visioning exercise." The chamber once had a crime-prevention committee. But that, he said, is "ancient history."

On Friday, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said he will launch a task force designed to find new ways to combat the city's crime wave. It will be asked to develop a plan using police, volunteer and community resources to reduce crime.

"We're solving the crimes after they occur. The issue is, how can we be effective at preventing the crime?" Dyer said. " . . . It's going to take more than the Orlando Police Department to solve the crime problem."

Turning tide in community

Jacksonville's sheriff thinks his city needs a community backlash against criminals to succeed in its anti-crime response. Violent crimes overall are down in Jacksonville during the past 15 years, and law-enforcement members are confounded by the jump in murders this year. They want residents to report criminal activity and identify people with guns.

"That collective intolerance is the only thing that can stop this violence," Rutherford said. "If you act like a thug, the community is going to come after you -- and the police are coming with them."

Governor Jeb Bush;

 

I am writing this letter on behalf of Judicial Candidate Cristina Miranda. It is my understanding that Cristina is being considered for appointment by you for a position as a county court Judge in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida. Even though you may consider my opinion biased, I think Ms. Miranda's strong ethical, moral, and honest beliefs would make an outstanding judge.

  

I have been a Miami-Dade Police Officer for thirteen years. For the past two years, I have been assigned to the Strategic and Specialized Investigations Bureau, Organized Crime Section, Vice Squad.  During this period I have dealt nearly exclusively with Cristina for the preparation and the prosecution of the cases I investigate.  My responsibilities as an investigator includes;  Organized Prostitution, Organized Gambling, Human Trafficking, Juvenile Prostitution, Murder-for-Hire, Murder Conspiracy, Extortion, Racketeering, and RICO.  I'm also assigned to the South Florida Human Trafficking Task Force. Throughout my tenure in the Organized Crime Section I have always requested Cristina's legal guidance for the successful prosecution of my cases.  Cristina can always be counted on 24/7.  Cristina always makes effective decisions based on her strong ethical, moral, and honest beliefs. Her dedication to her job is second-to-none; as I have had to, on very frequent occasions, call upon her late nights and weekends, for advice, and at times, response to scenes. Cristina is a fearless prosecutor whose career speaks for itself.   Having the opportunity to work with Cristina when dealing both with subjects and victims, has truly been a learning experience. I have known very few people who can show the maximum compassion, whether it is to a victim or offender, when making decisions which adversely or positively affect the rest of that person's life.

 

It has and continues to be one of the greatest privileges of my career to work with and learn from Cristina. She is an individual who would make an outstanding judge.  If I can be of any assistance to you in this matter, or any other, please feel free to contact me.

Subject:	"Mentoring Success"

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Nancy Ballard.  I am a Human Service Counselor III with the State of Florida Department of Health located at the Orange County Health Department in Orlando.  It is widely known that your administration has placed great emphasis on improving the educational standards for the children of Florida.

 

During the 2005-2006 school year,  the employees at my office were encouraged by our health unit director, Dr. Kevin Sherin, to volunteer as mentors at one of our local elementary schools.  This particular school, Ivey Lane Elementary School, had just received a second “F” rating.  Through the encouragement of Dr. Sherin and that school’s principal, Dr. Ruth Baskerville, 55 of our employees signed on as mentors.  This included personnel from the highest level of administration to entry level clerical positions.  They undertook this challenge with the goal of bringing Ivey Lane out of the “F” category.  Ivey Lane students adopted as their motto, “From Ivey Lane to Ivey League”. At the end of the school year, not only did Ivey Lane come out of the “F” category, they improved TWO letter grades to a “C”.  Most of these children come from low income families, many below poverty level.  Their parents were included in the process and were motivated just as the children.  They became an integral part of the solution.

 

This particular school has been blessed with a dynamic, highly motivated, selfless principal.  She has the ability to inspire the desire for success in all that she meets.  She challenges all to come on board and to become a part of the solution.  Dr. Baskerville, in turn, has been blessed with a very talented, compassionate staff who has taken to heart improving the educational status and the lives of these very special children.  These individuals have given of their personal time (evenings and weekends), resources, and hearts to help these kids.  The children have in turn responded with improved grades, and ultimately, the chance for brighter and more successful futures.

 

I would like to ask if there is a chance that you could acknowledge their hard work by awarding them a U.S. or a Florida flag that has flown over the State Capitol in Tallahassee that they could take pride in flying over their school as a daily symbol of their successful efforts?  I know that it would mean the world to them.  It would be immensely meaningful if you or Lt. Governor Jennings could present it to them in person during one of your scheduled visits to the Orlando area.  

 

These children and this dedicated staff of educators will strive to go forward in their quest to be the best that they can be.  I respectfully ask for your help in motivating them to reach for the stars in their educational journey.

 

Most sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:

First of all, I will like to congratulate you and your team for the excellent job done in our state. My name is Dario Rivera a resident of Coral Springs, FL since 1994. The reason why I am contacting you is because I am currently finishing my Bachelors degree at Barry University and with only four classes left to accomplish that goal, one of my classes (Health Law) request is to interview a current or future Florida politician and I could not think about a better person than you. 

Since I live in South Florida, the interview process could be via e-mail and will consist of only 5 questions which will be provided to you once you confirm that you can spend a few minutes helping me accomplish the mentioned task.  If you agree to help me, the only request I have from my professor, other than the 5 questions if some kind of document showing that the answers are coming from you which it could be a letter with your letterhead and signature. The project due date is September 8th. 

I will like to thank you in advance for your time.

The interview would consist of about 10-12 questions and would certainly be of interest to our nation.

If you are open to this please contact me and I will draw up the questions.

Gov. Jeb,
 
Having Congressman Bilirakis officially introduce me to you at the BryCoat Plant this afternoon was indeed an honor.  I just want to take this opportunity to thank you.  Thank you for being such a great governor and one who is proving to be a very "tough act to follow." Thank you for enacting so many good and sound policies that have assured our state a continued bright future, so long as we stay the course.  I also thank you for how you convey your messages.  This afternoon, espousing the many irrefutable Republican accomplishments in such a rightfully proud and an unapologetic way is what we need to hear more of; what the voters need to know.  
 
My husband and I whole heartily agree how much you'll be missed.  You have set high the bar.  My thanks for being the driving force in making this state of Florida greater, and a really great place to live.  
 
Just another citizen proud of her governor,

Attorney General Gonzales remains utterly neglectful of addressing the rampant corruption exposed by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) in its devastating report released March 14th of this year. The GAO charges the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—the agency of the Department of Homeland Security that would oversee any guest worker amnesty program—with failed organizational infrastructure, and massive mismanagement and corruption. Yet the Attorney General wants to expand the duties and responsibilities of this organization to process millions more illegal intruders through the system. 

“This GAO report was commissioned by the U.S. Congress and it was part of an investigation that started immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attack. 

“Among the GAO's most alarming findings were that 33 percent of “religious worker” visas were issued fraudulently. The GAO documents evidence that radical Islamists, with ties to terrorist organizations, have used the religious worker visa category to gain admission to the United States. 

“The Copley News Service reported on March 7th, 2006, that ‘Michael Maxwell stepped down last month as Director of the Office of Security at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and sought protection under the federal whistle-blower protection law. He claims that senior agency officials had been retaliating against him for telling Congress about what he described as serious national security vulnerabilities that persisted despite his warnings to those running the agency.’ 

“In addition, Maxwell claims that the agency lacks the resources to handle some 500 allegations of criminal misconduct against agency employees, including allegations of espionage and acceptance of bribes. 

“The GAO report documents that immigration benefit fraud was pervasive and significant and the approach to controlling it was fragmented. In one of the largest labor—that means guest worker—certification fraud schemes ever uncovered by the GAO, federal investigators found evidence that a single prominent immigration attorney in the Washington, D.C., area submitted at least 1,436 and perhaps as many as 2,700 fraudulent employment applications between 1998 and 2002. 

“The GAO found that the USCIS is completely unprepared to handle their present 7.5 million case work load with their 3,000 employees. Few if any of the present 500 allegations of criminal misconduct against agency employees will ever be prosecuted. 

“And the GAO also conclusively found that the agency as it stands will be unable to handle the proposed guest worker amnesty proposals bandied about by the Bush administration, the Senate and now the nation’s premiere law enforcement officer. 

“Attorney General Gonzales would be well advised to focus his attention on his own back yard—clean up the rampant fraud and corruption in the USCIS—and prosecute those who have broken our laws in the immigration system before crossing the country with a charm offensive to promote mass amnesty. Amnesty places millions ahead of the REAL citizenship queue—the one that waits years and years OUTSIDE of the promised land of America. It is patently inequitable and unjust to reward those illegally jumping that line with “sweetheart citizenship” papers that lets them cut ahead of the law-abiding in becoming Americans. 

“These illegal migrants have not only broken laws including document fraud, identity theft and income tax evasion, but they have enjoyed the benefits of being in America years ahead of law-abiding applicants waiting for visas and earning citizenship as my wife and I did. The Attorney General has no moral ground to stand on to talk to me and millions more like me about American immigrant values, hard work, and fairness. Whatever happened to equity under the law?”

STATEMENT OF AL GARZA ON ALBERTO GONZALES AMNESTY SPEECH 

SANTA CLARA, CA (July 21, 2006)—Al Garza, National Executive Director of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps (“MCDC”), released the following statement at a press conference on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales’s pro-amnesty speech today in Santa Clara, California: 

“As this nation’s highest-ranking law enforcement officer, it is inexcusable that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales would promote a blanket amnesty for people who have committed such felonies as document fraud, identity theft and income tax evasion, and all based solely upon some special status that their illegal entrance into this country and their national origin has somehow allegedly conferred. Their very first act on American soil was to break federal law by entering this country illegally. 

“This selective amnesty being proposed by Attorney General Gonzales to excuse millions of NON-CITIZENS from their commission of serious felonies, while American CITIZENS continue to be held accountable under applicable statutes, is unconstitutional. Mr. Gonzales’ familiarity with 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection clause means he understands that point of law. There is no amnesty being offered to those American citizens who have committed document fraud, identity theft or income tax evasion—apparently only illegal border crossers. But Lady Justice is represented wearing a blindfold for a reason, and that reason is the equality of all persons before the law. 

“Furthermore, any proposal for amnesty in the guise of ‘guest worker permit path to citizenship’ is a national security risk that is already causing a human tsunami across our unsecured borders for those seeking to ‘get in under the wire.’ In some of the areas the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps has stood watch, the numbers of people crossing the borders illegally have increased tenfold since the talk of amnesty began last year. This wave of illegal migrants is exploiting the black market document underground in anticipation of new amnesty programs—and conceals in its sea of humanity all sorts of criminal and even terrorist elements. I am sure in these days of Middle Eastern violence, our wide-open borders are a fact that has not escaped the notice of Hezbollah, Lebanon, Syria and Iran. 

“The critical need is to secure this nation's borders with federal troops immediately. There is no conflict in doing so with the Posse Comitatus Act, as the war zone that is America’s southern frontier and the wide-open northern border do not represent a law enforcement matter—but a clear matter of national security. 

“Mexico’s government has created a majestic disconnect between the wealthy and the peasant by deliberate design. Their failure to organize, demand and promote fair and balanced economic and social opportunities has led to Mexican citizens fleeing their homeland for America by the millions. 

“With already overburdened public services, medical facilities, welfare programs, criminal incarcerations and public education systems, Attorney General Gonzales demands his fellow Americans ignore his direct assault on the rule of law and our national security, become complicit in Mexico’s degradation, and subsidize an unending flow of slave-wage labor into this country. Caesar Chavez had it right when he fought so hard to stop this exploitation. 

“We are a compassionate nation and believe in fairness, and in that fairness American citizens are first demanding enforcement of our laws. Illegal migrants should not be given preferential rights and liberties after knowingly committing felonies. Special treatment, in such a case, is simply unacceptable, with laws that apply only to some and not to others because they share an ethnicity with our Attorney General. 

“Neither should the poorest of the poor be enticed to come here illegally or legally to be exploited like pack-mules. We are a nation founded on human equality, not indentured servitude. The current ‘guest-worker’ proposals are an affront to American principles of social justice and the rights and duties of citizenship. 

“We have had promises of border security tied to amnesty after amnesty after amnesty. The American people no longer trust our government to secure the borders. Congress and the Bush administration first need to prove that they have competently secured our borders against foreign incursion and are protecting America’s security and sovereignty. Only then we will deliberate about what to do with those millions already here illegally.”

Subject:	DOT Office of Inspector General Update--Laptop Theft
Attachments:	Aug14064a.pdf

We wanted to provide you with an update (please see the attached word document) on the status of our investigation and follow-up activities regarding the recent theft in Miami of an Office of Inspector General (OIG) laptop computer that contained personally identifiable information (PII).    

We also wanted to give you a heads-up on something else we are doing.  Tonight we talked to reporters from the Miami Herald and the Washington Post about a second laptop that was stolen in April, 2006 at our 4th biennial fraud prevention conference in Orlando, Florida.  We told the reporters that we have broadened our investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Miami loss to include this earlier theft of a laptop from another Miami-based OIG agent.  

That agent, who heads up our Miami office and was organizing this conference, reported that the laptop was stolen from a locked meeting room.  At the time, we understood that this laptop, which was password protected, contained conference-related power-point presentations and materials, all which were publicly releasable.  This occurred before the Department of Veterans Affairs incident raised awareness of the PII issue and, at the time, we treated this as a theft of property.  Notifications were made to local law enforcement and within OIG.  This was the first laptop ever reported stolen or missing from an OIG investigator.  (Note: Several years ago, one of our audit staff reported that a laptop was stolen from a hotel room.) 

In response to the loss of the Miami laptop and its PII, we decided to revisit this earlier theft.  We are in the process of more precisely determining what information was on the laptop stolen in Orlando.  We identified a back up of this laptop's hard drive and are currently performing an examination to determine what was on the laptop.  This analysis is ongoing and we will keep you informed and make any notifications, as appropriate, should we determine that the stolen laptop contained PII material.

       CONGRESSIONAL UPDATE

August 14, 2006



Dear Members and staff of the Florida Delegation, other interested congressional committees, and Governor Bush: 

We are providing the following update on the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General activities regarding the reported theft of a laptop computer belonging to an OIG special agent in Miami, FL on July 27, 2006.


Response to Florida Members of Congress 
Letter to Acting Inspector General 

On August 11, 2006, 16 Members of the Florida congressional delegation sent a letter to the Acting Inspector General, expressing their concerns about the loss of personally identifiable information of Florida residents, especially in light of other recent data thefts at other Federal Agencies.  The Members requested a "detailed description of current procedures and protocol in handling this type of information and what steps and specific protocols are being implemented to ensure a massive breach does not occur again".

In response, the OIG is drafting a letter that will assure the Members that we will report to them the results of (1) our investigation of the incident, (2) our review of the adequacy of policies compared to existing requirements and whether our policies were appropriately followed, and (3) actions taken to strengthen our policies and controls to ensure that no similar incident can occur in the future.  We plan to enlist the help of an outside contractor with expertise in computer security and privacy requirements to assist in the review of our policies and the development of new policies, as appropriate.  We will also provide periodic progress updates to the Department and interested congressional staff.

Our current efforts are focused on: 

Recovery Efforts 

*       We have a team of approximately 15 investigators on the ground in Miami.  They are working with the Miami/Dade County police and other law enforcement agencies, which have provided important assistance in efforts to recover the stolen laptop. 

*       OIG investigators and local police have conducted more than 500 field interviews. 
*       We have handed out over 600 fliers announcing the reward for and providing a description of the laptop (including its serial number) to police stations, pawnshops, and used computer stores in the Miami area.

*       OIG investigators and local police have visited more than 350 pawnshops in the Dade County area. 
*       OIG investigators and local police visited 12 flea markets on Saturday, August 12th. 
*       We reviewed the stolen/recovered property inventories for 8 local police agencies in the area and the Florida Highway Patrol.

*       Via our website, we have directed victims to call our hotline to receive tips and advice on how to check their credit.  As of Monday morning, we had received a total of 311 calls.  Several calls provided tips which we have actively followed up on.  

*       We have offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the laptop's recovery and posted this on our website along with a description of the laptop and contact information.  


Public Outreach 

*       OIG has posted open letters on our website for Florida residents who had certain PII information contained on the laptop.  The letters are written in both English and Spanish.

*       We are mailing out personal letters to individuals beginning August 15th to notify them of this situation and provide information on actions that they can take to prevent identity theft.     

*       We have recommended that affected individuals: contact one of the three major credit reporting bureaus to request that an initial fraud alert be placed on their credit record (which entitles them to one free credit report form each company); monitor bank and credit card statements and contact financial institutions to check for any suspicious activity on their accounts; be vigilant to any phone calls, e-mails, and other communications from individuals purporting to be government officials and "phishing" for or asking to verify personal information.   

*       We are encouraging anyone who suspects they may be the victim of identify theft to contact our hotline (1-800-424-9071), 24 hours a day.

*       We are working with the General Services Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs to obtain information on credit monitoring services. 


OIG Actions 

*       Once we obtained confirmation that the stolen Miami laptop contained PII information, we began to undertake our own investigation to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss of this laptop as well as what follow-up actions were taken.  We have two agents assigned full-time to this investigation.    

*       On August 3, OIG investigators agents were instructed not to leave government laptops unattended in their vehicles, even if the vehicle is locked. All electronic storage media must be kept out of site. Any loss of computers or electronic storage media must immediately be reported to OIG HQ management and information security staff.

*       On August 7, all OIG employees were instructed to remove all PII data from laptops and to ensure that all sensitive data is stored in encrypted folders. OIG managers are being directed to review the content of their employees' laptops and obtain a certification from each employee that their laptop does not contain PII.

*       On August 14, the Acting IG held an all employee web cast to reinforce these safeguards.  
*       All OIG employees must also re-certify that they have read and understand Departmental and OIG guidance on computer security.

*       Additional training for employees on Privacy Act requirements and computer security is being required for all OIG employees.  

*       Specific policies on PII are being established consistent with new DOT policies being issued in response to OMB's July 12, 2006 memorandum (M-06-19) directing Chief Information Officers to strengthen controls over PII data.

Dear Governor Jeb,

On July 18th,2005 an application for full pardon for my husband was mailed 
to the clemency board. On June 30, 2005 I emailed you asking if you could 
give my husband (who is now 68 years old) and was charged for possession of 
controlled substance(marijuana) in 1985. He received 2 year probation which 
was fulfilled and since we then he is a born again christian and trying to 
live right.

You forwarded my email to Janice Keels, doordinator of office of clemency. I 
have contacted her about this and was told it takes a year to complete. Is 
there anything you can do to speed the process up since it has been a year. 
I  greatly appreciated the help you have given us so far and wish that the 
pardon would come before you get out of office. PLEASE HELP US.

Thank you very much and God bless you and your family.

Hello,
I have not as of yet tried to contact your office about Big Cat Rescue (www.bigcatrescue.org) and the plight of the animals in our care but I am now.  I hope that perhaps somewhere in Governor Bush's schedule he can make time to visit us, at least our web site.  Big Cat Rescue and the problem it represents is state and nationwide, especially in places like Florida and Texas - please read below for my plea to my friends and family of 3 such sanctuaries that are closing.

I would very much like to hear from any of the Governor's staff in this regard.  Exotic animal breeding and ownership must be banned.

Thank you for your time.

Subject:	Help Stop The Problem - Two Colorado Sanctuaries Closing

Hi,
As you know the cats and other animals at Big Cat Rescue have become a very large and important part of my life.  As we know all too well, not every animal can be saved.  Unfortunately for the animals, there are sanctuaries that do try to say "yes" to every animal that is brought to their doors.  Unfortunately even more is that they cannot always continue to support themselves.  The attachments are about the two of the three sanctuaries that we have heard about that have to close for financial reasons.  These two sanctuaries (www.wildlife-sanctuary.org and www.deafpagan.org/pwar.html) that are closing represent 200 animals that face a very uncertain, probably dim, future.  Euthanasia may be the only answer as most sanctuaries such as Big Cat Rescue are full.

There is another sanctuary in Colorado (www.bigcatsofserenitysprings.org) that faces closing because it's founder, 47 year old Karen Sculac, died suddenly of pneumonia that developed from a strep throat.  Her sanctuary houses 105 big cats.  This brings the total of these three sanctuaries to over 300 animals in limbo.

These developments are heart wrenching and heart breaking and completely avoidable and can be rectified.  Many of these organizations are on very fragile ground.  With over 10,000 privately owned tigers alone owned in the United States the problem must be stopped at the source.

I don't expect you to try and help any of these places with funds.  What I would hope you would do is write your local representatives in both your state houses and at a federal level that the ban of exotic animal ownership must be put into place and soon.  These 300 animals did not ask to be born into captivity to be sold as disposable pets and certainly did not ask for the bleak fate that faces them.  Help us put an end to private ownership, backyard and basement breeders of these magnificent animals.

I would ask that you pass this message along to other animal lovers that you know.  A single voice can make a difference.

Thank you for the animals.
Lisa

Dear Governor Bush,

I read your excellent article "How to Help our Kids" on line at the Washington Post website.

I would like to share with you the draft of an unpublishable meta-analysis we did on the Internet a few years ago.  It is the first time in a century the Maria Montessori's contention about the magical effects of giving children adequate practice in writing alphabet letters BEFORE they are old enough to enter first-grade.

The draft of our controlled study is appended.  I hope you will be able to find the time to glance over it, because it contains the secret of real educational reform.

Here is an reedited copy of the article I submitted to the Harvard Educational Review.  

THE WRITING/READING CONNECTION
Submitted March 15, 2004

Abstract

The possible relationship between practice printing alphabet letters and learning to read in the earliest grades has not been adequately explored.  The present article describes preliminary evidence that this relationship may be important, and that reading difficulties may relate directly to inadequate printing practice in kindergarten and first-grade

Historically, many authorities on the subject of literacy instruction have stressed the importance of adequate practice in printing alphabet letters.  The first century Roman scholar Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (ca A.D. 35-98?) has been quoted as writing, "the art of writing well and quickly is not unimportant for our purpose, though it is generally disregarded by persons of quality.  Writing is of the utmost importance in the study which we have under consideration and by its means alone can true and deeply rooted proficiency be obtained." He also wrote, ",,,a sluggish pen delays our thoughts".
                 The full text of the Quintilianus essy, "The Ideal Education", book one, is  accessible at the website:            http://www.molloy.edu/academic/philosophy/sophia/quintilian/education.htm, The Sophia Project, Sophia Study Editions -- Quintilian, Institutes of Oratory, Translated by H.E. Butler (1920) "The Ideal Education, Book One, Chapter 1/sophia/quintilian/education.htm
             In 1912, Maria Montessori wrote, in effect, that teaching young children to print letters is easy, that it is easy to teach children to read after they have practiced printing alphabet letters, but that it is difficult to teach children to read if they have not practiced writing them. 1 
Marilyn Jager Adams noted that prior to the onset of the twentieth century the "spelling drill" was the principal means of inducing literacy for several millennia. 2 
More recently, several published authors have called attention to the dearth of research on the possible link between printing practice and the acquisition of literacy in young children, but objective studies of the relationship are still lacking.3, 4
This author has made the assumption that emphasis on practicing printing alphabet letters increases the fluency with which children can print them.   It was therefore decided to examine the relationship between fluency at printing the alphabet in preliterate children, and their subsequent success in learning to read well.
This method suffers the disadvantage of requiring children to be able to recite the alphabet in order to print the different letters both legibly and at a rate sufficient to demonstrate that they have practiced enough to have become "printing fluent."  However, it was considered superior to other methods of assessing fluency in printing alphabet letters in young children.
Such children have limited attention spans.   It was therefore decided to measure the number of alphabet letters children write during a timed twenty-second interval, and multiply that number by three in order to obtain a "letters-per-minute," or "LPM," value for each child.
During the early months of 2002, five first-grade teachers were enlisted from teacher-related internet listservs, to do a cooperative study of the relationship between fluency in writing the alphabet, and concomitant reading skill.
The printing rate of each child was listed by teachers submitting classroom data, and each was matched by the subjective teacher assessment of the child's relative reading skill.  The assessments were A, B, C, D and E, to designate "excellent", "above average", "average", "below average" and "possible reading problem", respectively.
A total of 94 children in five first-grade classrooms were studied.  When the letter grades were converted to numbers (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), "average relative reading ability" could be determined for subgroups of students, defined as printing at different rates.
Among the sixteen children who printed faster than 40 LPM, the average reading score was 3.6.  Among the 33 children who printed from 30 to 39 LPM, the average was 2.9.  For the 26 children writing at 20-29 LPM, it was 2.3.  For the 21 children who wrote more slowly than 20 LPM, it was 1.6.
During this current school year, a number of kindergarten teachers have submitted series of similar studies on their classrooms to the k1writing listserv, accessible at www.yahoogroups.com.  By the end of February, 2004, a total of five teachers had submitted serial data on a total of 106 kindergarten students, including data for the month of February.
The relative reading skills of the kindergartners were ranked according to a three-level system:  "reading better than grade level", "doing well at grade level" and "lagging behind expectations".  In the opinions of their teachers, six children were already reading at second-grade level or above.
Statistical analysis of the correlation again yielded similar results.  Among the eighteen children who printed the alphabet faster than 40 LPM, 72% were "above grade level," and only one was "lagging."  Among the eighteen children who wrote more slowly than 20 LPM, none was above grade level in reading skill, and half of them were "lagging" in this regard.
A tabulation of these findings is revealing.  It is informative to look down the column of LPM figures for these 106 children, and observe the correlations.  These data are presented in Table One.
The correlation between reading skill and fluency at printing alphabet letters in kindergarten and first-grade is readily apparent.  This correlation was known to each of the experienced [kindergarten] teachers participating in this study even before the study was done.  The experiment, then, was designed to answer the question as to whether this correlation is one of causation, or merely coincident with some other unidentified factor.
The kindergarten teachers involved have each been able to achieve a level of printing fluency that is considerably above what is generally achieved by American kindergarten students.  The printing rates of their kindergarten children are comparable to the rates of the first-grade students in the original study, whose teachers had NOT been previously monitoring printing rate.  If the cause of the correlation were in the opposite direction, and it is having learned to read which drives printing fluency, then one would expect the correlation to weaken in classrooms where printing fluency has been intentionally contrived.  However, we here see the correlation has persisted intact.
This year, each of the kindergarten teachers has been making a dedicated effort to induce objectively measurable printing fluency in the students as the school year progresses.  Each of the five kindergarten teachers has emphatically proclaimed that this practice is found to be immensely helpful in turning young children into readers.
A number of the classrooms have high percentages of poverty and minority children, and none of the children could read at the beginning of the kindergarten school year.  It was found that printing fluency, which we arbitrarily defined as 40 LPM or faster, is achieved at different times by different children, and that such fluency is an excellent indicator of when children will learn to read, as well as indicating which children have become successful at reading at any particular point in time.
It was also observed that printing fluency gradually improves in almost all cases with continued practice writing the alphabet letters.  Failure to cooperate during the time allocated by teachers for dedicated printing practice seems to be the main limiting factor in the development of printing skill.
None-the-less, our data suggest that fluency in writing the letters of the alphabet is a reasonable goal for all normal children by the end of first-grade.
But it appears that printing fluency does not at all correlate with reading ability much beyond the first-grade level.  One teacher submitted data on 54 fourth-graders, demonstrating no difference at all in the median alphabet-printing rates between children who had been formally identified as reading below grade level, and the other students.5
It is also apparent that printing skill is by no means a necessary prerequisite for literacy.  Many children learn to read before they are fluent at printing alphabet letters.  On the other hand, virtually all children who lag in reading skill in K-1 are dysfluent printers.  That this lack of skill is remediable through continued dedicated practice, extended over time, appears to be of fundamental importance.
If the attainment of fluent ability to print alphabet letters in the earliest grades generally assures early success in reading, this fact challenges some current theoretical conceptions regarding the nature of reading disabilities.  
     Our evidence suggests both that printing fluency confers the ability to name random letters more rapidly than 40 per minute6, and that the ability to phonetically write words fluently, possible only after the attainment of fluency in printing letters, confers phonemic awareness.
Adams wrote, "It has been shown that the act of writing newly learned words results in a significant strengthening of their perceptual integrity in recognition.  This is surely a factor underlying the documented advantages of programs that emphasize writing and spelling activities."7
Montessori also considered practice writing alphabet letters to be crucial, and wrote, "We shall soon see that the child, on hearing the word, or on thinking of a word he already knows, will see, in his mind's eye, all the letters, necessary to compose the word, arrange themselves.  He will reproduce this vision with a facility most surprising to us."8
While such rhetorical explanations of the value of writing practice have been seen as nebulous in the past, converging advances in the fields of pattern recognition by artificial intelligence and of the cerebral physiology involved in visual pattern recognition and categorization may render them more plausible.
It is emphasized that these studies are limited and preliminary, but their results underscore the pressing need to either confirm or disaffirm their apparent implications.

Dear Mr. Bush: 

I was in contract with one of your associates recently, Laurie in your office, who suggested I write directly to you for your advise. 

I am in the process of negotiations to purchase the Tallahassee Commercial Airport located on Highway 27 and the Old Bainbridge Road.  This is a dream we can make a reality with your input and help.  

The airport is viable and essential to Tallahassee as a spill-over and as an airport to help with the private segment of Tallahassee.  We want to make a lovely fly-in community complete with viable tax potential.  At present I am in need of help with the financial aspect of this endeavor.  Please, will you help?  I am looking for a minority loan or other funding which might be relative to airports in general either local, state or federal.  It would be most helpful if you could direct me to the appropriate contact person regarding this endeavor.  I and my family are looking forward to becoming a viable asset to Tallahassee and want to continue to help its development with a efficient, effective and viable private airport to enhance the community, our capital and this great state of Florida.  

Thank you in advance for your time and continued help.

SILENCE THE VIOLENCE

 

The Melissa Institute for Violence Prevention and Treatment requests your participation in an invitation-only symposium to address issues related to violence in our community.

 

Since April 5, 2006, the local media has clearly documented an outbreak of violence that has included more than a dozen homicides of children under the age of 17. When the statistics for Broward and Palm Beach County are added, it reflects the concern that exists in south Florida about the problem of violence in the community and how it might be addressed.

 

The symposium presenters and participants will examine the causes of violence. They will describe existing programs currently being offered in the community, and they will attempt to identify some "best practices" for reducing violence. The participants will then develop an advocacy agenda that is a listing of actions that can and should be taken to reduce violence in Miami.  That list will subsequently be shared with such agencies as local government, the school district, The Children’s Trust, health care providers, the judicial system and law enforcement agencies.

 

As a key stakeholder in the community we value your participation in this event.  Please note that there is no cost associated with this event.  Lunch will be provided courtesy of our local sponsors.  The keynote speaker will be Leonard Pitts, who will participate courtesy of the Miami Herald.

Subject:	Pardon

Governor sir, 
 
    I am a 36 year old man that has had some problems with alcohol.  I had two DUI's before I was 18.  I had an accident on my 25th birthday where I hurt myself only and then went into the supervision program to get my license back 7 years later.  I cleaned up my act and I moved from  Panama City Beach while in the program to find a better life in Orlando, Florida.  I adhered to all policies for almost 3 years until one day after all of the money, time off work, and meetings I had done seemed to be for naught when I was told to go to yet another meeting every week because of the truthful answers I gave to my supervisors.  Things I said that about my life and jobs that were known for the whole 3 years and now I was subject to another group session once a week 20 miles through hectic Orlando traffic, which was scary in itself.  
    I was told to go to three AA meetings a week, once-a-month meeting at the Florida Safety Council and now while my life was balanced and moving along positively I was told to go to yet another meeting every Friday morning at a relapse treatment in Longwood.  It had the opposite effect.  They teach in AA that hunger and anger are two most dangerous feelings for relapse.  I feel the Florida Safety Council banked on this fact and tested me with the worse feeling I could get.  The feeling of the rug being yanked out from under me.  While I understand the need for governing the ungovernable I felt that I was set up for failure.  I did everything I was supposed to do and yes I felt the last straw, I was caught at a time where I had a wisdom tooth and no sleep and a past of alcohol abuse.  I had no fight left in me. I was told to show up at yet another meeting that would cost me 100 dollars a month in addition to the 55 to the supervision program and I had not given any reason for this, except I was nearing my termination of the program and I believe it was in their best interest to make one more hurdle for me to jump and yet fail.  
    I led a quiet life and I am an upbeat person all of the time. I try not to let anything get me down.  Of course I felt cheated and forced into a worsened state by the Florida Safety Council because of the time I needed off of work for all of the programs requirements and the money it costs. It is true I was arrested for DUI again, but had it not been for the excess of power over people that have none I do not believe this would have happened.  I have a nice life, a great relationship, and a great job with Disney.  I now have to look to other ways to work where there is no bus stop and while I hope not to end up on the streets, I feel that without a Drivers License that is where I will be, or in the Florida jails.   I was hoping not to have to abandon my home state, but maybe I should or have to.  My father worked for the City of Tallahassee where I was born, my uncle worked for the police of the Capitol of Florida, all of my family works in Tallahassee and I can not go see them unless I get a bus ticket.  This is my last effort to have a life in Florida to ask for a pardon to get my drivers license back.  While I am pretty sure you will not read this or get the gravity of the situation, it is my last effort to stay in Florida, my home, my families home, where I like to call home. 
 
Thank you for listening,

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
 I know you will be visiting Olsmar, Florida this afternoon.  I would like to meet with you again.  I have spoken to Jim McDonough for many years concerning my daughter, Jennifer Reynolds.  Jim knows me and the situation.  
Jennifer has a drug addiction similar to Noelle's situation once was.  I am still trying to save my daughter's life after all these years.  After filing three Marchman Acts in three different counties here in Florida, I have no alternatives left.  My hope and prayer is that Jennifer get into drug treatment before she dies.  It is apparent this will not happen voluntarily on her part.  She would have to be court ordered into treatment.  She already is in the court system in Pinellas County with Honorable Judge Ulmer.  She has lost custody of her son, our grandson until she completes a licenced residential drug treatment program. I have custody of our grandson. Jennifer is not in any drug treatment at this time.  
Jennifer needs help.  Any help would be able to give her would be sincerely appreciated.  Our church (Clearwater First Christian Church) Elders layed hands on Jennifer and prayed for her recovery 2 weeks ago.  There is wonder working power in Jesus.  He uses all of us to get his work done.  If the Lord bends your heart to hear my request and respond, it will be in obedience to the Lord.
I am trying to get Jennifer into Teen Challenge.  They have a women's program in Ft.Myers and one in Ft.Lauderdale.  
If you give Jim McDonough a call, he will tell you who I am and who Jennifer is.
 
Thank you for your time.

Dear Governor Bush, We desperately need your help in finding funding to construct a protype  of our "OcGen" moduel. I started Ocean Renewable Power Company (ORPC) two years ago in the interest of finding alternative energy sources for the State of Florida and reducing Global Warming. Our system is base loaded and uses only the power of the water current to generate electricity with NO Global Warming. We have Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses for six sites in Florida, that would harness the power of the Gulf Steam Current. To date all Research and Development has been funded by myself and other private sources. 

 Being a native from Miami and the company headquartered in Miami, I am acutely aware of our energy needs and we are ready to help. However we have reached a point in our development where we need help from State funding in the amount of five million dollars in order to construct the protype. Working with Florida Atlantic University as well as our own technology team, we are well positioned to make this a commercial reality. The list of companies and agencies we have been working with includes The US Navy through Navsea Carderock  Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center as well as the Navsea South Florida Testing Facility in Dania Beach, Florida. 

As you were the one behind the "Florida Energy Bill to Diversity Fuel Supply with Renewables" in addition to Senator Lee Constantine, which as we read it also contains provisions for our technology, I turn to you for support and guidance, as the process of obtaining Grants or Funding, we have no real experience with. 

I would respectively request a meeting with you in order adequately brief you on the scope of ORPC. It is important we bring this project to fruition at the earliest possible time. If you have the time, I think if you visit our web site found below, it will provide you with further creditworthy information. Once again I ask you for an early meeting and response.

Respectively,

I took pictures of you all and Cannon (his granddaughter) work in your office for a week in Tallahassee. I thought you might want to send your condolences to his wife Mrs. Lyma Raulerson at 5ll E. Macclenny Ave. Macclenny, Fla. The visitation is tonight from 6-9 at the First Baptist Church of Glen St. Mary,  & the Funeral will be there tomorrow at ll;00 at the same church. Thank you and have a Bless day. Gedone Prachar Pres. of the Republican Women of Baker County. l-904-259-l990

Dear Govenor Bush:
 
I have been wanting to send this off to you for quite sometime, and now find that time is running short.  I just wanted to express my personal feelings toward you and your administration....I remember when I was 20 years old, and if our firstborn child was a girl, I was going to name her Regan after my hero, President Ronald Reagan.  The reason for this was that as a woman and mother I felt safe, at least as safe as one could feel in the 70's with the cold war.  President Regan was at the helm of our government, and the USA was in safe hands.  I knew no one would pull one off on Ronnie, at least if he knew about it.  He would keep his eye keen and would go toe-to-toe with opposition against right.
 
With you as Governor of Florida I have felt many similar feelings of stability knowing you were on watch for the State of Flolrida.  You calm, quiet leadership has brought our state back to its feet during hurricanes, I always felt you would do the "necessary" thing.  I greatly appreciated your visibility during crisis - always moving forward in a plan of defense or recovery.   In government, I always felt you would do the "right" thing.  I watched many difficult issues cross your desk and your gentle-giant presence was there to be firm and take action on issues of conscience.  As I watched you raise up against opposition in making our public schools better, I knew you would do the "smart" thing and raise the bar.  The number of students receiving high school degrees has increased and quality education has leaped.  You have challenged our teachers to meet the challenges of our day.  As many heart-wrenching events of children exploitation and murder have come to your attention you have done the "sympathetic" thing for the families and stengthened the hand of justice in determent and prosecution.  As a 49 year old gradmother, all the above mean more to me know than when I was a new mother of one.  Our President is right, there is much evil in this world.  We must not run from it, but we must do what is in our power to thwart it.  
 
Dear Governor Bush, I will miss your leadership for our state.  I thank you, your wife, and your children for the GREAT sacrifice in serving the people.  I know that I do not comprehend what public service really means, I only benefit from others unselfishness.  May God lead you and give your clarity of thought and direction during your transition and future.
 
With great appreciation,
 
Mrs. Laura L. Benigni

Re: Clemency
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing today as his cousin to ask for clemency for James Steven Keller, DC # 114579.  He currently is incarcerated at Sumter Correctional Institute in Bushnell.  He is currently serving 20 years for vehicular homicide.  
 
I am the eldest and James is the youngest of 16 cousins.  He was born when I was 18.  This gives James and me a special bond.  I used to take care of him when he was a baby.  We all grew up in Bradenton.  There were always big family gatherings.  James was very close to our grandmother.  She died when he was very young.  The unfortunate thing is that when she died the big family gatherings went by the wayside and James was not able to cope well. 
 
I have been visiting James in the county jail before the trial and later in prison.  We have discussed the accident and all the ramifications.  James did not start out on 12/21/2000 to commit a violent act.  He made wrong choices in judgment that night that led to MR. Chris Kleuh being killed.  I have seen true changes in James since the accident.  He now understands he can never have alcohol or drugs again.  
 
I would appreciate your reviewing his case for consideration of clemency.  He has an exemplary deportment and work record since he has been in prison.  He currently works in the print shop, tool-room supervisory position.  
 
I thank you Governor Bush for your time and attention to this matter.
 
Sincerely:
Maureen Donohue

Kim Robedeau, Director of New Media Florida Today

Kim, Please see the following note I'm sending to Gov Bush.  I believe a 
great injustice has been done to me and I'm trying to find a media venue to 
get my story out and educate other people in the Brevard County Area on the 
do's and don't of divorce, lawyers, social workers and family support study 
workers.

I make complaints to the Florida Bar - they don't contact me, they don't 
write me back; Gov Bush's office, has early selective memory loss when it 
comes to getting involved with legal matters.  The Whitehouse want write me 
back either.  I can't get anyone to hear me - I need some help.  Please send 
me a note and let me know if your the right person I should be contacting.

Sincerely, Carl Durham


Gov Bush,

Would request you forward the powerful attachment above to Mr. Kerry 
Evander, one of you fine judges down in Brevard County.  Make it required 
viewing and reading for him and all his EVIL Buddy's that hate and have 
discontent for our military, our veterans and disabled veterans.

I know you remember this guy, you know, the one who robed me of my military 
and VA disability.  The one who Sen Nelson's Office in Orlando states is in 
direct violation of federal statue.

Also, would request you give Mr. Evander some travel dollars, so he can 
leave his palace and go see some of the oversee locations where our soldiers 
and marines live and serve.  Just give him a ticket - let you TAG arrange 
his food and living quarters.  I doubt if old Kerry could hang a week - he'd 
be crying for mommy, or for some woman.  I sure you've heard he's good to 
all the women.  I know he was real good to my ex-spouse; some people have 
read the decision and thought, they were probably really close.  I don't 
know and don't care - I just want the money I've been robed of returned and 
evil judges removed who do have the reasonable discernment to deal with all 
people even-handedly.

Subject:	Hurricane Panels    Fire Danger

 
Dear Gov. Bush,
 
I have recently put hurricane panels on all openings of my home.  It gives me great concern that if during the short duration of having these panels on my home, in the event of a fire there is only one way out of the building.  This concern has forced me to devise a storm panel track that can be removed in seconds from the inside of the house, making the entire panel assembly to fall free from the outside wall and allowing the window to become a fire exit.
 
We are currently making a proto-type of this "Fire Trax" assembly, but as you can imagine the expence is quite high.  I feel that there are hundreds of thousands of Florida residents who currently have storm panels installed on their homes and many more who will be installing them in the near future.  I feel it is important to make this assembly available as soon as possible.
 
My question is to your knowledge is there any kind of grant money available for this type of program.  With a small amount of grant money I feel quite comfortable that this could be made available to the residents of Florida (and many other states) within several months.  Without any kind of help it could take us several years as at this time we are having to use very limited funds on this project.
 
Respectfully

Here is a summary of the findings of the state1s operational audit of Cape
Coral's water, sewer and stormwater services between Oct. 1, 2000 and March
31, 2005:

§ Finding No. 1: The City had not maintained its accounting records on a
current basis, or periodically reviewed them for completeness and accuracy.
§Finding No. 2: Written policies and procedures necessary to assure the
efficient and consistent conduct of accounting and business-related functions were not established in all
cases. 

§Finding No. 3: The City had not provided for an adequate separation of
duties in certain areas of
operation, and had not provided for the proper safeguarding of blank checks.

§Finding No. 4: The City did not consider all available net assets from
prior fiscal years in adopting its
2003-04 or 2004-05 fiscal year budgets for the funds combined and reported
as Water and Sewer and
Stormwater Utility, contrary to Section 166.241(2), Florida Statutes.

§Finding No. 5: The City reported budget overexpenditures totaling
approximately $39 million in 7 of the
27 funds reported as Water and Sewer and Stormwater Utility, contrary to
Section 166.241(2), Florida
Statutes. Furthermore, budget-to-actual comparisons were provided to the
City Council only through
the 3rd quarter of the 2004 fiscal year.

§Finding No. 6: Bank reconciliations were not always performed timely, were
not adequately reviewed,
and contained errors.

§Finding No. 7: The City failed to timely report and remit unclaimed
property to the Florida Department
of Financial Services, contrary to Chapter 717, Florida Statutes.

§Finding No. 8: The City did not prepare a financial analysis, including a
calculation of the economic
gain or loss, prior to issuing refunding debt totaling $53 million.

§Finding No. 9: The City did not timely refund special assessments in
excess of project costs for three
completed utility expansion areas.

§Finding No. 10: The City's methodology for determining contributions in
aid of construction (CIAC)
fees may not appropriately match fees charged to actual costs incurred and,
as a result, may be subject
to challenge by property owners.

§Finding No. 11: The City does not have adequate controls in place to
ensure that CIAC fees are timely
collected. 

§Finding No. 12: City Council approved, via vote of City Council members
rather than enactment of an
ordinance, a change in CIAC fees established by ordinance, contrary to
Section 166.041, Florida Statutes.

Further, City staff's actions regarding CIAC and capital expansion fees
charged regarding the North
Loop CIAC project may have been contrary to the City Council1s intentions.

§Finding No. 13: Capital expansion fees and CIAC fees were not always
expended in accordance with the
City's Code of Ordinances and applicable case law.

§Finding No. 14: The City did not always charge utility users appropriate
fees or timely bill for services
rendered. 

§Finding No. 15: Costs for shared administrative expenses from departments
other than utilities were not
always allocated to the Water and Sewer Fund and Stormwater Fund in a
systematic and rational
manner. In addition, some costs directly charged from other departments
were not supported by
documentation to evidence the basis for the direct charge.

§Finding No. 16: Expenditures totaling $131,859 were not supported by
documentation demonstrating
the public purpose served.

§Finding No. 17: The City did not select its bond counsel through a
competitive selection process.

§Finding No. 18: The City did not have written agreements with several bond
professionals. 

Additionally, City practice and its procurement policies and procedures are
contrary to Section 2-148 of
the City's Code of Ordinances regarding required signatures on contracts.
§Finding No. 19: The City did not properly monitor contracts for services
to ensure contractors
performed in accordance with terms of the contract.

§Finding No. 20: The City did not fully comply with provisions of Section
287.055, Florida Statutes, in
procurement of its contract for its utility expansion program.

Additionally, invoices submitted for
payment by the contractor were not adequately supported. Finally, the
City's consultant hired to audit
selected work authorizations relating to its utility expansion program
included several findings and
made several recommendations.

§Finding No. 21: Although the City has taken some actions to reduce water
loss, unaccounted for water
remains in excess of 10 percent. Additionally, preliminary data from a
water audit obtained by the City
indicated several factors, including excessive service leaks, meter testing
and replacement, and
inconsistencies in meter size, that contributed to the City's unaccounted
for water. 

§Finding No. 22: Some of the City1s staff may have inappropriate access to
information technology
system resources. We also noted another deficiency in controls over the
City1s information systems.

§Finding No. 23: The City has not prepared and executed a lease agreement
for its charter school and
the frequency and timing of billings to the charter school for services
provided by the City were not
addressed in Ordinance 41-04.

§Finding No. 24: The City conducted discussions regarding the calculation
of the charter school lease
payments through a liaison rather than in a publicly noticed meeting.

Dear Governor,

We are writing you over the onslaught of negative publicity for Florida as provided by the St. Pete Times and Tampa Bay television stations.  I know that other stations/newspapers are doing the same thing.

We are registered Republican voters.  We are upset over the way the media, on a daily basis, is pointing out to the world that Florida is not a good place to live.  For instance, today's St. Pete Times headline reads "Sunshine Won't Pay the Bills", referring to the high cost of living in Florida.  The article goes on to describe people leaving the state because they can't afford to live here.  Another article in the paper refers to the high cost for closing costs when buying a home as compares to other states, then there is another article about the high cost of insurance and the anticipated increases.  You add this to the media frenzy about hurricanes and no one wants to buy a home in Florida.  This is a HUGE economic problem!  When we were visiting friends in N.C. in June we saw a program on TV showing Clearwater Beach and hyping up the terrible hurricane season we are going to have.  Don't you have a marketing department that could work to overcome this negative publicity?


We have had our condo on the market to sell since last November.  Three other neighbors have had their units for sale longer than us.  It is not just our building....all of Clearwater Beach and Island Estates are having the same problem.  I am told by realtors that all of Tampa Bay is experiencing the same problem.


Please help us!

Dear Governor Bush:

As a member of the Emerald Coast Association of REALTORS and a resident of Northwest Florida, I am extremely concerned about the Air Force's proposed realignment of the 46th Test Wing and it's potentially devastating impact on our area.  Not only would we be dismantling a world class weapons and armament test capability, but the economic impact of losing over 1500 high tech jobs would have an extremely adverse impact on our local economy.  As a concerned citizen, I urge you to do everything in your power to influence the Air Force and Department of Defense officials to reconsider and ultimately not carry out this proposed realignment.

Please read the following article to learn more about the impact of the realignment on our local economy:

GOVERNOR BUSH,
 
 
      A GREAT MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IS TAKING PLACE, RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE. AS YOU KNOW, I'VE APPLIED AS CHAIR/MEMBER OF THE NEWLY FORMED FLORIDA COMMISSION FOR TRANSPORTATION DISADVANTAGED. HAVING SERVED ALMOST EIGHT YEARS ON THAT BOARD (W/2 TERMS AS VICE CHAIR). I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A NATURAL TRANSITION. NOW GOING BACK TO THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION IS BEING REFORMED (BY A BILL FROM SENATOR CONSTANTINE-ORLANDO, AND REPRESENTATIVE ROBAINA). INCIDENTALLY, I WAS TOLD I HAD THE SUPPORT OF BOTH GENTLEMEN (AS WELL AS MANY OTHER LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS) IN MY RE-APPOINTMENT. THEN LAST WEEK, WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU ON THE PHONE, WITH MY OPINION ON HOW SOME INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR MEMBERSHIP (AKA J.R. HARDING), BECAUSE HE WORKS FOR AN ORGANIZATION-DEPT. OF VOC. REHAB/EDUCATION, WHICH PURCHASES TRANSPORTATION. AT THAT TIME YOU INSTRUCTED ME TO SPEAK WITH APPOINTMENT HEAD CELESTE LEWIS, AFTER TRYING TO REACH HER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I GOT A CALL FROM HER THURSDAY, SHE SAID THAT I HAD BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE I HAD BELONGED TO A TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE LESS THAN 5-YEARS AGO, I WAS ON METRO PLAN-ORLANDO'S LOCAL COORDINATING BOARD (LCB), WHICH I LEFT 2 1/2 YEARS AGO. NOW WHEN THE BILL WAS BEING WRITTEN I SPECIFICALLY ASKED SENATOR CONSTANTINE ABOUT THIS LCB MEMBERSHIP DEAL, HE BASICALLY TOLD ME IT WOULD NOT PERTAIN TO ME BECAUSE I WAS A DISABLED PERSON W/NO FINANCIAL INTEREST IN TRANSPORTATION. THEN FRIDAY MS. LEWIS WROTE ME AN EMAIL SAYING I COULD NOT BE ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE OF THE LCB-MEMBERSHIP THING. IN ALL MY 30-YEARS IN COMMUNITY SERVICE/DISABILITY AWARENESS, AND 25 YEARS INVOLVEMENT IN JOURNALISM I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A DOUBLE STANDARD. I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION IS WHY AM I DISQUALIFIED FROM MEMBERSHIP, AND MR. HARDING IS NOT, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, AND THANKS YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. 
 
SINCERELY,

I am a concerned citizen on why David Gore has not been executed. This monster murdered my step niece. He destroyed so many lives and was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt twice. He has had so very many chances to prove his innocence even though he was caught red handed. Lets finally let the survivors and families have a chance at some peace in their lives. I met many people during the most trying times of their lives and they have touched my heart with their courage and strength. Give them peace that they deserve, let us rid ourselves of this monster. I have an eighteen year old daughter that was named after the fifteen year old child that David Gore murdered. Let us stop this and get on with justice, PLEASE. If you have any compassion at least look into the matter, find out why this monster has such power that he is still alive after so many years. You are a Father and an Uncle, look into your heart and do what is right. Thank you, Sincerely, Beverly Huber

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

            I am writing in regards to David Allen Gore who is currently on death row.  Mr. Gore was convicted of several murders 25 years ago in Vero Beach, Indian River County, Florida.  He has gone through several Appeals and has lost those appeals.  How much longer will it take before he gets what he deserves and what he was sentenced to?  THE DEATH PENALTY!  Not life in prison which is what he has been doing for the last 25 years by the expense of the Florida citizens.  His victims, didn’t get to live their lives, he ended those after hours and hours of torture.  His youngest victim, Lyn Elliott was a teenager.  He tortured these women, dismembered their bodies or buried them in drums in the middle of a citrus grove.  Miss Elliott, the young teen actually was tied up in his attic and got free.  Only to be caught running for freedom down his driveway and was shot in the back.   Mr. Gore was a reserve Law Enforcement officer for the Indian River County Sheriffs Department.  He used this capacity to lure women.  In other situations, he just kidnapped, raped, tortured and then killed them.  Dumping their bodies where ever he felt.  Why are the citizens of the State of Florida, including you, still paying for this evil devil?  I think as Governor its time for you to put your foot down and enforce the sentence imposed on this man.  

            I truly hope as Governor of the State of Florida, who has done an excellent job for several years would consider fulfilling this task prior to the end of your tenure.  

 

Thank you for your time and consideration in this case,

              Director, Transportation Security Administration


 FROM:               Florida Keys Airport Initiative, Inc. 

  RE:                   TSA Denial of Service for Marathon Airport, FL Keys

 

The Florida Keys Airport Initiative, Inc. is a Citizen’s group formed to raise financial and community support for bringing commercial air service back to the Middle Keys. Our organization, working cooperatively with County Government and our Community, actively participated in the successful process to obtain Federal funds to support this endeavor via the Small Community Air Service Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. In concert with this effort, we were able to raise more than $300,000 in donations and pledges from individuals and companies that recognized the tremendous economic impact of returning airline service to the community.  (The study conducted identified the potential for $43 Million  in revenue to the Middle Keys). Subsequently, we were able to secure commitments from two airlines willing to work with us to make this dream a reality.

 

It is our understanding that County staff has been dealing with TSA for many months now, receiving advice and instructions on facility requirements necessary to prepare for TSA’s provision of service at our facility. To our knowledge there has never been a mention that this would be an issue. Therefore, we are puzzled as to this late hour decision and further perplexed as to how and why one arm of the Federal Government would soundly support this project by way of the commitment of tax dollars while another, the TSA, would seemingly thwart the effort via this denial of service.  

 

We are urgently appealing to you to please do all that is in your power to reconsider and reverse this decision as soon as possible. Our window of opportunity is rapidly closing as the airlines have placed us on notice of their intent to withdraw unless this issue is promptly resolved. If further information is needed, please contact our Director of Airports, Mr. Peter Horton at (305) 292-3518 or on his cell phone (305) 304-0063.  His email address is: horton-peter@monroecounty-fl.gov.

 

In closing, in the letter from the TSA, a non-specific “lack of resources” was cited as the reason for this denial of service. We are pleading for the TSA to reverse this decision however, in the unfortunate event TSA chooses not to do so, we respectfully request a written explanation explicitly identifying the actual issues and any steps, as taxpayers, we may take to address them.  Though we are focused on our own dilemma at this time, the answer to this question has broad reaching implications for our and for many other communities who are seeking or have obtained Small Community Air Service Grants from the Federal Government. 

 

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing you today on a matter of extreme urgency. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has notified Monroe County that they are not going to support the County’s effort to bring air service to the Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH).

For more than a year, the citizens of Monroe County have been working extremely hard to return air service to the Middle Keys. A feasibility study was conducted. Monroe County applied for and received a $750,000 Small Community Air Service Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The local community raised more than $300,000 in matching funds for the grant. The City of Marathon has donated $200,000 of in kind services by supplying the Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) function. The Tourist Development Council has pledged $600,000 over the course of three years to provide advertising of the new air service. And the Florida Department of Transportation will supplement airport security with a grant for $550,000. Our region was very severely impacted by four hurricanes last year. The last and most catastrophic was Wilma in October of 2005 that flooded the middle and lower keys with six feet of storm surge. Our economic impact study completed last year, states that air service into the Florida Keys Marathon Airport will provide $43.7 million in annual revenue to the Florida Keys. These funds are now desperately needed to hasten our recovery and provide sustained economic stability.

Please do all that is in your power to intervene on our behalf to convince the TSA to reverse their disastrous decision. If further information is needed, please contact our Director of Airports, Mr. Peter Horton at (305) 292-3518 or on his cell phone (305) 304-0063.

Hello,

My name is Stann Galloway,  I am a life long Washington County Florida resident, tax Payer, and registered voter.  Recently my employer of 18+ years decided to move it's operations from Marianna. Florida to Ripon WI.  It goes without saying,  I had much rather remain in my home state.  My concern as well as others I'm sure, is the very long commute some us have to make outside of our home counties in order to obtain gainful employment. I try to spend as much of my money in my home county as possible but let's face it, you tend to spend money in the area you work.  This has to hurt the county's economy.   I fully understand that Washington county is a rural county and that the top jobs are in larger areas.  It appears to me and several others that our county leaders should and could do more to lure more jobs to our area.  the major problem is that, our county leaders are many times business owners themselves.  Making them afraid to bring business into the area.

I currently commute over 50 miles one way and 3 counties away just to earn a modest living.  I am too aware that mine is not an isolated case.  My request to you and our government officials is to please do everything possible to lure employers to these small counties.  There must be something we can do.  I am more than willing to do my part.

I have attached my resume in hopes that you are who ever reads your e-mails may know of a position in Washington County that may help.

Thank you very much for your time,

After several years of not having major commercial airline service into our airport, the community and Federal agencies have been collaborating to get service started, including mandated improvements to the airport to meet Homeland Security's - and the TSA's - requirements. $300,000 in local pledges were secured to guarantee the airlines' financial viability, which was to be matched by Federal grants. About $3 million+ in additional money was obtained for the project. Delta/Continental and Gulfstream Airlines agreed to initiate the routes, and were to begin service in the fall. The service to our city would complement the only other viable airport in the Keys (Monroe County), that in Key West, which is under reconstruction but has effectively reached capacity. It is estimated that enhanced commercial service to our airport would equate to tens of millions of dollars in revenue to our county. 
 
Then, a few days ago, after having consulted with the county and city for some time - and being well aware of the airport project - the TSA stated that baggage checkers could not be provided. The airlines immediately moved to cancel their contracts.
 
The TSA's contention that airlines could direct travelers to "unsecure" sections of Atlanta's - and other - airports, is, according to the airlines, not feasible. (Understandable, since travelers trying to make connections would not be inclined to go and get their bags, exit the "unsecure" area, and go through security again to check their bags.)
 
We can only conclude that there has been a "disconnect," where one branch (or in this case, department) of a government agency does not know what another has been trying to accomplish. If it is in your power to effect a reversal of this decision, middle Florida Keys residents will be eternally grateful.
 
Thank you for listening.
 
Sincerely,
 
Richard and Anita Nelson

Can you tell me why my daughter, who is recognized as handicapped by the state must pay more for a first floor apartment in a HUD -regulated complex? She has applied for an apartment at Nantucket Cove, in Hernando county and was accepted, but they told her she would have to take a second-floor apartment unless she could prove $400 more income per month somehow. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I am hoping she can get into a first floor  place, as going up and down 15 stairs would be a great hardship for her. Of course there is no elevator.
 
Thank you for your attention to this most urgent matter. No one with physical handicaps should be put in this position. I am a registered nurse and realize full well how difficult being on the second floor would make her life.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
This email is to express my support for nominee Tara Paluck for Lee County Judge.
 
I have known Ms Paluck since she began practicing law here in 1994.  We have had many cases in which she represented one party and I represented either the adversary or a co-defendant.  I have also had the opportunity to observe her interact with her clients when I have mediated cases in which she has been involved.
 
Her knowledge of the law and case preparation has always been excellent.  She also displays a nice balance between advocacy and respect for her opposition.
 
I think Tara's mix of a solid work ethic and respect for the legal system would make her an excellent appointment to the bench.  
 
Please give Tara Paluck serious consideration for County Court.  Lee County would be well served to have Tara on the bench.

I am writing you today on a matter of extreme urgency.   The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has notified Monroe County that they are not going to support the Countyâ€™s effort to bring air service to the Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH).
 
For more than a year, the citizens of Monroe County have been working extremely hard to return air service to the Middle Keys. A feasibility study was conducted. Monroe County applied for and received a $750,000 Small Community Air Service Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The local community raised more than $300,000 in matching funds for the grant. The City of Marathon has donated $200,000 of in kind services by supplying the Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) function. The Tourist Development Council has pledged $600,000 over the course of three years to provide advertising of the new air service. And the Florida Department of Transportation will supplement airport security with a grant for $550,000.  Our region was very severely impacted by four hurricanes last year. The last and most catastrophic was Wilma in October of 2005 that flooded the middle and lower keys with six feet of storm surge. Our economic impact study completed last year, states that air service into the Florida Keys Marathon Airport will provide $43.7 million in annual revenue to the Florida Keys. These funds are now desperately needed to hasten our recovery and provide sustained economic stability. 
 
Please do all that is in your power to intervene on our behalf to convince the TSA to reverse their disastrous decision.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

On September 10, 2006 Boca Raton Community Church will be conducting a “Celebration of Dedication” service to dedicate a significant renovation and expansion of the church’s facilities here in downtown Boca Raton.  We would like to invite you to attend and be a part of this significant moment in our Church’s life.  

 

If your schedule doesn’t allow, we would certainly understand and would ask that you consider sending a congratulatory letter that we would read as part of our ceremony.   We have taken the liberty of drafting the enclosed letter for your consideration.  Should you wish to send a similar but differently worded letter, please feel free.  The attached draft is provided to try and save your staff from crafting such a letter from scratch!  

 

The 50 year old Boca Raton Community Church with a membership of nearly 2,000 is not only historically significant but is also a present and growing part of the Boca Raton community.   We have historically been a winter bible conference location, where Billy Graham and many other renowned evangelists have spoken, and large portions of the modern New International Version or “NIV” Bible were translated.  Today we believe we are being called to expand our reach by replicating our church in locations throughout the world.   

 

Again, we would love to have you attend and participate in our dedication service.  If however you cannot, we would hope that you could provide the attached or similar letter on your office stationary before the event so we might be able to include it in our “Program of Dedication”.  We thank you for your consideration, and wish you all the best in the remainder of your term and in all of your future endeavors.  

 

God bless you,

Dear Governor Bush:

I am extremely concerned about the Air Force's proposed realignment of the 46th Test Wing and it's potentially devastating impact on our area.  Not only would we be dismantling a world class weapons and armament test capability, but the economic impact of losing over 1500 high tech jobs would have an extremely adverse impact on our local economy.  As a concerned citizen, I urge you to do everything in your power to influence the Air Force and Department of Defense officials to reconsider and ultimately not carry out this proposed realignment.

Hi, I would like to know why Sheriff Mascara of St. Lucie County is allowed to get away with things that seem shady. One of these is his dealings with Aramark. He allowed this corp. to take over the kitchen (Meals) and canteen of the jail in Sept of 2004. I was incarcerated at the time and a group of us sued him and Aramark around April of 2005. A contract was not signed between them until April of 2005!!!  Allowing them free rein for around 6 months, and they only signed a contract AFTER we sued them. NOW, guess who was a big contributor to his golf tournament, you guessed it, ARAMARK!!!
 
He is also allowing ARAMARK to take out the subsistence fees from inmate’s canteen accounts. According to Florida law, this has to be given back to inmates that are found not guilty as I was. It is also supposed to go through the Clerk of Court according to the documentation I have read. They are NOT doing this and go out of their way to keep from giving this money back. I believe that Sheriff Mascara and ARAMARKS dealings should be investigated fully. I intend to keep sending this to every governmental agency including Congress, Senate, House of Representatives, County Commissioners, ETC until I get an answer as to why this has not been looked into by Someone. I hope you are able to check this atrocity out and if there is in fact wrongdoing, Take action as they did with the head of DOC.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am writing you today on a matter of extreme urgency.   The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has notified Monroe County that they are not going to support the County’s effort to bring air service to the Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH).

 

For more than a year, the citizens of Monroe County have been working extremely hard to return air service to the Middle Keys. A feasibility study was conducted. Monroe County applied for and received a $750,000 Small Community Air Service Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The local community raised more than $300,000 in matching funds for the grant. The City of Marathon has donated $200,000 of in kind services by supplying the Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) function. The Tourist Development Council has pledged $600,000 over the course of three years to provide advertising of the new air service. And the Florida Department of Transportation will supplement airport security with a grant for $550,000.  Our region was very severely impacted by four hurricanes last year. The last and most catastrophic was Wilma in October of 2005 that flooded the middle and lower keys with six feet of storm surge. Our economic impact study completed last year, states that air service into the Florida Keys Marathon Airport will provide $43.7 million in annual revenue to the Florida Keys. These funds are now desperately needed to hasten our recovery and provide sustained economic stability. 

 

Please do all that is in your power to intervene on our behalf to convince the TSA to reverse their disastrous decision. If further information is needed, please contact our Director of Airports, Mr. Peter Horton at (305) 292-3518 or on his cell phone (305) 304-0063.  His email address is: horton-peter@monroecounty-fl.gov.

 

                                                            Respectfully,

Subject:	[*] Special Appointed, Interim Sheriff for Alachua County

Dear Governor Bush,

I first must say thank you to you, your brother and your father, for serving us all so well, during what has proven to be some of America's most trying hours. I can only hope that we as a country can stay the course in the future, find others like you who will stand firm and do the right thing, so as not to loose any of the hard fought progress that the shed blood of Americans helped pay for.

I know you don't know me from Adam, but I have had the great honor voting for you twice, and of actually shaking your hand several years ago at a Police Memorial Service there at the Capital. And I proudly helped provide security for President George Bush while he campaigned in Gainesville, just before his victory during the last presidential election. I feel I know what you stand for, making this request much easier to ask, of such an important man as yourself, so here goes.

As I said before, you don't know me, but I am a career Law Enforcement Officer who was born and raised in North Central Florida. My father proudly served as a Law Enforcement Officer before me, starting from the time of his return from World War Two, and lasting until his retirement in 1978. I myself have now served more than thirty years, with 28 of those having been as a Deputy Sheriff at the Alachua County Sheriff's Office in Gainesville. I will be retiring in June of 2007, and so I know what pride, commitment and a life of public service really means. I am writing you today with a very special request, a request that when an appointment is made for the interim Sheriff for Alachua County, that retired Sheriff's Captain J.M. "Buddy" Crevasse be the one you choose to place in that position. Knowing that this appointment will only be for the brief period between the departure of Sheriff Steve Oelrich, and the election of a new Sheriff in November. My request is even more special than had it been for a longer term of office, as some people would believe that it really matters little who you appoint, I firmly disagree with that sentiment, for the reasons I write below. 

Buddy Crevasse, like myself had a great role model, both of which made tremendous sacrifices over the years, often going in harms way to protect the  citizens of Alachua County. Buddy, is the son of Retired Sheriff J. M. "Joe" Crevasse and was practically raised up at the Sheriff's Office in Gainesville. While being exposed to both the good and the bad elements of society by that experience and having so many heroes around him at such an early age, Buddy followed in his dad's foot steps, to become a Deputy Sheriff himself, progressing to the rank of Captain within the Alachua County Sheriff's Office before his retirement. 

My request is all about pride and honor, not self satisfaction or political gain. Over the years I have worked along side of Buddy, and I have grown to know him as a close friend. In talking to him, I know what a proud day it would be to become Sheriff and fulfill a lifelong dream to follow his dad into that office. I know from talking to him that even more than self-satisfaction, he would give anything to be able to honor his dad, by standing beside him, while being sworn in as a Sheriff. I'm sure the pride your Father, President Bush felt as your brother followed him into that esteemed office was much the same that father and son, if given the opportunity, would experience here as well.

My father had the great pleasure of working for both Sheriff Joe Crevasse  as well as with "Buddy", and he always spoke highly of their integrity and their caring ways, before his death. I was never fortunate enough to work directly for Sheriff Crevasse, but I did work for Buddy for many years, and can only echo what my father had told me of his virtues.  He worked his way up from an impressionable kid that hung around the old jail, to a highly respected professional who always tried to honor his father's legacy by doing the right thing as a Deputy Sheriff.

Governor Bush, I know you to are a very busy man, but I also know you are a just and honorable man who owes a great deal to your dad and one who holds him in very high esteem, just as both Buddy and I do our fathers. So please consider this request as it was intended, a chance to achieve something few others will ever be allowed to do. Buddy has already proven himself as a great Lawman, so why not reward him with this position as the crowning moment in his stellar career? He is more than adequately qualified, and very deserving, so I hope you will agree with me, and that you will grant my request.

 

Thank you sir, for your time and consideration,

 your humble servant,

Deputy Farnell Cole

The Honorable Jeb Bush,

 

I saw today that the City of Jacksonville has filed suit to block the placing on the ballot of the Cecil Field return to flight initiative. I have some thoughts that I’d like to share.

 

The voters of Duval County worked very hard to get enough signatures to place this on the ballot. It seems to me that  this would have a major impact on the surrounding counties as well as the entire state. The State of Florida should step in and see this issue remains on the ballot. The financial gain to the state could be enormous. If Cecil Field were to reopen as a military facility: 1. There would be immediate incentive to make Mayport nuclear capable… the majority of a carrier’s squadrons could be locally based therefore saving more money. 2. NADEP Jacksonville would be an even more attractive site for repairs… closer to the squadrons it serves. For that matter… Cecil would be an even better place to build a modern depot maintenance facility… right where they are based. 3. We can’t forget that the decommissioning of the S-3 squadrons and then the P-3 squadrons at NAS Jacksonville are coming and then what are we left with? If push comes to shove why can’t an offer for the exchange be made for the prime riverfront property of NAS Jacksonville for Cecil Commerce Center? It was a major mistake to let Cecil go in the first place… we can’t afford to make that mistake again. Florida… not just Duval County needs Cecil Field re-opened. The bottom line… Florida needs Cecil and the good things it would bring.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Ms Tara Wainwright, 

We are in receipt of your letter dated August 7, 2006 stating that Governor Bush is unable to attend out annual banquet on September 16th 2006.  We hope that you can accommodate us with an official welcome letter signed by the Governor that can be presented at the banquet.  

In previous years, we have received a signed letter on letterhead from the Governor welcoming our members and guests, commending our organization, encouraging our work, and supporting our efforts and vision. We have always included his letters in the banquet program, which has been welcomed by our community members.  We would appreciate it if a letter of this nature can be sent to our office in time to be included in this year’s banquet.  

Since the governor has not been able to join us in the last four years that we invited him, we would appreciate it if arrangements could be made to send the Tampa liaison to the banquet in his place. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Subject:	TSA/Marathon, FL airport

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has recently refused  
funding the necessary security for opening the Marathon, FL airport  
for commercial travel. This follows years of planning and a grant of  
$1.5 million from the FAA to ready the airport. Don't these two  
government agencies communicate?

We were eagerly planning to use the Marathon airport as a new  
departure point for a trip in November. Just as we were ready to make  
the reservations, we read of the TSA refusal. This small amount of  
money requested from the TSA/ Homeland Security budget is  
insignificant in comparison to the money squandered illegally by FEMA  
in New Orleans.

Flights in and out of Key West are limited and often are not  
available.  Commercial flights at Marathon would alleviate  
reservation difficulties for Keys residents and visitors.

Please reconsider and provide the TSA funding for security measures  
at the Marathon, FL airport.   Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush

My name is Juan M. Ortiz and I live in Pinecrest, Florida 33156.  I am
writing to you to urge you to request for a special session of the
Florida Legislature as soon as possible to address the outrageous
increase in windstorm insurance premium rates.  I was expecting rates
to double given the hurricanes we have experienced in the last two
years.  I was not prepared to get an invoice equal to 4.3 times my
2005/2006 premium with less than 60 days notice.

My recent invoice from HomeWise Insurance, which assumed my policy
from Citizens Property Insurance in January 2006, is charging me
$12,432 for windstorm coverage for the policy year 2006/2007.  My
premium for 2005/2006 under the Citizens policy was approximately
$2,900.   Given the lack of insurers underwriting risk in Florida I
have little choice but to stay with HomeWise.

This is a travesty that I hope you will address through a special
session as soon as possible.  I cannot believe that the Florida
Legislature had this result in mind when it came up with solutions to
the Citizens dilemma.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
 
I am Patricia Ann Drake, the reason I am e-mailing you is in regards to an incident that occurred in Florida while I was attempting to endorse my registered nursing licenses to gain employment in your state.  
 
I am not familiar with the roads of Florida and became lost upon a road.  I exceeded the speed limit to avoid collision with a semi-truck convoy leading to two men pointing pistols at the my head in two directions while I was a complete stop at a red light near Wal_Marts.  These two men used excessive brutal physical force without reasonable cause, claimed I said I was talking on my cellular telephone and had bombs in my vehicle, physically threw me into a patrol car smacking my head off the pastic in the back of the patrol car, wrote false statements and reports to claim I was driving in the wrong direction and etc. which was not true, fingerprinted and booked me without legal representation, did not read me my miranda rights, did a orifice search--rectal upon me, searched my vehicle and apprehended my vehicle without right, claimed my five and half year old medication was cocaine--in my legal prescription medical vial, made excessive bail upon me without fleeing or other reasonable cause --violating my eightth ammendment, held me in jail for a year and three months without regard to the fact and truth that I was innocent, and much more.  
 
I am not sure why I am being directed to ask you and the board to remove this charges from my record since the charges were all dropped without concern to the damage to me personally, my family, my career, my property --given to my sister without my legal consent which she totally damaged, the false imprisonment passed ninety days to produce evidence or release, and much more.  
 
Please send me the proper information and explain to me why this must take place since I was excused from these charges!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing you today on a matter of extreme urgency.   The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has notified Monroe County that they are not going to support the County’s effort to bring air service to the Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH).
 
For more than a year, the citizens of Monroe County have been working extremely hard to return air service to the Middle Keys. A feasibility study was conducted. Monroe County applied for and received a $750,000 Small Community Air Service Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The local community raised more than $300,000 in matching funds for the grant. The City of Marathon has donated $200,000 of in kind services by supplying the Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) function. The Tourist Development Council has pledged $600,000 over the course of three years to provide advertising of the new air service. And the Florida Department of Transportation will supplement airport security with a grant for $550,000.  Our region was very severely impacted by four hurricanes last year. The last and most catastrophic was Wilma in October of 2005 that flooded the middle and lower keys with six feet of storm surge. Our economic impact study completed last year, states that air service into the Florida Keys Marathon Airport will provide $43.7 million in annual revenue to the Florida Keys. These funds are now desperately needed to hasten our recovery and provide sustained economic stability. 
 
Please do all that is in your power to intervene on our behalf to convince the TSA to reverse their disastrous decision. If further information is needed, please contact our Director of Airports, Mr. Peter Horton at (305) 292-3518 or on his cell phone (305) 304-0063.  His email address is: horton-peter@monroecounty-fl.gov.

We are writing to the Florida congressional delegation, our other oversight committee chairs and ranking members, and Governor Bush to inform them of a laptop stolen from an employee's GOV car in Miami, FL that contains multiple databases of personally-identifiable information (PII) of certain Florida residents.  We have notified the FBI and are working with the Miami-Dade Police Department in an intensive effort to recover the laptop.  We are still reviewing a backup of the computer's hard drive to determine what other information may be contained on the laptop. We will be notifying the affected individuals, maintaining a 24/7 hour hotline, and offering a reward for information leading to the recovery of the laptop. 

In order to inform everyone at the same time, we are establishing a conference call briefing with Todd Zinser, Acting IG, at 2:30 p.m. TODAY, August 9th.  In order to access the briefing, please call 888-566-5791 shortly before that time.  The passcode is 5873283 (followed by the # sign).

Dear Sirs,

I am a reporter of the Polish daily (one of the leading ones). We would 
like to run a whole page interview with Governor Jeb Bush. Therefore, I 
would appreciate if he answered my questions by e-mail or we can do it 
on the phone, if he wanted.

The questions are as follows:

1. What is your biggest success and biggest failure as a governor?

2. What do you like and hate most about being the governor?

3. What are your future plans in politics. Are you going to be the 
President?

4. Who is a better President - your father or your brother?

5. Do you have contact with Polish polititians or other Poles? Who exactly?

6. Have you ever been to Poland? What do you like or dislike about 
Poland (for example food)?

7. Do you plan to visit Poland? When? On what purpose?

8. The Pole in the street is not interested in what regulations govern 
for the United States to maintain visas for Poles. This issue tarnishes 
the image of America as an ally and a friend of Poland. Especially as 
the United States made an exception and once waived visas for Ireland 
although this country, like Poland, did not meet visa waiver program 
criteria. Why the United States dont want to make an exception for 
Poland and waive visas for Poles?

Dear Governor Bush:

My name is Constance White-Davis, and I am the Principal of Alta Vista Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida.  

In 1999, our school received a school grade of "D."  For the past three years, we have maintained our school grade of "A," and this past year for the first time, Alta Vista Elementary has met the federal guidelines of No Child Left Behind and achieved Adequate Yearly Progress.  I also wish to inform you that we are a Reading First School and have made remarkable progress.  For the second year in a row, Alta Vista has made the most reading gains (77%) with our lowest 25th percentile.

I had the opportunity to hear you speak at the Just Read Florida Conference this past July in Orlando.  My Reading Coach and I were also presenters at the conference whereby we had the opportunity to share our story of the challenges and success of moving from a "D" to an "A" and making "AYP."  By participant request, an additional session was added for our presentation.

You mentioned that you visited schools during the school year.  I would like to extend an invitation for you to visit Alta Vista and perhaps present the Florida School Recognition Award in acknowledgment of Alta Vista's performance.   I know that your visit would be an extreme honor to the students, parents, and staff of Alta Vista Elementary.

I thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Most of our soldiers ( I believe all of them) have been deployed to various area's around the world.  This evening gives all of us the opportunity to thank our vets.  These soldiers span from various wars and conflicts.  They include WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Cold War, Panama, Gulf War, Bosnia, Cuba, Afghanistan and Iraq.  What an amazing evening it will be.  We are expecting a quiet evening, but it being full of praise for their continuing effort to serve our country.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
On September 8th, our church, Calvary Tabernacle, 10930 US Highway 301 South, Thonotosassa, Florida, will be celebrating the 25th Pastoral Anniversary of Pastor James and Ann Wolfe.  I would like to request that you honor them with a congratulatory letter for their years of service to the Tampa community and to the members of Calvary Tabernacle.  
 
My family and I have been members of Calvary Tabernacle, where I am the Minister of Music, for the past 7years.  However, we have known Pastor and Mrs. Wolfe for nearly 25 years.  They have always been great examples of faith, love and care.  Both Pastor and Mrs. Wolfe have experienced tremendous health problems (she's fighting her 3rd bout of breast cancer), but in the face of all of their adversities, both continue to be pillars of incredible faith.  Often when it is they who need prayer, they are visiting the sick and praying for others.  Repeatedly, their problems are secondary to those to whom they minister even though their difficulties are often far greater.  They are both true shepherds and Godly leaders, and it would be a blessing to them for you to give a word of encouragement, congratulations, and honor.  In fact, it would be wonderful if you could attend this event and deliver your good wishes personally, but, in the event that you cannot, I'd like to request your written congratulations and well wishes to Pastor and Mrs. Wolfe.
 
Please let me know if you need any additional information.
 
Thank you very much for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

 

I respectfully request to be considered for the now vacant Charlotte County District 5 commission seat.  I have been a resident of Florida for thirty two years and have served my communities as an employee of the Public Works Department in Manatee County for thirteen years and here in Charlotte County for eight years.  I am a stable man not given to moving around on a whim and love the area I live in.  I am residing within the boundaries of Charlotte County Commission District 5.   

 

Being involved in County Government for the past years I have an understanding of the County Government System and how the County Works.  I have been recently applauded for my foresight in recognizing this opportunity and coordination with the Department of Transportation to help the expansion of the County’s fiber optic communications infrastructure at a considerable cost savings to the County.   I have exemplary performance reviews and consider myself to be a valuable member of the team that is Charlotte County Government.  I have the ability to understand complex concepts and communicate them to the audience I have in front of me.  I have experience in public speaking, having been given the task on many occasions to address groups of citizens, co workers and my contemporaries in other government positions.  I have first hand experience at disaster response, managing the contractors and my staff through the difficult times following Hurricane Charley. 

 

While I have dealt with local business men, community leaders, Florida Department of Transportation officials and developers, my ties are to the working people in Charlotte County, and it those citizens I seek to serve.  I am considered to be honest, forthright and not given to extremes.  I am an avid fisherman and consider myself a steward of the environment but not at the expense of common sense.  

 

In short, while I don’t have the political experience of some of the other candidates you may be considering, that alone could be an asset; I am not tied to any organizations or corporations and consider myself to be a person of principle.  Please consider my request,

Mr. Bush;
4th Annual Responsible Dog Ownership Day
My name is Janet Billups and I am with the Inverness Florida Kennel Club. I am the coordinator for the Responsible Dog Ownership Day which is held each year during the month of September. Our event will be held this year on September 23rd.
The Inverness Florida Kennel Club is a American Kennel Club member and the AKC promotes this event. 
This day will be for the citizens of Citrus County to come to a local area with their dogs to learn all about proper care for their dogs and also the Florida statues concerning Dog ownership. We will also have booths for reduced cost rabies vaccinations and also micro-chipping for the dogs. 
The Citrus County Sheriff's Dept. will be doing a demonstration with the K-9 unit and we hope to have a Bloodhound search demonstration by Duke Snodgrass with his 832 Deputy Dawgs. We will also have Hurricane preparedness for owners and their animals.
The Governor of North Carolina sent the AKC a letter of congratulations them. I was wondering if you could possible do the opening ceremonies. 
I know how busy you are and that it will probably be impossible. However, I think it is very important that people know that through out the country, Over 1 BILLION dollars is spent in tax dollars to care for the unwanted and abused dogs that end up in shelters around the country.
I believe that it would be a positive note to at least have a letter from the Governor of Florida showing that The GREAT State of Florida does care about the dogs of our state.

Jeb - I know this email is a little dated, but I think I missed it the first time.  Anyway, why can't the state be first in having corporations who do business here internalize the cost of products discussed.  This will provide them with incentives for becoming a more sustainable business and the taxpayer doesn't have to foot the bill through more bureaucracy. Hasn't Tim Center with the Sustainable Florida group come up with some solutions by now? Take care.

A number of toxic substances are used in of electronics, from the liquid
crystal displays on cell phones to the circuit boards inside computers. The
lead, used in glass panels of computer monitors, in soldering of printed
circuit boards and in cell phones, can leach from landfills and contaminate
drinking water. In addition to negatively affecting brain development in
children, the toxin can cause nervous- and blood-system damage as well as
kidney problems. Lead constitutes more than half of the 70 percent of
consumer electronics contribution of heavy-metal waste in US landfills.

Cadmium, another toxin that damages the kidneys, is used in computer-chip
resistors, semiconductors and cell phones'circuitry, batteries and liquid
crystal displays. Mercury, used in circuit boards, medical equipment and cell
phones, can accumulate in people, animals and plants, leading to brain
damage. And brominated flame retardants (BFRs), used in the plastic casings
of computers, televisions and cell phones, increase risk of cancer.

Chad Raphael, professor at Santa Clara University and chair of the Silicon
Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC), said "We have to stop sweeping our toxic
trash under other people's rugs."

Westervelt said that with municipalities scrambling to keep the
electronic-waste stream out of landfills, local officials are concerned that
if they charge to recycle toxic electronics, consumers will illegally dump
the materials or continue to store them in their homes and businesses.
"I talk with hundreds of recyclers around this country and they all say the
same thing -which is you cannot responsibly process this waste stream without
charging or without having some sort of revenue coming in," said Westervelt,
adding that it costs between $10 to $30 to properly recycle each computer or
TV.

In the absence of federal leadership on e-waste, states are passing their own
laws, which discourages recyclers from creating a national electronic
recycling system.

However, local store outlets of national chains can be required to set up
"drop off" points for the manufacturers of the equipment they sell, to be
returned in bulk to the manufacturer for safe disassembly, recycling, and
disposal.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:

 

I am writing you today on a matter of extreme urgency. Attached is a letter from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) informing us that they are not going to support our effort to bring air service to the Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH).

 

For more than a year, the citizens of Monroe County have been working extremely hard to return air service to the Middle Keys. A feasibility study was conducted. We applied for and received a $750,000 Small Community Air Service Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The local community raised more than $300,000 in matching funds for the grant. The City of Marathon has donated $200,000 of in kind services by supplying the Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) function. The Tourist Development Council has pledged $600,000 over the course of three years to provide advertising of the new air service. And the Florida Department of Transportation will supplement airport security with a grant for $550,000.

 

We have negotiated and signed contracts with Delta Airlines and Gulfstream International (The Continental Connection). However as you can see from the attached letter from Delta, all of our efforts will be wasted unless TSA is there to provide screening of passengers and baggage.

 

Gulfstream has also told us verbally with a letter soon to follow, that operating out of MTH without TSA screening is not feasible. The urgency of this appeal is that air service is set to begin on October 29, 2006. Flights to and from MTH have already been scheduled and booked. Mr. David Hackett, the President of Gulfstream International has told us that unless the TSA’s decision is reversed by August 13th, he will be forced to cancel all bookings for MTH and reassign the aircraft to other locations.

 

Please do all that is in your power to intervene on our behalf to convince the TSA to reverse their disastrous decision. Commercial airline service is vital to our economy here and there is tremendous public outcry to make this happen.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

 

Sincerely,

 

Chris Bull

Mayor, City of Marathon

Good evening Mam,
 
My name is Deb Burnett.  I am a Citrus County, Florida resident.  I have lived in Florida for over three years, but recently moved to Citrus County for career advancement.  I have been a medical transcriptionist for over 11 years, supporting my family.  I have been given the opportunity to purchase a transcription company, but lack the funds to do so.  I am wondering if there are state grants available to such a person in my situation.  I am a white female.  I do have an employee who is white, female and disabled.  I will also be hiring other low income individuals.  
 
The person who owns the company now is wanting to retire, but is "upside down" in some of his assets as well as losing accounts.  I believe that this company has a future in this area.  With the right person at the helm and fresh innovations, and "new blood" I believe this company will flourish and be a tremendous asset to the community.
 
Any help you can give or information you can share, would be GREATLY appreciated.  I thank you for your time and efforts.
 
Sincerely,
 
Deborah L. Burnett

We haven't talked in quite a while, but I thought you might like to know that my daughter, Eleanore -- who graduated from Rice in May -- has just started with Teach for America -- teaching 6th grade english in Little Haiti in Miami (Alapata MS).  She plans on heading to law school after two years, but it should be a terrific experience for her.  I know George P did a similar thing.
 
My wife, Michela English, has also recently jumped into the education arena, having retired from the Discovery Channel two years ago.  She's now on a Charter School board here in DC, and recently became the CEO and President of Fight for Children, which funds project in children's education and health in the District of Columbia.  
 
And finally, my son, Will -- who just graduated from high school -- will be attending the University of Miami as a freshman starting in two weeks. 
 
So, we now have many excuses to visit our home in Orlando and Miami, too. 
 
I hope we can catch up some time.  I'd like to know what you're thinking.

Best personal regards,

    I would be interested in serving as Charlotte County Commissioner, recently vacated by Commissioner Devos, for 3 months as an appointed member. I do not come without some baggage and tend to be quite controversial in the seat I hold presently. 
    I am currently and will be during the three months, a City Commissioner in the neighboring City of North Port, where I reside. Our City has a great relationship with Charlotte County. We have shared many Capital Improvement Projects and concerns in the past.
     I do own property within Charlotte County (Murdock Village)and have no ties to the current board members or hidden agenda. I just believe it would be a great experience and it would not conflict with my current seat as they meet at different times. I have a general knowledge of the issues they are facing.

Good evening Sir,
 
My name is Deb Burnett.  I moved to Florida over three years ago to be closer to my family.  I have been a medical transcriptionist for over 11 years supporting my family.  I now have the opportunity to own my own business, but lack the funds to get it started.  The company is an existing company that I may purchase.  I would like to do so, but as I said, I lack the funds.  I have been in communication with SCORE - the Citrus County Chapter, my mother-in-law who is a grant writer, and a friend who owns her own company here in Florida.  
 
Do you know of any grants that would be available to me to pursue this awesome adventure?  I would be employing a few people who are low income and/or minority.  I am a white female and have been of low income for most of my life.  Right now, I have an employee who is white, female and disabled.  Any help you can give would be GREATLY appreciated.
 
Thank you for your time and efforts.... this too is GREATLY appreciated.

Subject:	Personnel cuts at Eglin AFB

Sir;

 

Today, most if not all workers on Eglin AFB received an e-mail from Eglin's commanding general.  This e-mail stated that 340 positions both military and civilian would be eliminated by 31 Dec 2006.  This action is authorized by PBD-720 according to the general.  He also states that this has nothing to do with the previous attempt to gut the 46th Test Wing.  It would appear to most workers that there is an on-going attempt to draw down Eglin's ability to provide the testing facilities and personnel necessary to test the new generation of smart weapons.  Senators Martinez and Nelson, and others, sponsored/wrote legislation for a through investigation on costs and effects prior to any restructuring or personnel cuts at military bases.  Is this proposal in defiance of that legislation?   If this type of action is so necessary why wasn't it included in the BRAC 2005 committee's findings?  

 

I am a 20 plus year retired U.S. Air Force veteran.  I have been retired 15 plus years and worked for the Operations and Maintenance (O & M) contractor for that entire time.  As a retired USAF E-6, my retired pay dictates that I must work a second career.  If Eglin AFB and 46th Test Wing are reduced to the point that the O & M contract is no longer required, where will the support personnel find employment that is comparable to the current salaries.  There aren't any in the local area that compare.  

 

This is my opinion and my opinion only, that the Air Force has plans to gut, cut and downsize Eglin to the point where it should be closed.  That is just my opinion.  Most of our workers have worked for the O & M contractor for many many years, some as long as 45 years plus.  There doesn't seem to be any concern that this is our lively hood.  We do not have the comfort of that 15th and 1st of the month check being there as do the military members.  Nor do we have the placement options that most civil servants will have.  We most certainly will be paying our own way if we have to move to another location, the military members do not have this worry of moving to another job.  I've been there as a military member (PCSing) and the movers took care of most of everything.  It does not work that way when a contractor loses his/hers job and has to relocate.  

 

We have all types of problems that our current leaders are working on.  Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, North Korea, Afghanistan and Iran, just to name a few.  Budget cuts are inevitable with the on-going war on terrorism, but it is time to bring our troops home from Iraq.   Let's use the money this war is costing to protect our borders, our people, correct the immigration problems and protect our jobs here at home.   

 

Please have your team investigate the proposed cuts to Eglin AFB's workforce.  Our future, and our future weapons, depends on Eglin AFB and the 46th Test Wing staying strong and open.

Subject:	small business crushed by zoning laws

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am writing to you to request an appointment to discuss the fact that zoning and code county regulations are crushing small business in Hillsborough County, FL and statewide.  

 

I have operated a dog school in Lutz, Florida for ten years.  After moving to our most recent new location, address below, I learned that zoning laws had changed. I was asked to provide a map to the county drawn by a certified Florida engineer and eventually was told that I would have to pave a driveway.  Being a small business I have no money for a map priced at 14 thousand dollars.  When I pressed the county they said I could draw my own map but insisted that I would have to add a paved driveway.  I can’t afford the money for a paved driveway.  So I opted to put my gorgeous new top notch 2300 square foot dog school up for sale as a residence.  My dog school previously was not forced to have a paved driveway, it isn’t environmental to pave a driveway but suddenly it is being forced on my small business. 

 

It seems to me that county officials and civic associations are greatly impeding small business.  Myself and others being unable to comply with the ever increasing county regulations and fees are forced to move or close our businesses. 

 

This trend appears to be statewide and dog trainers are being forced to operate “under the radar” of their counties or being forced out.  Petsmart and Petco are already putting tremendous pressures on us small business dog trainers probably soon the majority of small business dog trainers will be forced to close.  Just like other industries it will be another one run be an oligopoly.  Considering that the United States is at its core small business this seems inappropriate.  Since government will step in at some point to break up oligopolies, why not proactively prevent them from occurring by empowering small business at the county level?

 

My recommendations are:  1. Empower land owners –if you buy the land you get to decide what you want to do without the requirement of special use permits or high county fees.  Simply every county provides a list of what is allowed and not allowed in each type of zoning.  2. Apply zoning laws to the date of the purchase of the land rather then the date of the permit.  Land owners have no control over delays prior to permitting (in my case this would have saved my biz) my land was stuck in the county for over a year rendering us unable to even pull a permit for building.  

 

Since I have shared my story with my 8 thousand plus clients I have heard many other stories of the county forcing regulations – which in several cases were not even accurate – on the citizens of Hillsborough County.  Hillsborough County can’t be sued so even when they provided my attorney with false information there were no consequences for the county.  This sets citizens up to be bullied by their counties.  

 

Incidentally, it seems that code enforcement is predominately a tool for mud slinging since I was turned into the county by a competitor who is starting her own dog school across the street.  By simplifying code zoning regulations and making them less stringent on small business this dynamic would be curbed.

Subject:	Boating Education

Governor Bush,
 
As you may know, the state of Florida is #1 in the country for boating accidents.  Palm Beach County to the Keys represents the top 4 counties for boating accidents in the nation and the numbers are increasing everyday.  I love boating and I wanted to use my passion to help improve boating education and safety in the state.
 
I have worked most of my career in televison marketing for FOX television. My background in media combined with my love of boating led me to the creation of a new boating education television program designed to entertain and education boaters throughout the state.
 
To be taken seriously as a female boater, I knew I would have to do more.  I went to school and am now a United States Licensed Captain - Merchant Marine Officer - licensed for boats up to 100 tons.  
 
We have a nationally known production company retained to film the weekly episode at locations throughout Palm Beach County.  We have negotiated and secured airtime 2x weekly FOX Sports Net throughout Florida, and 2x weekly on the Travel Channel from Vero Beach to the Keyes.  
 
Each episode offers three segments:
1)  USCG Boating Education
2)  Boat Handling
3)  Water Sports
 
Our first taping is scheduled for August 19th and 20th.  We are getting tons of support from the media and the boating community, all who feel education is the key to helping with safety.  
 
As a new show we need HELP.  We believe this is such an important issue right now that we do not have time to wait.  It will take us time to get our advertising base to the point where we are completely self supportive.  We are asking at this point for emergency help getting this important show off the ground for 4th quarter 06.  
 
We have many of the expences covered by advertisers but we are still in need of $8,500 per episode for the first 13 weeks.  Is there anything the state can do to help us with the launch of this program that will help the entire state.  
 
Boating is one of our greatest revenue sources for the state.  We want boaters to be safe and have put the work in on our end to make this happen.  We need your help to make this happen.

Thank you for your consideration,

Well Thanks
That does me a lot of good there are 3 different licenses within 7 miles of my home all in Brevard County.Plus according to some I need a licence issued by each city I work in and Occupational licenses in each county. Currently working with Brevard, Broward, Dade and Palm each.
 I guess after spending weeks on this and no real head way City county or State. I should just go on Unemployment. Rather than try to do make an honest living working for myself.
 I thought Corporate politics were bad as a Director of International Operations and service for a fortune 500 company.  It was easier to get things done in China and India than it appears to be in Florida.
 
No wonder so many people work without proper licenses and we have so many illegal immigrants it clearly is easier for them doing the wrong thing's than somebody trying to do it the right way.
 
No wonder it seem that nothing can get done in Federal Politics can't even do it and come up with some consistent practices and standards at the state level.
 
 Very disappointing.
 
Should be a state licence that covers the state.

Subject:	A Success Story from Newport International :: Preserving Florida's History while Enabling Business Growth

Mr. Jeb Bush, 
 
My name is Alexandre Malaguti, Marketing Coordinator for Newport International in St. Petersburg, FL USA. Late last year (2005), the company I work for started to hunt for a new headquarter location in the Tampa Bay area. This project took Jack McGeough, CEO and Owner, on a wild race all over town. After many unsuccessful buy attempts, Mr. McGeough and his wife, Jeanne, were given a tip about an old abandoned funeral home in downtown St. Petersburg. Just the word "funeral" was enough to turn both of them off, nonetheless after some creative selling from their realtor's part, Mr. and Mrs. McGeough agreed on seeing the property. 
 
The place was literally a decrepit wood frame with walls. the place resembled a "Crack-house" (sorry for the word) more than a 1920s upscale funeral home. Nonetheless, Mrs. Jeanne's creative spark lit up after seeing the place, and with that she was able entice our company's owner and husband, Jack, to seriously consider the building as a viable option. 
 
After some research and deliberation over viability of the project, Mr. and Mrs. McGeough took it upon themselves to restore that "Funeral Crack-home," if you can call it that, into the corporate headquarters of our 50 million dollar a year company. 
 
What was thought to take months, ended up taking like a year, but finally in June 2006 our new stunning HQ was ready for business. The project was kept in line with all historic regulations, the outside now looks exactly like the original 1920s design, and the interior houses an immense elegant office space for 20 employees. The beauty of the building and its multifunctional design puts it on a league of its own.
 
After reading about the historic safeguarding efforts of our first lady through Preserve America, those of History Channel with "Save Our History" and those of other national and state entities, I have come to realize how relevant our company's initiative, and that of the owners, is. Such bold move of restoring a ran-down funeral home into a modern, yet historic, corporate office space exemplifies the spirit of the great works been carried nationwide. 
 
Please accept my invitation to our official Ribbon Cutting Celebration in Downtown St. Petersburg Florida, August 30th 2006.  Mr. Rick Baker, Mayor of St. Petersburg, will be in attendance a long with The Tampa Tribune, St. Petersburg Times and other local news agencies. 
 
Lets make the dream of preserving America a reality in our education, businesses and personal lifes.
 
For more information, or to confirm your attendance, please call 727-866-1188 ext 209, or email me at alex@newportintl.com

Dear Governor Bush:

 

My son, Timothy W. Keck, of Indian Harbour Beach, Florida recently became an Eagle Scout.  

 

His multi-phase project was for the benefit of Loggerhead Preserve in Melbourne Beach.  Timmy led approximately 50 volunteers to remove non-native and invasive vines from the over-grown preserve.  Then, he supervised the planting of approximately 50 new native plants he purchased with funds that were donated to the project by individual supporters.  With money Timmy raised from a plant sale fundraiser, materials were purchased to create plaques with the scientific and common names for the native plants at the Preserve.  Tim coordinated the construction and installation of the plaques.  Finally, Timmy prepared seasonal, educational information for the existing bulletin board.

 

Timothy is currently a student at Satellite High School.  He is a varsity wrestler and is on the varsity football team.  He has been a member of Boy Scout Troop 380 for almost 7 years.  During the summer he works as a Red Cross certified lifeguard and swim instructor for Brevard County Parks and Recreation.  He is an active member of our church.

 

We would be honored if you would be the keynote speaker at his Court of Honor on September 10th at 4pm.  Please let me know if you are able to be there and I will provide directions.  If you are not available, we’d appreciate a congratulatory letter that could be presented to Timmy.  Thank you.

 

Sincerely,

Mr. Governer Bush,
                        I'm writing this to see if we can solve this problem of concern. I have been informed that theres's a possibilitythat i might be able to get this persons criminal background history removed if  I  talk to you. These infractions accured approximately between the years of 1983-1989. I would greatly appreciate any assistance that you might could give me concerning this matter. I'm a christian person and have seen and talked to this person and he is a really close friend of mine and it really bothers me to see all of these people on the streets commit crimes and get punished for the crimes and then be set free and go out and do the same thing over again. This person has completed what he needed to do and he has not been in any trouble since 1989. Don't you think sir that this person deserves a second chance? This person has convinced me that the infractions accured were when he was young and that he has changed his life for the good. He has turned his life around raising his two kids as a single father trying to make ends meat from picking oranges all of his life. I'm hopeing you will give this a second look and see what I mean. If you have time please just pull his background and see for yourself. This is a person that really deserves a second chance to be able to get a better paying job. the information youneed to look up will be at the end of this e-mail.  Thank you for all of your time and cooperation.
                             Respectfully,

Being an African American, I am just lost for words. Not just because the African Americans are mostly committing these crimes, but it's unbelievable of why this is happening. 
I'm a single parent of a teenager, living in a nice subdivision and no matter how much you instill into these teenagers, they are determine to do just what they want to do.

Dear Governor Bush: 

I am writing to urge you to appoint Tara Pascotto Paluck to the open county court judge position in Lee County.  

I know Ms. Paluck on both a professional and personal level.  It is my firm conviction that we need more judges with “real life” trial experience and law practice experience prior to their appointment to the bench.  Ms. Paluck has that experience.  She began her career as a prosecutor and later switched to a career in insurance defense.  More recently she has been a certified mediator and handled her own practice which included a large majority of family law cases.  I am confident that she will be a valuable member of our judiciary.

Should you wish to discuss Ms. Paluck in greater detail, please contact me.

Governor Bush,

 

This e-mail is to express my support for the appointment of Tara Pascotto Paluck to the Lee County Bench.  

 

Tara was one of the first attorneys I met shortly after I moved to the area while attending a Lee County Women’s Lawyers Association function in Naples and I was impressed by her wide variety of legal experience.  Tara is active in both the legal community and local community and I believe that she will be an asset to the Lee County Bench.

Dear Governor Bush:

I read that you have recently appointed a 15 member committee to make  
recommendations on possible real property tax reforms.

I am a thirty-five year Hawaii resident who is a non-resident Florida  
homeowner. My wife and I own an Englewood home that was built by my  
grandfather in 1950 and was owned by my mother until we purchased it  
from her in 2002 when she became ill with Alzheimer's Disease.

I am very interested in the work of your property property tax  
committee partly because the property tax bill on our Florida home  
has risen from $10,000 in 2002 to $33,000 in 2005, and partly because  
I served on a similar property tax reform committee on my home island  
of Kauai in 2004 - 2005.

I thought that the Florida property tax committee might be interested  
in the the property tax reform proposal from our Kauai committee.  
There are many similarities between the property tax situation in  
Florida and, on a smaller scale, ours here on Kauai.

I would appreciate it if your staff could provide me with information  
regarding how to contact the Governor's Property Tax Committee in  
order to share some information. Thank you.

Aloha,

Jeb - I know this email is a little dated, but I think I missed it the first time.  Anyway, why can't the state be first in having corporations who do business here internalize the cost of products discussed.  This will provide them with incentives for becoming a more sustainable business and the taxpayer doesn't have to foot the bill through more bureaucracy. Hasn't Tim Center with the Sustainable Florida group come up with some solutions by now? Take care.

Subject: The Need for Better Disposal of "e-waste"



http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/3154

A number of toxic substances are used in of electronics, from the liquid
crystal displays on cell phones to the circuit boards inside computers. The
lead, used in glass panels of computer monitors, in soldering of printed
circuit boards and in cell phones, can leach from landfills and contaminate
drinking water. In addition to negatively affecting brain development in
children, the toxin can cause nervous- and blood-system damage as well as
kidney problems. Lead constitutes more than half of the 70 percent of
consumer electronics contribution of heavy-metal waste in US landfills.

Cadmium, another toxin that damages the kidneys, is used in computer-chip
resistors, semiconductors and cell phones’circuitry, batteries and liquid
crystal displays. Mercury, used in circuit boards, medical equipment and cell
phones, can accumulate in people, animals and plants, leading to brain
damage. And brominated flame retardants (BFRs), used in the plastic casings
of computers, televisions and cell phones, increase risk of cancer.

Chad Raphael, professor at Santa Clara University and chair of the Silicon
Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC), said "We have to stop sweeping our toxic
trash under other people's rugs."

Westervelt said that with municipalities scrambling to keep the
electronic-waste stream out of landfills, local officials are concerned that
if they charge to recycle toxic electronics, consumers will illegally dump
the materials or continue to store them in their homes and businesses.
"I talk with hundreds of recyclers around this country and they all say the
same thing –which is you cannot responsibly process this waste stream without
charging or without having some sort of revenue coming in," said Westervelt,
adding that it costs between $10 to $30 to properly recycle each computer or
TV.

In the absence of federal leadership on e-waste, states are passing their own
laws, which discourages recyclers from creating a national electronic
recycling system.

However, local store outlets of national chains can be required to set up
"drop off" points for the manufacturers of the equipment they sell, to be
returned in bulk to the manufacturer for safe disassembly, recycling, and
disposal.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor 
State of Florida
 
Dear Governor Bush, 
 
As you know our daughter, Tara Pascotto Paluck, is applying for the appointed position for Lee County Court Judge previously held by Judge Volz. As parents we know Tara will be quite an effective judge. She is smart, ethical, energetic, and hard working.  Tara desires to further her commitment to her community as she and her husband, Ron, are raising their two boys in Fort Myers.  She feels that it is time to give back at the highest level that she can achieve. 

 

We have been in Fort Myers for 31 years. Tara was raised here. She graduated valedictorian from Canterbury School.  Then, she graduated from Notre Dame majoring in American Studies.  After Notre Dame, she went to Creighton University Law School where she founded the Health Law Association. For both her undergraduate and graduate studies, Tara earned Dean’s List honors.  After graduating in 1994, she returned to Fort Myers and worked at the State Attorney's Office. There, she gained an excellent reputation working in the courtroom primarily handling Domestic Violence and Narcotics/Firearm cases. Subsequently, she did insurance defense work for Allstate for 8 years. Approximately one year ago, Tara opened a general law practice doing a significant amount of family law.  In 2004, Tara was certified by the Supreme Court of Florida as a mediator in county and circuit court cases.  She has mediated cases in all areas of law. 

 

Tara has actively volunteered in many local organizations including American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life, Ronald McDonald House, Lee County’s Restitution Accountability Board for juvenile offenders, and the Notre Dame Club of Lee County as president.  She participates with the Florida Association of Women Lawyers and is a board member of the Historic Edison Park Neighborhood Association.  Recently, Tara was invited to serve on the Board of Trustees for Canterbury School.

 

Tara has seen the community grow and she knows what it takes to be a effective judge  in Lee County. Her qualifications speak for themselves. 

 

Thank you for your consideration.

 

Sincerely yours,

Joan and Robert Pascotto MD

 

PS I established the cardiac surgical program here in Fort Myers in July 1975 and like Tara we feel it is time to give back.  Please find enclosed a copy of a letter that you sent me for my work in the Dominican Republic.

The Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor
Tallahassee, Florida
 
August 6, 2006
 
Re: Clemency
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to you today as the father of a son that has had a troubled life.  My son is James Steven Keller, DC# 114579.  He is presently incarcerated in Sumter Correctional Institute at Bushnell.  He was found guilty of vehicular homicide and was originally sentenced to thirty years.  Subsequently, James was granted a re-trial by the Appellate-Court.   Instead of the re-trial, he elected to take a plea bargain of twenty years, which he is currently serving.  There are many circumstances, events and history germane to this case, but in the interest of brevity I will await instructions from you as to the extent of detail required.
 
It is important for you to know that James is thirty-six years old and is and always has been a hard worker.  He has many trade-skills and can be a productive citizen.  Unfortunately, James has an addictive personality with an alcohol and drug stained past going back to his middle teens.  Almost without exception, his run-ins with the law have stemmed from substance abuse.
 
There is no excuse for what my son has done or the life that he took.  Furthermore, there is no excuse for him leaving the scene of the accident or refusing to turn himself in as we all instructed him to do.  All that can be said is that he was afraid and coupled with the alcohol and drug abuse the other side of the equation equaled cowardice.
 
James Steven Keller was sexually molested, along with an older mentally-challenged girl at Westwinds Mobile Home Park in Bradenton by David Toby. James was seven years old at the time.  We were told at the time of this molestation that James could develop social behavioral problems later in his life.  These types of problems started to manifest themselves about three years later when his step father passed away.  Immaturity and coping failures have plagued James his whole life.   However, at the end of the day, the tragic death of Chris Klueh, 12/21/2000, was an accident.  My son did not set out to kill anyone.
 
I have prayed and worried over this plea more than anything I have ever done.  I decided to ask for your help because I firmly believe that I can help my son assimilate productively back into society.  However if he serves out his current sentence the likelihood of my participation is slim.
 
Having met you on several occasions over the years, I was left with the sense that you are a genuinely compassionate man.  I ask only that you look into James’ prison record.  You will see that he has an exemplary deportment and work history.  He is assigned to a print shop, tool-room supervisory position.  This is a position of trust and responsibility normally given to prisoners with a much longer track record.
 
Several people in the penal system have noted that James is out of place.  Meaning he is not a hardened criminal.  My son is not a violent person and when he is sober he is a good man with a kind heart.
 
Please consider clemency for my son and let me help him move back into our society.  I don’t know if I am going about this petition the right way, so please forgive my ignorance and let me know if there is a specific procedure.  
 
I thank you Governor Bush for your time and kind attention.
 
Sincerely:
 
 
James Richard Keller

Honorable Jeb Bush

Governor

State of Florida

 

Please accept this letter as an endorsement of Tara Pascotto Paluck for the vacant Lee County Court Judge seat previously held by Judge Volz.  As a 31 year resident of Lee County I have had the fortune to know Tara’s parents throughout that journey and witness her education, community service, and professional development journey through the years.  I have also had the opportunity to see her professional demeanor in a court setting in a confident, competent, caring, focused, calming, and decisive manner.  Coupled with her strong family values excellent educational and legal experience, Tara will serve Lee County well as its next appointed judge.   

 

As CEO of Lee Memorial Health System, I have appreciated Tara’s volunteer service for Ronald McDonald House and the close affiliation with Lee Memorial’s Children’s Hospital of Southwest Florida.   Tara’s years of experience in the areas of domestic violence, narcotic and firearms, family law, and insurance cases coupled with her work with the State Attorney’s Office as well as mediator for county and circuit court cases fully position her as a well-rounded, superbly qualified County Judge.  

 

Governor Bush, you will see from Tara’s references, qualifications from the local review body, and Tara’s education and experiences that Tara Pascotto Paluck is prepared and ready to be a great judge for the 20th Circuit.  We would be honored to learn of your decision to appoint Tara to this important vacancy.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
The Capitol

400 South Monroe Street

Tallahassee, FL 32399

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I read with interest this morning about your authorization to send state troopers to help with Jacksonville’s Operation Road Block North to reduce the high murder rate they are experiencing this year.  We applaud your innovative approach to problem solving.

 

I am writing this letter to introduce you to DNA Labs International and to request a meeting with you or an appropriate member of your staff so that we may discuss how we can work together to help solve more crimes in Jacksonville and the rest of Florida.

 

DNA Labs International is a private, ISO 17025 Accredited Forensic Serology and DNA Identity testing laboratory located in South Florida.  Our mission is to help clients solve cases by providing timely, accurate and cost effective DNA testing results.  Our laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art technology and we are the only private lab with ABC Board Certified Scientists.  Our Lab Director has 25 years of forensic serology and DNA experience working in state and county crime labs. 

 

As a Florida corporation we are focused on assisting all law enforcement agencies within the state.  We have been contacted by people in many law enforcement agencies around the state that are frustrated with the current turnaround times and are looking for a solution to the DNA casework backlog problem.  

 

We believe we can offer you a win-win-win-win situation…for the People of Florida, for the law enforcement agencies, for FDLE and for us.  We guarantee all of our clients a two week turnaround time for their cases.  The local law enforcement agencies set the priorities by submitting evidence in the order they want cases worked.  We work the samples and return the DNA reports and evidence back to the agencies or FDLE - whichever they decide.  FDLE reviews the case then enters the DNA profiles into the state database and into CODIS. CODIS enables federal, state, and local crime labs to exchange and compare DNA profiles electronically, thereby linking crimes to each other and to convicted offenders.  Since private labs cannot directly input data into the system, it is important to have FDLE’s cooperation for cases that have no known suspect identified.

 

This scenario greatly reduces the amount of work for FDLE as the average time it takes to review a DNA case is only about 30 minutes versus one to two weeks and more to work an entire case from start to finish.

 

I am sure you have many questions, and we would be happy to discuss with you some of our very workable ideas on how to implement this process. Your influence with local legislators and FDLE would be valuable to make this plan successful.

 

We look forward to hearing from someone on your staff in the near future.

 

Kind regards,

Well I almost met you....again.
When you visited Neil Armstrong Elementary School, Is a teacher of the year finalist I was chosen to escort you to the media center...I was conducting speech therapy in a classroom and  they could not find me. No one told me I was to do so, until after the fact.
Again, at the Teacher of the Year Gala/Roundtable held in Orlando last month, I saw you, was in line to ask you a questions, but you had to depart...I was so close.
As the Teacher of the Year for Charlotte County, I thought for sure I would be able to meet you this time.
None the less, I live five minutes from Boca Grande and my husband is a Broker out on the island. He see you every time you and your family vacation there. So maybe this winter when you are there, I will be able to meet you, snap a photo and say..."finally".

Governor Jeb Bush, 
 
I recently made a trip to Jacksonville, FL to sell a boat to a prespective buyer, and while waiting at the marina, decided to have a beer in a bar called Jackie's Seafood.  As I was enjoying my beer,  a couple of women came and sat next to me.  Although I wasn't particularly listening to their conversation, I could tell they were regulars in this bar and possibly even worked there.  I asked these women if they knew where I could find a local notary to complete the sale of my boat, since it was the weekend and I was not from the area.  Crazy as it may sound, this prompted a very interesting and quite disturbing conversation that I feel impelled to tell you about.  I will try to be as brief as possible.
 
When asked about the notary, one woman did not hesitate to tell me that one of the bartenders in this bar, Bonnie Parks, was a notary.  She went on to say that Bonnie also worked as a bail bond at Bill Dye Bail Bonds and should have no problem meeting me on the weekend.  Before I could thank her for the information, the other woman spoke up and asked if Bonnie was still a notary after all that "crap with Carla and the Governor's office".  The first woman said, "oh yea, all that was dropped after Bonnie sent in our statements - remember?"   Of course I immediately saw a red flag and asked if this Bonnie person was legitimate.  The first woman said yes, and went on to tell me that several years ago, Bonnie and someone named Carla were real good friends and Carla was going through a bad divorce.  Apparently Carla was trying to sell some property that she hadn't disclosed in the divorce before the former husband found out.  As with most property, she needed the husband's signature before she could sell it and obviously could not go to him to get it.  According to these women, Carla signed her husband's name and asked Bonnie to notarize it for her.  As unethical as it may be, Bonnie did.  Unfortunately, the husband found out and filed a complaint against Bonnie with the Governor's office.  According to these 2 women, this "freaked Bonie out" and she was afraid she would be charged with a felony as well as lose her job at the bail bond.  So, Bonnie and Carla got their friends and relatives together and came up with a plan.  They decided they would say that Carla and her former husband came to Jackie's Seafood to sign the papers and therefore they could have witnesses to the signing.  They then had everyone write a notarized statement to this effect and Bonnie sent the fraudulent statements in to the Governor's office as proof of her "innocence".  Apparently it worked because the complaint was dropped.  
 
As I sat in horror at the total lack of integrity in these two women, who were obviously a part of this plan, as well as with Bonnie and Carla,  the first woman went on to tell me that Carla was now a bail bond as well and perhaps she was also a notary - she wasn't sure.  Then as luck would have it, she wrote down both women's names and place of employment so that I could contact them for my boat sale (like that was going to happen). 
 
               Bonnie Parks - Bill Dye Bail Bond
               Carla Pegg - 1st Coast Bail Bond
  
Needless to say, this scared me to death.  Not only was one notary with no ethics stilll allowed notary priveleges but now possibly two.  I'm sure things like this happen all the time, yet I could not understand why your office dropped the complaint without any further investigation, so I pursued the matter a little further and said, "well I guess Carla must have done a good job on the forgery if no one could tell that it wasn't her X-husband's".  To this they both kind of laughed and said, "that was the part that freaked Bonnie out, 'cuz the signature didn't look like his at all".  So I said, "well, then I guess Bonnie got lucky."  The first woman said, "yea, and I think she learned her lesson because she and Carla aren't really friends anymore".  Then the second woman said, "yea, and if I remember correctly the Governor's office sent Bonnie a letter saying she should hire an attorney - like she was the victim."  I laughed amusingly, thanked both women for the information and left the bar. 
 
Like I said, I was very disturbed by this story and although I think it is probably common for a friend to "help another friend", I could not let it go.  Basically in the time it took for me to drink a full beer, I had heard of several laws that had been broken...starting with this Carla Pegg woman not disclosing personal assets in a divorce and ending with fraudulent statements submitted in an investigation.  Not too mention, a sworn notary violating her ethical duties, and swearing a forged signature was legitimate then convincing her friends to also perjure themselves.  The most outrageous part; however, is the office of the Governor basically condoning this behavior and suggesting Ms. Parks was innocent.  I couldn't help but wonder how many times this has happened not only with these two women but with all notaries.  Seems funny that in this day and age, the Governor's office would not take the time to look more closely at a legitimate complaint from someone claiming their signature has been forged and notarized.  I'm sure the Governor's office has access to all this man's records including his driver's license - if there was any difference in the signatures, it should have been pursued. I realize your office is busy but how much time would that possibly take?  Isn't it better to err on the side of caution then to allow such a travesty to happen?   
 
Maybe I have too much time on my hands, but I spent a little time working as a Private Investigator and all these thoughts intriqued me to take a look myself at the public record in Duval County and see what I could find.  I found that Carla Pegg's former husband's name is Mark Pegg, and several documents containing both his signature and Carla Pegg's signature on public record.  Then I found not one but two Affidavits dated April 10,  2002 notarized by Ms. Bonnie Parks that do not match the other signatures on file for Mr. Pegg.  As a matter of fact, they bear quite a resemblence to Ms. Pegg's signature.  Mr. Pegg's official signature looks more like "Mil O Pegg" than Mark D. Pegg as it is easily read on the forged affidavits.  Obviously the public records department has had trouble reading his name because he is listed as Mark A. Pegg and Mark O. Pegg in addition to Mark D. Pegg.  After viewing this for myself, I have to believe the story I heard in Jackie's Seafood is 100% true.  
 
Therefore, all I can say is I'm appalled and completely outraged that your office has condoned breaking the law on several counts and blatently ignored a legitimate complaint by Mr. Pegg whose civil rights were violated by his former wife and her notary friend.  I am unsure of the reasons behind your office's decision to ignore this complaint but luckily for you, this wasn't my problem because I would have been a richer man today.  If I could see a difference in the signatures, surely you could too.  I have to assume that the Governor's office doesn't care about the general public in Florida and it is no wonder there is such a problem with identity theft. Apparently all the "hype" about stopping identity theft in this country is nothing but typical political bullshit.  
 
I have attached copies of the documents I retrieved from public records in Duval County for your review.  Although I'm sure you will probably not give this matter any more consideration than you did when the official complaint was made - I suggest you take a look yourself.  All I can say is thank goodness I live in Georgia and do not have to depend on you or your office for anything.  The one Bush I do have to deal with is bad enough!

Dear General Kostelnik,

 

It was a pleasure to finally see you again. Glad to hear that your post-NASA position is proving rewarding and fulfilling. 

 

My attached résumé reflects a varied and valuable professional background: more than 30 years as an award-winning creative force in broadcast journalism and promotions, as well as public affairs exposure on the front-lines of international breaking news, an experience we shared at NASA Headquarters in the aftermath of the Columbia tragedy. I’ve also helped media train high-ranking NASA executives, as well as employees of a Fortune 500 corporation.

 

As a team member in a creative and employee-friendly culture, I'd utilize my unique skills set to develop strategic internal and external messaging plans, tools and products promoting a company or organization's image and driving productivity. These might include, but wouldn’t be limited to, conceptualizing, writing and producing videos and audio/visual programming and materials.

 

In short, whatever the medium or venue, I’ll deliver the message accurately, entertainingly and compellingly, with heart and passion.

 

My wife, infant daughter and I are ready to relocate for the right challenge. Once more, thanks for your generosity in “spreading the word,” and I’ll follow up with you soon.

 

Sincerely,

 

Al Feinberg

Hello,

My name is Herb Stewart . I am the Plant Manager of a
medium sized company called William Andrews Designs.
We are currently based in Opa Locka Florida. 

I recently learned that The owner of our company has
planned to relocate the Company to Mexico. We are a
company of about 35 employees. 

I have been tasked with the job of keeping this
company here no matter what it takes. There are
families and peoples lives at stake here. 

I would like to know are there any grants that I could
qualify for to help keep these people employed and to
keep our company here in Florida. If I have to start a
new company manufacturing the stone tables I will. 

I am prepared to take our cause anywhere that I feel
it will benefit our way of life and the lively hood of
our dieing company. I do not want to fail all of these
people as they have placed this responsibilty in my
hands.      

My idea is to form another company with borrowed funds
of Government grants. 

I need help.

Governor Bush,
 
As I working with several other people to rebuild and expand (we are all volunteers) the Desoto County,  Arcadia All-Florida Rodeo arena and facility. I would like to thank your office for making the $30,000 feasibility grant money possible. Thank You. 
   
Stop and Think!
If a Hurricane, Natural disaster, Terrorist attack happened is SW Florida........The most logical emergency command center and hub would be an Equestrian show facility's with Rail Road access, which is what we are building.......WHY ?????........these Equestrian show facilities have, as part of their normal components,  which become key elements needed in a disaster recovery situation. a) several hundred acres close to town: that could be used for staging-up equipment and housing manpower (in tents), b) Multiple bath room/ shower buildings scattered across the grounds: that could be used to keep quality of life and sanitary conditions for man power and evacuees, c) Exhibit Halls: which could be used to be used as office space, cafeteria, medical offices, dry supply storage. d) Horse stalls and Dog/ cat kennels: which could be used as pet shelter, animal control offices, military and police dog housing and emergency veterinarian care. e) Main Stadium 9,000 seats plus a large arena floor space, office space w/privet bath rooms and showers, sky boxes and conference rooms: This could be used as  housing, information briefings to evacuees, supplies, communication center and accommodations for key emergency manager personnel. f) RV park area's (300 water, sewer and electric hook ups: This will allow instant housing for key personal and their families with no set up time, pull the RV or Travel trailer up and plug in. g) The Rail Road spur and station: This could be used to connect SW Florida to the rest of the country,  with the most efficient method of mass transportation known. you could move supplies or people North or South, thousands at a time and per hour.  you could even evacuate people from south Florida,  hub them in Desoto county and then bring them to any place in the country.  Consider the possibilities     
 
Our concept 
is to build a several hundred acre equestrian and rodeo facility with mostly private funds. The facility would be owned and operated sole by the 80 year old "not for profit", organization, the "All- Florida Championship rodeo" currently run by President Judge, Don T Hall of Arcadia. The completion of this faculties will preserve the agriculture industry in our area by promoting agriculture events and allowing our Florida students to show animals, participate in agriculture functions. This facility would impacts the community with job, tourism, economic development during normal weather and when a storm threatened or hit, the facility would be turned over to the Desoto County emergency management team or FEMA.to use as they see fit..... This would be one of the only PET Friendly shelters in our area and even possibly regionally. Now add the idea of an EVACUATION TRAIN, this could be a great way to become part of a net work of shelters connected by the Rail Road. 
    The Icing on the cake is that we have interest from the world famous circus "Ringling brothers" circus who has a genuine interest in making Desoto County their winter Quarters. This will promote Florida tourism across the united states and will certainly significantly impact the economy of our town which is only 2 hours from Orlando's Disney world. 
 
 
This e-mail is to ask you to please appoint one or more staff members to our board of advisors for this project. We would like the governors office to be involved in the planning of our facility. we fee this facility will become a key resource for the state during disaster recovery, on a local and regional level ...As you know we will need the support experience of every one we can to make this project work. By appointing just one person to our board of advisors.......even if they never attend one meeting in person, You could single handedly catapult this project to instant success.......

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would like to urge you to attend the Awareness Day Event at Intercourse Community Park, 3529 Old Philadelphia Pik, Leacock Township, PA. on Saturday, September 16, 2006 from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM.  Although I do not live in Pennsylvania, dogs from those mills often end up in our state and cost taxpayers thousands of dollars in veterinary bills, shelters or to euthanize, not to mention the heartbreak of seeing the suffering these animals live with.  Please consider attending to learn about what occurs in these mills.  As the Governor of our state, I look to you to help solve the problem of breeding dogs for profit without them having the necessities to live and thrive.  These animals live in their own waste, often are left without water or food and live through heat and cold with no reprieve.  When they are released by the millers, they are blind, crippled, starving, matted, physically and mentally broken down animals that have spent their whole lives in filthy cages!!!  Until you understand the scope, you can't begin to resolve the problem.  I am begging you to please attend and help us to change the laws forever!!

My name is Dave Edwards and I am the Senior Vice President for Cardinal Logistics Management.  We are a logistics company with major operations in the State of Florida.  Without going into great detail, we provide dedicated transportation (trucking) for our contract customers.  One of our accounts recently achieved a milestone in the industry.  Our 24 drivers at this account have collectively reached 1,000,000 miles operating in Florida without an accident.  The article below provides the details.

 

Here are my questions.

 

1)       Would you like to attend the safety celebration we are planning to honor these drivers?

2)       Could you send some type of letter to each of the drivers congratulating them on their achievement?

3)       Could you send one letter to the account that can be read at the safety celebration congratulating them on their achievement?

 

Once I receive your response, I can provide all of the required details.

 

I wouldn’t ask this of you as I know you’re very busy, however, with all of the negative press the industry receives in general; I thought this might be a good time to highlight a very positive achievement by a great group.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hughes Supply Orlando Reaches One Million Miles Accident Free 


By Bryan Alford, Operations Manager


 



It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Hughes Supply Orlando Florida location has surpassed the One Million mile mark without a preventable accident. Many people have worked very hard to make this possible. This account is over 6 years old and this is the first time that I am aware of. The drivers here are 100% responsible for attaining this goal. They turned every mile, made every stop, did every drop and hook. All I did was keep track of it and hand out the accolades. Lewis Johnson, Dan Goodall, Brannon Morse, and John Nagle continued to preach the message every time they could until it became second nature. Florida Operations Managers Mark Hadley, Larry Ott, Cameron Hyde, and their staff provided us with quality drivers when we needed help and kept the safety ball rolling. Through their commitment to safety, teamwork, customer satisfaction, and a genuine care for each other’s performance, they have won a long overdue reward.

Many of the drivers cover more miles than the next, some run local, OTR, and regional. This was a team effort from not only the Hughes drivers, but also surrounding Orlando Metro accounts. Drivers from Georgia Pacific, Office Depot, CHEP Pallets, and Mills Pride participated in pushing us over the top. This is a testimony to those drivers and their leaders. Preaching safety is easy, sitting down with a driver and talking about safety is easy, holding them accountable is easy, and celebrating this goal will be sweet. We worked on safety one stop, mile, day, week, and month at a time. Each of them supported the other with encouragement, positive attitudes, and a common goal they all wanted to achieve. 

Each month at our safety meeting we sit down and have breakfast together. We talk about safety and operational issues, and I give each of them an opportunity to have the floor to discuss anything they see we need to improve on. We've had many suggestions from them that we've implemented and practiced. Each one of the drivers knows they can count on the other to do his/her job today to the fullest. They know that their teammates are just as concerned as they are about safety. We require them to hold us as supervisors and managers, just as accountable for safety as we hold them. We expect to be told of equipment issues and they expect us to correct it. Each Friday we have a weekly safety cookout. No accidents mean burgers, hot dogs, chicken, maybe even a steak and potato. We are most definitely on "the better we do, the better we eat" program. 

I couldn't be more proud of a group of drivers than the ones I work with today. They are truly a great bunch of people who have fun together and know that Cardinal does care about them and their families. They know that we practice what we preach, even when it's tough, and are honest and fair. We trust them and they trust us. We've reached our goal together and will continue to strive further...the tough part is figuring out how to celebrate. Maybe I'll put on a grass skirt and do the hula at a luau for them. 

Thanks for the hard work and dedication to all of the drivers that got us to this goal!

The following is a letter to be sent by Mayor Tammy C. Moore, Mayor of the City of Belleview.  

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

September 11, 2006 will be the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks that took the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens   Last year, in Washington, DC, the Department of Defense held the first annual America Supports You Freedom Walk. The purpose of the America Supports You Freedom Walk is to establish a national tradition to reflect on the lives lost on September 11, 2001, to renew our commitment to freedom and the values of our country, and to show our gratitude for our military men and women, past and present, who commit to protecting our freedom.

 

This year, at the request of people from around the nation, the America Supports You Freedom Walk is being expanded to include the entire country.  The City of Belleview has been contacted and is organizing an America Supports You Freedom Walk to be held Monday, September 11, 2006.  The opening ceremony and program will begin at 6:00 PM, followed by the walk and an evening in the park, located next to Belleview City Hall.  

 

On behalf of the City of Belleview, I would like to invite you to speak at the opening ceremony and join us in the walk.  Your presence would mean so much to the family members in the area who have lost loved ones, not only in the terrorist attack of September 11th, but also those men and women, past and present, serving in our military.  Please give this request your utmost consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 

Sincerely,

 

Tammy C. Moore

Mayor

Dear Governor Bush
 
You have done simple a great job for the state of Florida, and I wish you could remain Governor.... But, perhaps President??
 
I am writing because I received a flyer from Tom Gallagher for Gov...  and the add struck me as odd.  It shows you with Mr Gallagher twice, (it never states so in the flyer) but it gives the impression that you endorse him (Mr Gallagher).  If this is not the case (that you endorse him) I think it is a slick and misleading add!!!   We as a party need to be together to keep Florida republican controlled, but this certainly is not the way...  conservative values don't run in this direction.
 
I am CC'ing this letter to Mr Gallagher, and to Mr Charlie Crist

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
We have another problem with one of our elected school board members, that was originally appointed by you.  In the past year or so Kurt Kelly, in my opinion and the opinion of others in public office has abused his position as a school board member and become involved in criminal matters pertaining to students in the school system.  The latest incident involves three Forest High School Varsity football players that were arrested for attempted arm robbery with a loaded 357 magnum.  They have confessed to the crime and the gun was obtained by the students while in the football locker room on school grounds.  The school system has a zero tolerance policy for guns and have arrested a 5 year old for having a water pistol in her gym bag.  Mr. Kelly along with the football coach, who is the superintendents brother, spoke at a hearing which would decide whether the defendants would be released or remanded until the trial.  The recommendation of the Department of Juvenile Justice was that these kids should be remanded, the recommendation of the State Attorney was the same.  Mr. Kelly along with others spoke in the behalf of the defendants and the judge decided to let them go free until the trial.  Mr. Kelly did not inform any of the school board members of his plans to speak in regards to this matter and most our outraged that these violent criminals are out on our streets.  Furthermore these kids are still enrolled in our public education system and currently participating in summer workouts on public school property.  It is obvious that Mr. Kelly is taking matters into his own hands and running wild in our county.  Since you appointed Mr. Kelly to this position originally you obviously know him well enough to speak with him.  Could you please talk with Mr. Kelly and ask him to stop meddling in the justice system.  We have good police officers that are doing a fine job but every time a student that Mr. Kelly knows gets in trouble he gets involved and causes conflict in the community.  Mr. Kelly touts himself as a conservative republican but he is making it difficult for us to continue to elect go solid conservatives when one of your own, Gov. Bush, is running amuck.

Subject: Computer-based Accommodations


Governor Bush-
Thank you for taking the time to meet with Tom, Pat, and me yesterday.  
While on the plane back to Boston, Tom and I gave much thought to your 
questions regarding the open-ended items on the FCAT math and science 
tests, and we came up with two solutions.

Regarding how to allow students to show their work or record drawings 
on a computer, we have a simple and inexpensive hardware solution that 
will allow students to "write" on paper using a "pen" and have their 
responses recorded on the computer.  If implemented, this solution 
would enable every item found in the released tests to be administered 
on computer and would greatly decrease the cost associated with 
scanning in paper sheets that are then scored electronically.

Your second concern related to the time and cost associated with 
scoring the open-response items.  For many of the items, we have an 
inexpensive solution that will decrease the time associated with 
scoring many of theses items by 50-80%, depending on the item.  Rather 
than developing sophisticated algorithms that build on artificial 
intelligence, our idea capitalizes on existing tools and algorithms.  
While this solution would not work for items that require students to 
draw pictures, it would work for any item that requires students to 
write an explanation or record a final solution.

We are testing out these two ideas now and should be able to provide 
more information about their feasibility in about a week.

As a final note, I want to provide some additional information about 
Tom and I.  During our meeting, you mentioned some studies that the 
DOE's chief psychometrician had referenced regarding differential 
performance on computers and on paper.  Ten years ago, I began 
conducting research on this issue and I suspect she is referring to 
some of my work which has focused on computer- versus paper-based 
writing tests.  Following this initial work, I founded the Technology 
and Assessment Study Collaborative (inTASC), which works with schools 
and state organizations to explore ways that computers can be used to 
enhance testing.  As part of our research, we have partnered with a few 
states to explore ways computers can be used to provide accommodations. 
  For this work, we have had to create computer-based tests that include 
specific accommodation tools.  These and other tools we have created 
for research purposes have been received favorably by schools and state 
organizations, which have inquired about using them.  Believing that 
research is only useful if it is applied, and frustrated that the 
larger testing companies seemed to resist some of the new innovations 
we were exploring, Tom and I formed Nimble Assessment Systems in order 
to refine these tools and make them available to educational 
organizations.  While many companies conduct research regarding their 
products, Nimble's tools are direct products of formal, federally 
funded research.

Again, thank you for your time yesterday and for spurring us to think 
deeply about two important challenges faced by computer-based testing.

Good morning Governor Bush,

Last year Navy Child and Youth Programs’ annual CYP Professionals conference was held in Orlando, FL. and because we had such a great time, we’ve decide to visit Orlando again this year.  This year’s conference will be held November 27th through December 1st, , 2007 and there will be approximately 250 Navy Child and Youth Program Professionals attending from Navy programs world wide.  

I’m sure that you are aware of the importance of Child and Youth Programs to our military families.  Our military families rely on the kind of quality Child Development, School Age and Youth programming we provide for their children so that they can accomplish their mission as military members whether it is on board the installation or as a war fighter overseas. Knowing that their children are cared for in a safe and caring environment and are provided quality programming helps them meet their mission. Our annual conference brings Navy Child and Youth Professionals together each year for essential training seminars, networking and round table talks to keep us abreast of the latest information and innovations in the Child and Youth field and to provide us with the tools needed to continue providing the highest quality programs possible for our military families.

Because of your continuing support of our Nation’s military members and their families and your father, President George Bush was a decorated Navy pilot, we are hoping you will accept an invitation to be our Keynote speaker at this year’s conference.  The first day of the conference is November 27; however, if this date does not fit into your calendar, we would be delighted to accommodate you at anytime during the conference.

Since this is an informal request via e-mail, please let me know of any formal procedures required to request your attendance at our conference.  I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I have applied for my notary and it was denied because of a mistake I made almost 2 years ago. I was not found guilty of a felony, yet on the bottom of my application the office of International Affairs marked me as a felon. I sent in all the documentation for my pre-trial intervention that I completed. 
I am trying to move on with my life from this mistake, I have done everything asked of me by the state and have not renewed my nursing license as I want to pursue a carrier in Insurance and Bonds with my mother, who I am currently working for. 
I just took my 220 licensing class at SCC and passed it, I am awaiting to hear when I can sit for my state exam, now that I have been denied for my notary I am afraid that I am not going to be able to sit for my state exam. As I said I am NOT a convicted felon and do not understand why my application was denied. It says the governor denied me this is why I am writing to you. Also, because I don't want this to affect my state exam.
The notary batch ID is 42723, the trans ID is 1143659.
If I am a felon in the eyes of the state, even though I wasn't convicted, I was told otherwise and am a registered voter, which I just received a month ago, how can this be?
Please help, I know you are busy, but I would greatly appreciate it.

Mr. Bush
                 I sent you two E-mails on how to fix the problem with theHome Owners  Insurance in Fl. I see in the news paper you are more concern with the business problem of getting insurance. Look the problem with the State taking everything over will not fix the Insurance problem.
 
To fix the problem ( which I suggested in two E- Mails) will give the private sector reasons to sell insurance  in Fl. Let the Private Insurance companys  charge  people living in High Risk Areas   more a lot more like living on the water ( Water Front Property) .Also ,homes in  flood zones would be mandatory/required to have flood insurance. Set up an Seperate Insurance for sink holes  and also making it mandatory for all home owners on top of there Home Owners Insurance to purchase same . Then by seperating all three (3) the cost would come down for the Home Owners.  The Banks could make it mandatory/required when you purchase a home in Florida..
 
The governement should not be in the insurance business. Bring back the State Senators for a special season. Get this probelm done now this  
is a State Emergency that needs to be fixed now not in Nov/06. Pass the Laws, take the bull by the Horns and dont wait for you committee to come back with their finding. Be the Governor who fixed the Insurance Problem In Florida!!!!!!!!!.
 
I hope you MR Bush you  read this and the other two Emails I sent you.( PS )I know you are a home owner .However people dont have the money you have. 
 
If you are thinking of running for President of the United States you will need Florida to get elected.So fix the Insurance problem and the State is yours. People will see what you did in Fl and know you can help are country....As President!!!!

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

This high cost of insurance in the state of Florida and in Pasco and Hernando in particular, is causing an exodus of our residents.  Existing home sales have flooded the market and residents are unable to even sell.  Many, especially those on fixed income or with families to support, cannot effort the increase in insurance rates.  If they bought a new or resale house in the last year or two, they are also facing high property tax rates due to the high cost of real estate. Many people who will try and stay and somehow pay the high insurance increases will find ways to conserve their spending.  I am one of those people who saw my insurance premiums for my 2300 sq. ft. house go from $2300 to $4500.  I must now cancel the company that sprays my law, cancel my pool service etc. and cut back on luxury items such as restaurants and entertainment.  This trickle down effect will have disastrous consequences for small business in Florida. 
I would encourage our state politicians especially Governor Bush to call a special session so that our state legislators can address this insurance crisis and the SOH issues now, rather than later. Many people who were considering making a move in 2006 are now waiting to see what happens with the Save Our homes issue.  
The continued growth our our local and state economy is very dependent upon the resolution of these two very serious issues.  Do not wait until the spring of 2007 session.  Act now.

Dear Sir, 
As a middle income American I walk among the general population.  My lifestyle is not an outlier on the bell curve of American life.  I'm what we in the health field call "the first line".  I see what is happening in Florida, USA because of illegal immigration.  I am going to tell you how illegal immigration is affecting my life.  

        DETERIORATION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 
                1.  Schools - cafeteria workers do not speak or understand English.  How are they going to know and follow the health and safety procedures of food preparation and sanitation if they do not bother to learn the language.  Look at the data the Environmental and Health Inspectors are collecting.  

                2.  Restaurants - tourism is the major business of Florida.  All we need is tourist getting sick ( look at Carnivale Cruises as an example on how this can impact the business) and  it will be hard to recover from bad word of mouth news. When Chicago (born and raised) is the #1 tourist destination, even though Chicago has 4 seasons, Florida cannot afford any more bad press.

        INCREASE IN CRIME 
                1.  Driving - they have no driver's license, no insurance.  If you don't understand the language how can you possibly understand the street signs.

                2.  Crime increase - nothing happens to illegals; as evidenced by the State Trooper (todays news) who pulled over a van load of Illegals and had to let them go because we have no government officials on any level with the balls to evict these people out of America.     

        DETERIORATION IN SERVICES 
                1.  It's illegal for busineses to hire illegal immigrants, but nothing is done.  Why is that if the law is being broken.

                2.  More and more small American businesses are going under because they cannot outbid companies hiring cheap illegal workers.  More of our workers are loosing their jobs to illegal immigration.

                3.  I see and hear more and more Americans complaining about shoddy work; from new construction to air condition service. 

                4.  Service industry (tourism) - they're ignorance to our language and customs has really decreased  our quality of service in Florida.

        DETERIORATION OF AMERICA 
                Illegal vaguely means against a law that society has deemed necessary for protection.  My American life is in dire need of protection.  

There is no incentive from government officials to correct a problem that is going to increasinly getting worse.  Why do we keep trying to appease illegals?  Why don't we fine businesses for hiring illegals?  There are 4 Walmarts I shop at.  I tell you like I've told my family; the next American revolution is going to start in Walmart.  Just like the slap that started WWI.  Some illegal who because they don't know our language or customs don't know  the etiquette of shopping is going to piss off some American who can't take it any longer.  There's going to be words exchanged.  The American is going to shout "You're in my f…..ing country.  Learn the language.  Take you’re a..back to your country"!  Shopping carts will crash!  More words exchanged!  A crowd gathers!  Patriotic emotions flair!  In a Walmart is where the civil revolution will take place.  That's the way I see it.  

You don't put a band aid on a festering wound.  On the other hand  surgery is not always the best choice.  We have laws against illegal immigration.  We don't need new laws.  Just enforce the ones we have, before our quality of Ameican life gets any lower.  Thank you

Sincerely, 
Toni Fisher

Hi Governor Bush,
 
My name is Cheryl L Cavender FKA Cheryl L LeCraw, I actually meet your Mother and secrete Service while I was staying at the Ponte Vedra Lodge and Club in Ponte Vedra Florida back 1999.  She wanted the room that I lived in while I was being seen at the Mayo Clinic, so I moved out for one evening to the Inn and returned when she no longer needed the room.  She had come in town to give a speech.
 
I have had some pretty amazing things happen to me over the past ten years and wanted to see if you and I could schedule a meeting or time or way to talk about these things.
 
I have a home in Atlanta but I am currently a Florida resident.  I really need some proper legal guidance and apparently have paid all the wrong parties.  I thought since you Governed the State of Florida, that hopefully you could give me some proper "positive" feedback or guidance to remedy my entire situation. 
 
You see, I came to Jacksonville because I had been having "debilitating symptoms" and the doctor's here in Atlanta could not figure out what was wrong.  Apparently, I chose your Mother's favorite room to live in while I went through the Mayo Clinic's rule out process.  Unfortunately, the rule out process exceeded five years and I went through a divorce.  I've basically paid numerous attorneys in Florida and Georgia to represent my best interest and feel as though my interest was never represented.  I've written many letters asking or seeking some proper remedies in my horrible situation, unfortunately with no success.
 
I was researching this web-page and saw I could contact you and I'm sure you receive many letters or emails from thousands upon thousands of people but, thought well I'll give it a try and see if you respond.  It's a very long story to tell and I'm not currently up for the task but thought I'd make the initial contact and hope.  You have always been in my prayers, and by this, I mean all people.
 
Again, my name is Cheryl Lynn Cavender and I reside at 140 Vera Cruz Drive unit 622 Ponte Vedra Florida 30342 and also at 310 Fountain Oaks Lane, Atlanta Georgia 30342.  my email address is cherylcavender@yahoo.com
 
I hope to hear from you.

I am not your constituent, but I am so concerned about this issue that I
want to voice my opposition to efforts to "legalize" illegal aliens living
in this country.
This goes to one of our most basic tenets of American society ... "that we
are a nation of laws, not men".  A recent federal judge's decision not to
deport known illegals because of "what MIGHT happen to the law" is an
example of why we are in trouble.

Respectfully, I would request that you and your fellow politicians would
recognize the dangers of continuing this trend.  Add your voice to those
who:

Will fully implement "secure borders, first"
Do not want to wait for "comprehensive" immigration reform, which is code
for "do nothing effective"
Want to postpone ANY talk of "pathways" to citizenship for these illegals,
who MUST go back.
Reform current entrance policies to make them efficient AND effective.
Will punish employers who have employed illegals (Big companies in
particular)
Want to promote "English immersion" for new legal immigrants, rather than
ESL programs that have proven ineffective
REMOVE ANY GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING OF ADVOCACY / INTEREST GROUPS PROVIDING
SUPPORT TO THE ILLEGALS

Thank you for your review of this request.  Please interpret the capitalized
spellings as "special emphasis" rather than shouting.  This issue evokes
very strong emotion in all of us in my social circle.  If politicians do not
become statesmen on this issue, it will become even more divisive than it is
currently with consequences I cannot even contemplate.

Subject:	Support for the Appointment of Tara Pascotto Paluck for Lee County Judge

August 2, 2006

 

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor--State of Florida

 

RE: Support for the Appointment of Tara Pascotto Paluck for Lee County Judge

 

 

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

First, I trust this correspondence finds you, your family and your entire staff doing well. 

 

Second, and to get straight to the point for this correspondence, as you are aware you were recently given a short list of names from the Judicial Nominating Committee of the 20th Judicial Circuit for the purpose of selecting one nominee for the vacant position of County Judge for Lee County. Tara Pascotto Paluck was one of those chosen for the short list and this correspondence is in support of her appointment.

 

As you may recall we’ve met on several occasions both in Fort Myers and in Tallahassee as I’ve supported both you and President Bush as a member of the Republican Party at the Regents level. Knowing that you meet many people I’ve provided a brief overview of my background as reference to possibly spark your memory as well as providing meaning behind my support for Tara Pascotto Paluck.

 

In 1996, at the age of 26, I self funded a home based Internet business that ultimately became one of the largest performance marketing companies globally. Head quartered here in Florida, my company MIVA grew to represent 120,000 clients with offices throughout the United States and the European Union. I brought the company to the public market in 1999 and the company continues to trade on NASDAQ. Unlike most other Internet companies, we had tremendous growth through 2000, ’01, ’02, ’03, ’04 & ’05 growing 16,000% in a profitable manner. We were recognized repeatedly as one of the fastest growing companies in the US by entities such as Deloitte and Touche – E&Y (from a revenue and earning perspective) all while bringing many new high paying jobs to the market (several hundred in the US alone). I’ve received many awards over the years from local recognition awards to representing Florida nationally as one of Florida’s ‘Ernst and Young Entrepreneurs of the Year’. While I won at the regional level, unfortunately I did not win the national award - I believe I lost to the two founders of Google.

 

Through the years I established several other companies and made investments into yet other companies with an eye toward the future. Having stepped down as Chairman & CEO of MIVA this past April I now oversee those investments through my personal portfolio company Nexus Capital while maintaining a large share position within MIVA.

 

The point to this personal overview is throughout the past ten years I have become very aware of how local, state and national politics affected my opportunities as a business owner. Knowing that my voice could make a difference I became involved at the Regent level within the RNC as well as a Trustee within the Foundation of the Florida Chamber of Commerce. 

 

During this same period I became the father of 2 which has also influenced how I think about politics. This is the most significant point as it relates to the nomination of Lee County Judge as I firmly believe we need well rounded individuals with a proven track record of supporting the ideology you have brought to the governor’s office in every judge seat possible. By doing so we ensure that our children will not be subject to slanted interpretation of the law as they develop into productive members of our society. Fortunately the Southwest Florida area has been served well historically and with Tara Pascotto Paluck’s appointment I strongly believe that track record will continue. 

 

Tara’s back ground is diverse giving her experience in multiple areas rather than on one or two areas of expertise. This diversity gives me comfort in that I believe it would provide valuable experience regardless of the case/situation rather than having a person that has had extensive experience in limited areas which may produce volatile results. This diversity has also provided ample comfort in that there is a track record indicating how she views many different topics. 

 

In closing, I would like to thank you for your time on this matter and urge you to appoint Tara Pascotto Paluck as Lee County’s newest appointed Judge. I feel strongly that you will be satisfied with this decision as will your constituents in this area. Feel free to contact me if I can be of further assistance as you make your decision.

 

Best wishes to you, your family and your entire staff.

 

Regards,

 

Craig A. Pisaris-Henderson

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
I am writing on behalf of the Central Florida World War 2 Museum.  The Central Florida WW2 Museum is planned to be the next great tribute to those who fought to preserve freedom in World War II.  In order to achieve this mission, we would like to solicit your help.  
 
The museum was incorporated in Florida as a 501(c)(3) not for profit corporation in 2005.  Currently operating in an executive office in Tampa, Florida, our short-term plan is to move to a temporary location where we can house a portion of the museum collection, meet the public, and pursue development plans full-time.  The long-term plan is to purchase a site in Central Florida between Tampa, and Orlando within proximity to Interstate 4.  Once a site is purchased, a facility housing state of the art exhibits will be constructed to teach future generations about the sacrifices made by a past generation for their benefit.  Once complete, the museum will have a constant impact on Florida, the Nation and the world community. 
 
As a not for profit corporation, we are entrusted with donations from people who understand the need for this tribute and who believe we can deliver it.  It is our responsibility to create the best team possible in order to ensure success.  We would like to extend an invitation for you to join our Board of Directors.  As the son of a World War II veteran, I am sure you can understand the significance and importance of this project.  We will require the assistance of qualified and motivated individuals, such as yourself, in order to make this vision a reality.  We believe your service to the State of Florida makes you an ideal candidate for the Central Florida WW2 Museum Board of Directors.   
 
Governor Bush, I hope you will seriously consider this opportunity.  The G.I. Generation is fading into history.  It is our duty to make sure the world remembers their noble deeds.  
 
Please contact me via email at info@cfloridaww2museum.org or phone (813) 504-3826 with regards to this offer or questions concerning this organization.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

I recall not long ago, Gov Jeb Bush trumpeting the economy of Florida as being the envy of the nation.  And I agreed with his Assessment.  However our current Insurance problem is looking to decimate our fine State.  Those who are going to be affected the hardest, are the ones who are already having a hard enough time getting by, let alone getting ahead.  No longer do I have to only pre-qualify prospects for Financing when purchasing a home, but I also have to break the news of the Insurance rates they will likely be paying, and all too often it ends up killing the deal.  I believe our state is in grave jeopardy and the situation must be addressed ASAP.  I implore you to immediately call for an Emergency Session to deal with this potentially catastrophic situation, before Florida goes from being the Sunshine State to the Doom & Gloom State.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Governor Bush:

On or about January 11, 2002, a member of my companion's family was 
convicted in Circuit Court, Seventh Judicial Circuit, Volusia County, 
Division 07, upon a plea of guilty, to a charge of "Dealing in Stolen 
Property."  He was placed on probation for a period of 18 months.

Although I do not yet know with certainty whether he complied with all his 
obligations during his probation, I believe  that he did so comply.

Although I am an attorney admitted to practice law in New York and other 
jurisdictions, I am not admitted to practice in Florida.  (Some years ago 
a Florida Judge admitted me to practice pro hac vice, that is, for the 
purposes of one case.  I do not intend to seek to be admitted in Florida 
and I will not represent the individual in question.)

I wish to find out the name and the contact information for a person 
within your Administration who can supply to me information about the 
procedures the individual may follow to apply to you for clemency.

The young man is gainfully employed in New York City, but desires to seek 
new employment and is concerned that his conviction may destroy or damage 
his ability to seek a better position.

I will be most grateful to you if someone on your staff will point him in 
the proper direction.

Dear Gov. Bush, My name is Merri Bruggeman. I live in Lakeland, FL. I lost my son Jonmichael (only child) to a Personal Water Craft accident on 07-08-06 in Ft. Lauderdale. My loss has been devistating!! I need your help! I am determined to help the people of Florida to be come more aware of the safety on operating PWC'S. I pray no other parent has to go through such a loss as my own!  I have since joined the Coliation of Parents and Families for PWC.(info@pwcwatch.com). I have spoke with the Cofounder, Nita Boles and also have e-mailed Captain Richard Moore (Boating Law Administrator). I have received responses. I know how you care about the people in the State of Florida! I know I am still greiving deeply and yet have truly accepted what has really happened to my son. What I do know is with his strength and him by my side with so much love, I will be heard! 
 I have a question to ask. Have you ever taken a boater education course and if not,  would you be willing to take one? The state of Florida  is in dire need for boater education of PWC'S. The accidents and fatalities are numbering. My son now is one of those fatalities!!!   I would love to set up a meeting with you and the Coliation by my side to discuss this further. Please Gov. Bush, please let me be heard.       Thank you, Merri Bruggeman  (863-859-7808)

Subject:	Emergency Executive order for roof inspection and/or re-inspection

Rush!!  to
 
 
Dear: Governor Bush
 
The processing time for roof inspections and/re-inspections by County and City inspectors  is excessive and untimely. County and city Building Departments  in South Florida are over burden with request for roof inspection and re-inspections and now we have another pending Storm, Soon to be a Hurricane (Chris),  that appears to be headed for South Florida,  with the prospect of danger to life and property. I am writing to request that you act immediately to draft and implement an  Emergency Executive order instructing counties and cities in the path of any projected or pending Hurricane and/or storm to do the following.
 
1. Expedite  the processing time for any and all roof inspections and re-inspections.
 
2.Allow contractors to hire independent state certified  inspectors to perform roof inspection and/or re-inspection at this time.
 
3. Suspend all non-essential home inspections by cities and county's  allowing local inspectors to concentrate their efforts on those pending roof inspection and/or re-inspections. 
 
The above provision if implement may have a greater impact on saving  homes,  property and life's 
 
Thanking you in advance

Dear Governor Bush:

TO ALL THOSE WHO WILL LISTEN!!!

AS YOU ALREADY KNOW PASCO COUNTY IS EXPERIENCING SEVERE PROBLEMS RE OUR HUGE INCREASES IN HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE.  I HAVE BEEN IN  CONTACT WITH SOME OF OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO ASSURE ME THEY HAVE PASSED SOME LEGISLATION THAT MAY HELP THE SITUATION AFTER THE NEW YEAR.  I TOLD THEM I WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS BY THEN - AS WILL BE MANY OTHERS IN THE REAL ESTATE OR RELATED FIELDS.

MY HUSBAND AND I OWN A LOCAL REAL ESTATE COMPANY.  WHERE WE ARE SMALL IN NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES AND REALTORS, WE ARE ALWAYS ONE OF THE TOP THREE PRODUCING AGENTS IN THE WEST PASCO BOARD OF REALTORS.  OUR BUSINESS HAS COME TO A SCREECHING HALT IN THE LAST MONTH.  WE WILL HAVE NO INCOME TO PAY OUR OVERHEAD OR PERSONAL BILLS COME THE END OF AUGUST.  WE HAVE NOT PUT UNDER CONTRACT ONE OF OUR LISTINGS SINCE JULY 7TH.  WE NORMALLY HAVE 8-10 PER MONTH.  

WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING A NORMAL SLOW DOWN AS ALL THE NATIONAL ECONOMISTS ARE SAYING, IT IS IF SOMEONE HAS TURNED OFF THE FAUCET!  

WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 10 EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS AT OUR OFFICE THAT DEPEND ON REAL ESTATE TO MAKE A LIVING.  I HAVE JUST LET GO MY TWO RECEPTIONISTS AND AM HOPING I DON'T  HAVE TO LET MY PERSONAL ASSISTANT GO - THAT WOULD MEAN I WOULD RUN THE OFFICE MYSELF. 

MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN SELF EMPLOYED MOST OF OUR WORKING LIFE AND ARE USED TO THE UPS AND DOWNS.  WE ARE USED TO SPENDING MONEY TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN, BUT WITH THIS SITUATION WE FEEL COMPLETELY HELPLESS.  THEIR IS NOTHING WE CAN PERSONALLY DO TO CHANGE WHAT IS FUELING THIS CRISIS, ASIDE FROM CUTTING EXPENSES TO THE BONE, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY DONE.  

I GUESS OUR NEXT DECISION WILL BE HOW LONG WE USE OUR SAVINGS TO PAY BILLS AND RUN OUR BUSINESS - THIS IS WHERE OUR STATE GOVERNMENT MUST STEP IN AND HELP.  SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO CUT THE HIGH INSURANCE BILLS OUR COUNTY IS EXPERIENCING OR WE WILL BE FACING THE DECISION TO MOVE OUT OF STATE, LIKE MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE DECIDED TO DO.  ALTHOUGH THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR HOUSE TO MOVE!!!

WE LOVE THE FLORIDA LIFESTYLE AND DO NOT WANT TO UPROOT OUR FAMILY BUT IF THIS DIRE SITUATION DOES NOT END SOON WE WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE OUR THREE YOUNG CHILDREN SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THINGS ARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING A LIVING IN REAL ESTATE IS VIABLE.

PLEASE HELP US!!!

Sir, 

     I would like to have an appointment set to have a phone conference with you in reference to anonymous complaints sent to your office in reference to me as a Law Enforcement Officer in Lee County, Florida.  These complaints came from my ex-husband and his current wife and were sent in a malicious manner, to defame me.  My career as a law enforcement officer is over, due to the media frenzy and the political position of the Sheriff of Lee County.  Please hear me out, I am only asking for a moment of your time to assist me in rectifying these allegations.

Dear Governor Bush:

I recall not long ago, Gov Jeb Bush trumpeting the economy of Florida as being the envy of the nation.  And I agreed with his Assessment.  However our current Insurance problem is looking to decimate our fine State.  Those who are going to be affected the hardest, are the ones who are already having a hard enough time getting by, let alone getting ahead.  No longer do I have to only pre-qualify prospects for Financing when purchasing a home, but I also have to break the news of the Insurance rates they will likely be paying, and all too often it ends up killing the deal.  I believe our state is in grave jeopardy and the situation must be addressed ASAP.  I implore you to immediately call for an Emergency Session to deal with this potentially catastrophic situation, before Florida goes
from being the Sunshine State to the Doom & Gloom State.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
It is my understanding that Tara Pascotto Paluck has been selected as a possible candidate for the appointed position of County Court Judge in the Twentieth Judicial Circuit.  I have been a long time friend and colleague of Tara.  I have known Tara for close to thirty years. In that time she has never done anything that would ever call her reputation into question.  She is an amazing person.  I have had the opportunity to work with Tara professionally.  She is the walking example of what other attorneys in our profession should strive to become.  She is honest, sincere, ethical and a zealous advocate for her clients rights.  She has worked hard to rise to the top of her profession.  As a result of her many years of hard work she has earned a reputation as excellent attorney.
 
Tara and I worked together at the State Attorney's Office prosecuting cases.  Tara always managed to let the law and her conscience be her guide.  After leaving the State Attorney's Office she went to work in civil litigation.  She has many years of both civil and criminal legal experience.  She has the ability to be fair and impartial despite the issue(s). It is this combination of experience and personal stability that would make her perfect to serve on the  County Court bench. 
 
Tara is also a devoted mother to her two boys and her husband, Ron.  She manages to balance the everyday challenges of being both in a high stress career and a mother/wife.  It takes a special kind of person to be able to multi-task as well as Tara can do so. 
 
If Tara is selected to serve as a Judge on the County Court Judiciary she would do a great job for both the citizens of Lee County and the State of Florida. 
 
If I can provide you any additional information please do not hesitate to contact me at the address or phone numbers below.

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush,
 
I have been employed with the Public Defender's Office for 6 1/2 years.  During this time, I have had the pleasure of working with Tamara Gray both professionally and personnally.  She is an excellent attorney who works hard to advocate for our clients.  She is fair and fights for fair results.  Because of her clear communication and dedication, she has a many clients who keep in contact with her to let her know how well they are doing.
 
Tamara puts her hands to the plow when it comes to community activities.  She has volunteered annually to walk for breast cancer research and cure.  I can recall her volunteering as a big sister on several occassions with students in the Miami Dade County Public School System.  Whenever a good cause is presented to her, she is more than willing to assist.   She is an excellent mother and role model for all young women.  
 
I highly recommend Tamara Gray for judge.  She will be a dedicated, hard working and impartial leader for our judicial system.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
 
Sincerely,
 
Ruenette White Bryan

Good Morning Governor Bush;
 
I am a member of the Greater A. O. H. Church of God in Ocala, Florida.  The reason for this message is to invite you to a special event we will be having on Saturday, September 16, 2006.  The event will be from 9:00 am -- 7:00 pm.  It is our desire to have different political figures here on that day to talk with the voters and do some campaigning.
 
The purpose of the "Old Fashioned Feast Day" is to raise the funds needed to complete a new addition to our facility.  This facility will include a larger dining room {where we feed less fortunate individuals 2 hot meals Monday -- Friday and dinner on Saturday}, tutoring, a community library, and a Christian School.  We do not receive government funding for our services, we have fundraisers during the year and receive donations from individuals from the church and community.
 
There will be fun and activities for everyone.  We will have performances from area churches and organizations.  There will be BBQ ribs, chicken, fried "fresh" fish, collard greens, macaroni n' cheese, sweet potato pie, iced tea, and much more.

Dear Governor Bush:

We must ask the Governor to call a special session in regards to homeowners insurance. Florida is loosing ground daily in our economy.  We are having people relocate out of our state due to the high costs of insurance for homes and businesses.
We can not wait until next year to resolve this issue.  We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately. If we don't address this problem now, it will be more costlier and harder to resolve next year.  Please consider the loss in revenue the state will realize from doc stamps on mortgages and on the deed transfer.  If sales are down, so is revenue in these areas and many others.  Can the state afford this loss of revenue?
Please call a special session now to get working on this situation.  To delay is costly to everyone.

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

Please get into special session and do something about this homeowners insurance crisis. It has crippled my business, sent many of my coworkers in real estate and mortgage lending out of business, and brought me real concern about my neighbors. As a Realtor, I have had many deals go by the wayside because buyers cannot afford the cost of insurance, which adds hundreds of dollars to their monthly mortgage bill. Moreover, I see many senior citizens dropping insurance entirely on their paid-for homes. If we should have a storm in these circumstances, I don't know what we will do. I've seen this crisis rob my neighbors of their sense of security in a way not even the tragedy of 9-11 did. They are assuming huge risk they would not otherwise for their own homes, against what they believe, because they have been forced to it. Please find a remedy now. It is a terrible burden for so many.

The insurance disaster in Florida is ruining everything that I have worked for in the past 20 years.

Floridians are demanding that the insurance industry be regulated.

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

Help! Florida's economy is falling apart!  The reasons people made Florida their home are being lost quickly. Home insurance is a major issue and we need to have something done immediately. Many people are now relocating out of our state due to the high costs of insurance for homes and businesses or if they no longer have a mortgage they are not insuring their homes because the price is beyond their reach.

We can not wait until next year to resolve this issue.  We must have a special session called now so we can address the issue and come up with solutions immediately.

One of my suggestions would be to allow only insurance companies that are willing to offer home owners insurance to sell any kind of insurance in Florida. 

I still don't understand how after so many years of paying for insurance to guard against emergencies such as hurricanes and sink holes the insurance companies can claim they do not have enough money to cover what they have been taking money to do for years. 

If we don't address this problem now, it will be harder to resolve next year.  Please consider the loss in revenue the state will realize from doc stamps on mortgages and on the deed transfer.  If sales are down, which they are, so will revenue in these areas and many others.  Can the state afford this loss of revenue? How many realtors, mortgage companies and builders will leave the state for lack of revenue?

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

We need help now. Being a Realtor and doing business right here in Pasco County, FL for 16 years I have seen some big changes in the last 10 months. Homeowners and businesses are leaving our state in droves. Most all of our company listings are of homeowners being pushed out of their homes right out to another state other than Florida. Our current sales market has dwindled to a fast stop. No one can qualify for the homeowners insurance and property taxes on top of a mortgage payment. Since everyone is trying to leave and prospective home buyers can't qualify for the insurance and taxes; we are left with pending foreclosures. According to Realty Trac we currently have 4100 pre-foreclosure homes in West Pasco county! The West side of 19 in Pasco county will soon be a ghost town. We went from 800 homes on the market in October of 2005 to over 5400 homes currently for sale in West Pasco county. 

We cannot wait until next year to resolve this issue. We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately. If this is put off it will only cost all of us more in the long run. Real estate is the heartbeat of every community. If this isn't addressed quickly there will be a huge rippling effect. Larger than what we have already witnessed.

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

We have a major problem in our area and it is starting to spread over all of Florida. We have people relocating from our area and state, because of the lack of affordable homeowners insurance.  This is affecting the sales of homes and condo's and also now the rental market.  It is pricing the properties out of reach.  If a Insurance company offers affordable homeowners insurance in other states, but in our state they don't even offer it, but do offer auto, life, health, then they should offer homeowners or get out of the state all together.  Why do they get to pick and choose.  A lot of our problems were caused by the insurance companies taking the easy way out on claims, now they have caused the mess that they wish the everyday working person to pay for.  This needs to stop and stop now. 
Florida could become a state with no people living here, and I was born in this state and would not like to live anywhere else, but I need to make a living.  You can not sell houses with out insurance.  It is an election year, we can clean house if need be.

The working class people who work a minimum of 40 to 80 hours a week are able to afford a home? Business owners are looking else where to run there business as they can no longer afford to keep insurance on the business. I think it is past time for people to resolve the issue. We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

            Now that the interviews have been concluded for this position and you will be making your decision, I wish to recommend John Galuzzo for this position.  I am a prosecutor in Seminole County and have known John for over 15 years.  I had the privilege of interviewing with your staff for the county court position for which you appointed Jerry Collins in December of last year.  While I interviewed with the committee for this position I did not make the short list.  While I was disappointed, I was very happy that John’s was one of the names submitted.

 

While John is an excellent attorney, I don’t believe this is what makes him the best candidate for this position.  What does make John an excellent choice is his integrity and demeanor.  John is a rare thing; he is a truly honest man.  While he advocates for his clients, he doesn’t twist the facts or play games with the law.  John is a family man and extremely active in the community.  Judge Collins has shown herself to be an excellent judge; John Galuzzo is the same type of candidate.  Passionate about what he does, honest, diligent and intelligent.  He is the best candidate for the position.

Subject:	RE: Restoration Of Civil Rights Backlog

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am asking for your assistance, since you are my Governor, in finding out why the Florida Parole Commission has not granted (nor denied) my "automatic" application for restoration of civil rights. See, FLORIDA CAUCUS OF BLACK STATE LEGESLATORS, INC. V. CROSBY, 877 So.2d 861 (Fla. 1st DCA 2004), as they are failing to assist. My application has been in their office for YEARS. Here is my last email I sent them: 
 
I have been trying to get my rights restored for YEARS now. I even got emails saying they have received my numerous applications. Lastly, NINE MONTHS AGO on November 2, 2005, Janet H. Keels sent me a letter advising me that my application has been received in this office for processing.
 
I have been a certified volunteer chaplain for the Department of Corrections for a few years now and I would like to get the right to vote and to be eligible for jury duty. I have even held a Real Estate Licensure from the DBPR since 2000.
 
The initiative of Governor Bush was not intended for this to take this long. I thought it was to expedite the process.
 
If I don't hear something in the next 30 days, I will have no other recourse but to find relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. (1st Circuit)
 
Please help me. I have waited patiently a LONG, LONG time.
 
Respectfully,

Good Day Sir,

 

Since 9/11, Air Defense Artillery units from South Carolina, New Mexico, Florida and Mississippi have been vigilant in their mission to protect the National Capital Region and—on order— other high-value assets within the United States from air attacks.

These units are unquestionably performing the most important peacetime mission ever assigned to the National Guard. We do not know of any other job being done at the present time, which is more important to the safety and well being of our nation. It’s a job, which must be done perfectly every minute of the day and night, and every day of the year. Any failure here regardless of how slight could mean disaster.

The command and control missions are currently performed by the Guard-manned Task Force Osprey at the Joint Air Defense Operations Center, located within the National Capital Region. Commanded by Colonel Frank Laudano of the 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, Florida Army National Guard, Task Force Osprey is breaking new ground on how Army air and missile defense operates within the United States.

If you ever have a time, we would be honored for you to come visit your FL National Guard troops currently mobilized, Operation Noble Eagle, at the Nation’s Capital. For further information please feel free to contact 1LT Hall or SGT Cortez @ 202-767-1055. Thank you for your time.

Subject:	A++ plan -- living example that it works

Dear Governor Bush:
 
My name is Pam Oakes and I am a living example that the A++ program works.
 
As a sixth grader (1976) at Caloosa Middle School (Cape Coral, Fla.), I volunteered to be a school newspaper reporter. I loved it! In eighth grade, I was promoted to editor. (Meanwhile, I was enrolled in all the advance courses and participated in regional and state science fairs.) 
 
As a high school student, I worked in the editorial department of the Cape Coral Daily Breeze (1982-1983). I typeset community news copy and did an occasional article for the evening paper. (Meanwhile, I was an advanced high school student and represented Florida as a finalist and U.S. Air Force second place winner in the International Science and Engineering Fair -- 1982 and 1983.)
 
I attended college and moved around to the Daily Breeze sister papers (to accommodate my collegiate and post educational schedule 1984-86, 1987-1989). I became the editor of a monthly, speciality publication (Senior News, 1990) and moved back to daily papers the next year (Charlotte Sun Herald, Englewood Sun Herald, Punta Gorda Herald,1991-1993). I excelled in the media, receiving four Florida Press Association awards between 1988 through 1993. I loved being a newspaper reporter/editor, but I knew that there was something more that I enjoyed -- cars. 
 
I grew up in an automotive family on the east side of Detroit. My great-grandfather, grandfather and father were technicians and I continued the tradition becoming the fourth generation mechanic. I left the newspaper industry to work with my father, Jerry Oakes, November 1993.
 
I worked for an independent shop approximately a year and a half. I knew that I could do better. So, I started my own shop, Pam's Motor City Automotive (Fort Myers, Fla.) in 1995. There was one technician -- me. I was the service writer, the advertising director and bookkeeper, as well. Today, I have 15 technicians/support personnel running the multi-million dollar auto repair and tire sales shop. 
 
I still turn wrenches.
 
Yes, I am an example that early exposure influences. Let our future generations experience the same type of "hands-on" learning that taught me work ethics, gave me the ability to do something I love and contribute to society.

Hi there!  We live here in Tallahassee, and my children would really like to meet Gov. Bush - even just briefly for a moment to shake hands and snap a quick picture.  We have tried several times to drop by his office (without attempting to arrange anything in advance), but we always miss him.  Either he is out of town, or simply out of his office and we keep missing him.  Is there any way to know when he might be there, or does he sometimes have open times when he will meet people from the general public?  Both of my kids appreciate Gov. Bush's interest in their education, and they both "voted" for him in the last kids' election.  I think it would be wonderful for them to have a chance to shake his hand and say "thank you" to him personally.
 
Please let me know if there might be a way to work this out.  Thank you so much!  :-)

Dear Governor Bush:

I am probably one of the few local realtors that have not obtained a second job yet to try to support my failing business.
The insurance disaster in Florida is ruining everything that I have worked for in the past 20 years. In just 6 months the real estate industry, one of the largest industries in Florida, has been destroyed. Something must be done. 
Floridians are demanding that the insurance industry be regulated. 
Please call a special session to investigate the activities of the insurance industry NOW!!! I will be out of business by next year along with most other small business owners in Florida! It's pretty ironic that the hurricanes and sinkholes aren't ruining us. Our own state is!

Dear Governor Bush:

Please get into special session and do something about this homeowners insurance crisis. It has crippled my business, sent many of my coworkers in real estate and mortgage lending out of business, and brought me real concern about my neighbors. As a Realtor, I have had many deals go by the wayside because buyers cannot afford the cost of insurance, which adds hundreds of dollars to their monthly mortgage bill. Moreover, I see many senior citizens dropping insurance entirely on their paid-for homes. If we should have a storm in these circumstances, I don't know what we will do. I've seen this crisis rob my neighbors of their sense of security in a way not even the tragedy of 9-11 did. They are assuming huge risk they would not otherwise for their own homes, against what they believe,
because they have been forced to it. Please find a remedy now. It is a terrible burden for so many.

Subject:	Home owners insurance

Dear Governor Bush:

Although I copied this letter I strongly agree with it's content.

Florida is losing ground daily in our economy.  We are having people relocate out of our state due to the high costs of insurance for their homes and businesses.



We can not wait until next year to resolve this issue.  We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately.



If we don't address this problem now, it will more cost more and be harder to resolve next year.  Please consider the loss in revenue the state will realize from doc stamps on mortgages and on the deed transfer.  If sales are down, so will revenue be effected in these areas and many others.  Can the state afford this loss of revenue?



Please call a special session now to get working on this situation.  To delay is costly to everyone.

Sincerely,

To Who Ever is reading my e-mails, Once again I am trying to contact my governor Jeb Bush. I was told not once but twice that if I e-mail him I could speak with him I do not want his secretary or assistants I want to speak with my governor his self. I was contacted by Mr. Ron Loyd he told me that there was nothing he could do to help me because he is not over the child care association he was just replying to me to let me know that therefore pretty much he did his job. Believe me I am not going to go away until I speak with him I need help and so far I am not getting it. You know were is all my tax dollars right along with every working American out here going. All the money that's is used to help other country's  out with and there families could help me our government is so quick to help with non Americans what about us , how would the governor feel if he only brought home less than $200 a week to raise 3 children on plus pay bills plus have to buy gas to get back and forth with, on top of that your daily needs like toilet paper and soap and shampoo to bath with,soap to wash your dishes and clothes with, but he cant get daycare assistance so he can work to keep providing for his family as a single parent. It is not a fun game to play having to worry from day to day if I can afford to pay for a day care expense of $110.00 a week for just one child and pay someone to watch my other 2 children so I can work ,or if I am going to make my rent every week so I am not living on the streets with me and my 3 daughters because I cant get help from my own government let alone my own country with child care assistance. The only thing I know to do next is go live with the news and let them know I cant get help, no one will let me talk with my governor,or just go to his next live interview and ask him in front of all of America and see what his response is there maybe that is the only way I can see him in person and speak to him. or just drive to Tallahassee and sit in the lobby till he agrees to see me. I don't know what to do or how to go about it but I will keep raising my voice until it is heard and helped,because I know Jeb Bush is not reading this himself he has people to do it for him,maybe he should take time himself to read this and see I am for real I am not going know where until he helps me. Thank You and have a nice day Deanna Leamon 3213731003  1927 Radnor Dr Melbourne Florida 32901

              St Petersburg, Fl. 33709
              
To:         Governor Jeb Bush
 
 
 
Hello Governor Bush.  This is Hector Millan.  Sir I wanted to ask you a question regarding a recent study I was doing online regarding Prop. 215 in California and its Medical Marijuana Laws.  Sir, I was wondering, "Why hasn't Florida adapted to Prop. 215 as California has.  Below I sent you a copy of Prop. 215 from California's state laws:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Text of California’s Proposition 215 
(CA Health & Safety Code 11362.5) 
The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 
California’s ‘Medical Marijuana’ Law 
This initiative measure is submitted to the people in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Section 8 of the Constitution. 
This initiative measure adds a section to the Health and Safety Code; therefore, new provisions proposed to be added are printed in italic type to indicate that they are new. 
===================== 
THE LAW!:
--------------- 
SECTION 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, reads: 
11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. (b)(1) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows: (A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the use of marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. 
 
(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction. (C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana. (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for non-medical purposes. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes. (d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section 11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician. (e) For the purposes of this section, ''primary caregiver" means the individual designated by the person exempted under this section who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that person. 
SEC. 2. If any provision of this measure or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the measure that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this measure are severable. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Sir, what I want to know is, "Why hasn't Florida adapted to Prop. 215?" According to http://www.doh.state.fl.us/disease_ctrl/aids/updates/facts/usfl.html 
Florida is third behind New York, and California with more than 75,000 AIDS cases that have been reported and this is before the year 2000!
 
In California patients who are eligible to get a Medical Marijuana Prescription are required to carry a Prop. 215 Medical Marijuana Identification Card in order for the Doctors to know that they are eligible to get a prescription.  In this website http://www.rivcommic.org/downloads/DHS_9042_Application-Renewal_Form.pdf from Riverside County they have an application for the Patients Medical Marijuana Application/Renewal Program sponsored by the State of California Health and Human Services Agency and the Dept. Of Health Services.  I believe if Florida does the same and starts an application process for the patients with cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief that it would do the State of Florida better.  
 
This would benefit our state by dropping a crime rate.  It would lead to fewer arrests if they have it prescribed, fewer people growing it and selling it as well.  Our jail here in Pinellas county is already overpopulated.  It would benefit everyone if people adapted to California's State Prop. 215.
 
Sir, basically I just wanted to know, "What's the difference in us being in Florida and not being able to get the prescription as to California?"
 


Thank You,
Hector E. Millan

Subject:	Cristina Miranda

Dear Governor Bush,

 

It is with great pride that I recommend Cristina Miranda for a seat on the Miami-Dade County Court bench.  I have known Cristina since 1995, when she was a law clerk for the Honorable Michael Chavies.  Upon her joining the State Attorney’s Office in 1997, she quickly distinguished herself as both fearless and competent.  She tackled difficult cases ambitiously, and prepared them meticulously.  Consequently, in 2001, I was honored to welcome Cristina to the Gang Prosecution Unit I had co-founded four years earlier.  To my knowledge, Cristina was the first female gang prosecutor in Florida.

 

Most of my eight years at the State Attorney’s Office were spent developing gang prosecution in Florida.  Since resigning in 2002, I have continued to maintain a close relationship with the Office, with the Gang Prosecution Unit, and with Cristina.  I consider Cristina my protégé and will tell you she was unmatched in her ability to grasp the concept and complexity of hardcore gang prosecution.  

 

In her nine years as a member of the Bar, Cristina has personified honor and integrity; and she has more maturity, professionalism and experience than many attorneys who have been practicing for two and three times as long.  I strongly encourage you to spend time getting to know Cristina, and I strongly recommend her appointment to the Miami-Dade County Court.

 

Should you have any questions, I can be reached at (305) 986-1363.

 

Regards,

 

Jarrett Wolf

Subject:	[*] Felon Questions

Governor Bush,
 
Three and a half years ago I was convicted of a felony in New York. I decided New York was not a good place for me to be; so I made a request for my probabtion to be moved to Florida in 1/2005 so I could have a new start. I have completed all required programs but, I am still on probation. My main concern isn't probation. I have been at my current job for over a year. This mistake I made when I was 17 is holding me back from getting a good job/career. I want to know if there is a way for to get some kind of pardon or a letter from the courts that I can attach to job applications? Or a program i can attend to help me? If there is any advice you can give me I'd appreciate it.
 
Thanks for your time,
 
Viola Highsmith

RE: HAROLD S. ESKIN’S NOMINATION FOR COUNTY JUDGE

 

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

It is with great pleasure that I have the opportunity to write on behalf of Harold S. Eskin who has been selected by the 20th Judicial Circuit Judicial Nomination Committee to fill the recently vacated Lee County Judgeship.

 

I am a retired federal employee, having spent nearly 30 years in public service with the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development, mostly as a manager at it’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.  As such, I was fortunate enough to work for President Bush’s administration.  

 

I moved to Florida in August of 2004 and now operate a consulting company specializing in the development and preservation of affordable housing for families and seniors.  

 

I serve on the Board of Directors of the Rotary Club of Cape Coral Gold Coast (Mr. Eskin is a Past President and member); the Board of Directors of Gulf Coast Village, a non-profit Continuum of Care Retirement Center in Cape Coral (Mr. Eskin is a Past President and current Board member and Counsel).  I also am the Public Relations Chair for the Florida Federation of Chapters (statewide) and the Cape Coral Chapter 1002 of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE).

 

I have known Mr. Eskin since I moved to Florida.  Professionally I have found Mr. Eskin to be knowledgeable of the law and able to listen to people, evaluate facts and circumstances, and focus on fair and legally correct outcomes.   He is on par with the lawyers that work with and for the highest level of the government in Washington D.C. I have worked with for many years. 

 

Personally, I also have observed Mr. Eskin in various circumstances and found that his is courteous and helpful, always mindful of the needs of others, always willing to lend a helping hand.  

 

For the foregoing reasons, I enthusiastically support Mr. Eskin’s selection for the bench. 

 

Respectfully submitted, 

 

Marc A. Harris

Dear Gov. Bush:

It is an honor and pleasure to send you this letter of recommendation for Michael Gotschall.  I have known Mike as a friend, neighbor and legal counsel for eight years.  During this time I have seen Mike in various roles, from devoted husband and father to active member in his community.  My son and Mike's sons are close friends.
 
Within the past 30 days, Mike offered me legal counsel regarding an incident at work involving age and gender discrimination.  Mike met with me for three hours on Saturday morning over the 4Th of July weekend and would not accept any payment and refused to charge me for his time and professional consultation. Thanks to Mike's help, this issue has been addressed and is now back on the right track. Mike's ability to listen and his insightful demeanor has again proven to be beneficial to the best interest of me and my family.
 
As a Hispanic businesswomen in Central Florida, I am an active member of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Orlando.  In late 2005, I was honored with a nomination, and was a finalist for, the Hispanic Chamber Don Quixote Award for "Professional of the Year."   As a mother, businesswoman, and a proud Hispanic in Central Florida I am honored to recommend Mike for Seminole County Judge.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Sir:  I am writing to you in response to developing an insurance task force to look at the insurance crisis in Florida.  I have 49 years of experience in the insurance industry, including property/casualty, underwriting, reinsurance, and assisting others to decrease their risk exposure.  Also, as a homeowner, I have major concerns.  As of November 2006, my insurance company has declared my policy to be nonrenewable.  Their statement of reason for this was "to reduce our exposure to hurricane claims."
 
I feel I would be an asset to your task force.  Please feel free to contact me at any time at (941) 792-5246 or at my email address of jspyker2@aol.com.  I look forward to collaborating with you on this very important issue affecting every citizen in Florida.

Hello Mr. Governor:
 
We met some time ago in 1994 as you ran for Governor the first time.
I was hosting a talk radio show in West Palm Beach and you came to
be interviewed.
 
Needless to say, except for  you chastizing me for not marrying my girlfriend
we go on just fine.
 
 
Today I am in a contentious primary for the GOP nomination for COUNTY COMMISSIONER in district 6. Of the 5 candidates I am the only one who
has been active in the party, fighting for candidates, issues and GOP
philosophy. I am a twice-elected committee man in  our  party's executive committee. 
My daily radio show is all about Republican support and values. I am known throughout Palm Beach County as a stalwart firebrand for Republican issues.
 
On the front page of the Orlando Sentinel and Miami  Herald 11/13/00 I am seen
litterally on the frontlines confronting the democrats. Fighting to keep them from stealing a presidential election from George W. Bush.
 
 
I am writing to you at this time to ask you to consider me for appointment to the 
Palm Beach County Commission in the event Anthony Masolotti resigns, is taken out of office  or is indicted for criminal acts by the current federal investigation now looking into his dealings.
 
Word here is is that his numerous absences from county business has caused a flurry of concern by other commissioners to have him removed from office. One has publicly called for his resignation. County business is oft times stalled or delayed by Masolotti's failure to act. He is currently the board's chairman and as such his lack of involvement
has caused county business to  falter.
 
 
So , Mr. Govorner, I ask that you take into consideration in the event of this
vacancy, my appointment to the board. As the strongest and most visible of the 
five candidates I would have the best chance of keeping this "always been" republican
seat on 11/07/06.  I also must relate to you that The Florida Fraternal Order of Police
and the Voter Coalition of Palm Beach County have ENDORSED my candidacy for County Commission.
 
 
Respectfully,

Gov, Bush;
 
I am a resident here in Jax, going on 3 years and love it here. I would like to make a suggestion, and I think as the Governor you would be the right person for the job, not to mention it would look good politically. My suggestion is to get popular sports and music and movie people to come into our schools to talk to the kids to inspire them to do the right thing. Kids really look up to these people and if they say something it is like gold to them, and in their enthusiasm they could bring home and share with their parents and siblings. I know as a joe normal person I would not be able to reach these popular people, but as governor, you would have the contacts and it would also be a very positivefor you to make an appearance, to show the importance of seeing something positive come out of such a bad thing. These babies death's need to stop. I personally believe we need to pray for help and we need to do something, because this is seriously sad. I hope and pray you can do something to help.
Thank you for reading and doing something positive for our State,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
        The article, below, gives you specifics about the egregious, illegal and dishonest actions of the Polk County State Attorney. He needs to be suspended, immediately , while criminal charges are prepared against him. We have no protection, in Pock County, Against dishonest public officials. Please to Charlie Crist are routinely ignored.
Our only hope is your intervention and public statements. There is virtually nothing as dangerous to the people of Polk County, than a prosecuting attorney with the ethical indecency of Robert Earl.
 
        In an interview with Florida Talks Radio owner Lynn Briedenbach, on FRIDAY AFTERNOON, Polk County State Attorney Jerry Hill, proclaimed that NO Criminal Charges were filed, No action taken and no one arrested in this case. Checks with the Court System showed no arrest and no charges filed. Jerry Hill sealed the complaint (which is illegal) lied to the press and the Polk Republican Chairman who spoke to Jerry at length about it and withheld the documents from the courthouse.
 
        I am preaching in a few hours and will be talking about dishonesty in government and this case specifically and asking people to contact your office and demand the protection of the Governor against defiling, dishonest, deceitful, public officials , such as Jerry Hill.
 
        Thank you for your interest.
 
Erin Abercrombie Surrenders

By Dana Willhoit
The Ledger





Erin and James Abercrombie 

LAKELAND -- Erin Abercrombie turned herself in Thursday night on a warrant stemming from a secret videotape she and her husband made, and she posted bail six hours later.

Her husband, James Abercrombie, who is out of town with their teenage daughter, will meet Erin in Bartow today so he can turn himself in and she can pick up their daughter, she said.

A warrant for interception of a wire communication was filed after they secretly videotaped a meeting they had with Donnie Tyler, a builder, in their home. Tyler had planned to put 29 homes on 14.77 acres near the Abercrombies' property off Gibsonia-Galloway Road.

That property was the subject of a bitter four-year court battle that the Abercrombies waged to prevent another developer from putting 33 homes on it.

The Abercrombies eventually prevailed against the Planning Commission, which had voted to increase the density allowed on the land so the developer could build the homes.

Senior Court Judge E. Randolph Bentley ultimately struck down the Planning Commission's zoning decision. The Abercrombies were reimbursed $71,000 by the county for their legal expenses.

Friday night, Erin Abercrombie said that she and her husband had no idea that secretly videotaping Tyler was illegal. "We watched `60 Minutes,' we watched `Dateline,' they all do that," she said.

They dropped the tape off at the State Attorney's Office before they went to a Polk County Planning Commission meeting last month, Abercrombie said. "Would we have done that if we thought we were doing anything illegal?"

Originally, she said, they videotaped Tyler "so we could see what he meant and what he wanted" when he was talking about this new planned development.

According to the Abercrombies, the tape shows Tyler claiming that the new development had the blessing of Merle Bishop, Polk's growth management director.

Bishop has denied telling Tyler that the development had his blessing.

The Planning Commission voted 3-2 last month to deny Tyler's proposed development.

Abercrombie said that the six hours she spent in jail Thursday night were the worst in her life. "It's dirty, it's stinky, it's cold, it's awful."

She and her husband are still $400,000 in debt because of their lawsuit against the county and can't afford a lawyer to fight these charges, she said. On Monday, they may try to find a lawyer who will represent them pro bono.

It absolutely infuriates me that HE is expected to be able to communicate with Spanish speaking students in his classroom.  Then, if he fails the student (who can speak NO English and therefore can't communicate or participate in classroom activities) then HE has to justify his actions and document pages,  upon pages of information.  This creates SO much extra work for an already UNDERPAID professional.  
 
We, as Americans, could learn ALOT from Australia.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  You really should make sure that George sees this too!!  I feel certain that your father would agree with everything that is stated below.

THREE CHEERS FOR AUSTRALIA 

I wish the leaders of our country would take a stand like Australia ...


Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia, as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks. 

A day after a group of mainstream Muslim leaders pledged loyalty to Australia at a special meeting with Prime Minister John Howard, he and his ministers made it clear that extremists would face a crackdown. 

Treasurer Peter Costello, seen as heir apparent to Howard, hinted that some radical clerics could be asked to leave the country if they did not accept that Australia was a secular state and its laws were made by parliament. 

"If those are not your values, if you want a country which has Sharia law or a theocratic state, then Australia is not for you," he said on national television. 

"I'd be saying to clerics who are teaching that there are two laws governing people in Australia, one the Australian law and another the Islamic law, that is false. If you can't agree with parliamentary law, independent courts, democracy, and would prefer Sharia law and have the opportunity to go to another country, which practices it, perhaps, then, that's a better option," Costello said. 

Asked whether he meant radical clerics would be forced to leave, he said those with dual citizenship could possibly be asked to move to the other country. 

Education Minister Brendan Nelson later told reporters that Muslims who did not want to accept local values should "clear off". 

"Basically, people who don't want to be Australians, and they don't want to live by Australian values and understand them, well then they can basically clear off," he said. Separately, Howard angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. 

AMERICA and Canada ..... ARE YOU LISTENING? 

Quote: 

IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It ! I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians 

However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others. I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to Australia . 

However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. 

This idea of Australia being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Australians, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. 

This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom. We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, then learn the language! 

Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push but a fact because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, Because God is part of our culture. 

We will accept your beliefs and will not question why, all we ask is that you accept ours and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us. 

If the Southern Cross offends you, or you don't like "A Fair Go", then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. 

We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. By all means keep your culture but do not force it on others. 

This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this, but once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, "THE RIGHT TO LEAVE." 

If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.

Far to often we have no information or little information then when our judges make unfair, unjust, unrighteous and plain bad decision we our disappointed with our judicial system and their political counterparts, that they did not give us the information needed about these judges to make the best decision on who we would elect and/or would agree to appoint.

GOVERNOR BUSH AWARDS RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUND GRANT TO THE CITY OF ARCADIA 

On Monday, I awarded a Rural Infrastructure Fund Grant totaling $30,000 to
the City of Acadia for a Feasibility Study to determine the beneficial
impact of reconstructing and expanding the former Arcadia Rodeo facility. 
Arcadia is within DeSoto County which I re-designated in 2006 as part of a
'Rural Area of Critical Economic Concern'.  The Arcadia Rodeo is the oldest
rodeo in Florida dating back to 1929 and known throughout the southeastern 
United States.  This feasibility grant will assist the City in determining
how best to rebuild and expand a new rodeo facility which will have multiple
uses.  I am truly pleased to support their initiative through our rural 
development grants. The benefits of this study will help the community
recover from the devastating impacts of the 2004 hurricane season.
Preservation of Arcadia All-Florida Championship Rodeo is an important
component of DeSoto County's long-term recovery plan, and grants are a
significant tool to help them meet their goals.


GOVERNOR BUSH AND LT. GOVERNOR JENNINGS JOIN FLORIDIANS IN SAVING MONEY
DURING THE 2006 SALES TAX HOLIDAY 

On Monday, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings and I joined back-to-school shoppers
at Target to buy books, clothing and school supplies during this year's
sales tax holiday.  School items purchased by and Lt. Governor Jennings 
myself will be provided to our mentees.
I encourage all Floridians to take advantage of this year's tax holiday on
school supplies, as we prepare for the upcoming school year.  I also
encourage Floridians to buy extra items and donate them to those less 
fortunate.  Businesses and shoppers with questions regarding the sales tax
holiday can contact the Department of Revenue toll-free taxpayer assistance
line at 1-800-352-3671 between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.  Information 
also is available through the Department of Revenue web site at
www.myflorida.com/dor or by visiting a Department of Revenue Service Center.


GOVERNOR JEB BUSH SIGNS HB 209 

On Thursday, I signed HB 209 eliminating the last part of Florida's
insidious Intangibles Tax.  I thank Senators Jeff Atwater and Charlie Clary
and Representative Fred Brummer for leading the charge in the Legislature to 
rid Floridians of this burdensome and fundamentally unfair tax. The repeal
of this tax eliminates the penalty on Floridians who take responsibility for
their own retirement by saving and investing over a lifetime. It will save 
300,000 taxpayers more than $131 million next year.  It is a bad tax.
Florida will no longer discourage its citizens from preparing for the
future. I am proud of the hard work of the Florida Legislature on behalf of 
Florida's taxpayers. Since 1999, we have worked with the Legislature to
provide our citizens and growing businesses more than $19 billion in tax
relief. Finally, I thank President Tom Lee and Speaker Allan Bense for their 
leadership and continued attention to important tax relief issues.

Subject:	[*] pardon

Dear Govenor Bush
i have written to your office three times, last time in current to ask for a personal pardon, for a crime i didnt commit
i served honorably in vietnam and shortly after my return i was beaten by a deputy named herb grimes, which i proved
was done wrongfully. in my law suit that was handled by a dennis j plews of manatee county i had been promised that
if i would settle for a meer $10.000 that because he had lied they would decertifie him it was never done!. and i suffered
untold harrassment by his friends. my life was even threatend that if they couldnt get him back on they would kill me!.
he stayed on the bradenton police department as he worked as head of security at tropicana orange company.
after time passed he came back on the manatee county sheriffs office in a higher position than he had been disscharged from,
less than a few weeks later two friends of grimes. a deputy henderson and fieber showed up at my house at one in the morning
on a complaint that was over a supposed cb radio despute that by record was supposed to have been reported a 9pm that evening
when they attempted to enter my home threating me over what made no sense i was in mortal fear for my life and when attacked in my bedroom
by these men with no warrent and no apparent reason for being there i tryed to defend myself with a old 22 rifle my father had given me by showing it to them and asking that they leave my home. dureing the trial none of these facts were allowed to be brought out and when i tryed to
prove grimes was behind it all i was told if i brought his name up again they would lock me in the back and hold the trial without me being there.
i dont know what kinda deal my attourney at that time made with the assistant attourney but john cole my attourney couldnt even recite case historys the state attourney had to finish them for him and even the state attourney at the end of trial said it wasnt right to send someone to prison on a first offence. but the judge said he had no discretion in the matter. over the years now i have written every part of the judical system
with no resolve, its like i dont matter at all. govenor martineze's office when i sent a registered letter to, miss ottey gooding said to never send another registerd letter again she handled all the govenors corrospondence. yet a week later i read in the paper he had time to play a tv role in some james bond flick. in any case i just turned 50 this july and since my auto accident i cant do much but i worked security before my good name was tarnished and if you could find it in your heart to help me out without all the red tape maybe i could get me a little job doing security again to supplement my dissabilty so i can live like normal people. besides i used to like to go hunting with my dad who is dead now and because of whats been done i havent been able to since before he died and i really miss that as my father was a ex police officer and kept telling me it would all work out and we would go again soon!. he died and we never did.
Dear Jeb Bush i dont have the money to fight or any hope left which is why im writting you cant you find it in your heart to lift this injustice off of me so i can as a veteran have the right to serve and protect and not have to make excuses when my friends wan to go hunting and die a little each time they bring back a nice dear or boar i cant even share the hope for!.
so far the aids that you assigned in the past years have done nothing to help me so im asking you. 
PLEASE CANT YOU HELP?

Governor Bush,

Please accept this recommendation for James DeKleva for
Circuit Judge of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and
for Seminole County, Florida.  As I have recently
written to you about Mr. DeKleva, I will keep this
short.

I know Mr. DeKleva as a fellow attorney and personal
friend.  I previously wrote to you some months ago when
is name was before you for a County Judge position.  At
that time, I discussed Mr. DeKleva's core conservative
beliefs, family values, and reputaion for intgrity. 
His reputation in the legal community is simply
unimpeachable.  There is no better candidate to serve
as judge, which is why the local Judicial Nominating
Commission returned his name to you so quickly.  

I know that the making of judicial appointments is a
responsibility with which you have given heightened
personal scrutiny.  I strongly urge you to do the same
on this one.  Mr. DeKleva's interview is Monday the
31st.  If your schedule permits, take some time to
visit the candidates; I am extremely confident that if
you met Mr. DeKleva, you would take great pride and
comfort in adding him to our impeccable list of Florida
jurists.

With full confidence in James DeKleva, I am:

RE: Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR)

 

July 28, 2006

 

 

Please read following letter I received from the Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) regarding Palm Bay’s proposed ordinance regarding legal workers. 

 

I was shocked and dismayed that a State Commission sent a letter. It is very apparent that the Commission did not read the current version of the ordinance. It is a very overt attempt to affect the outcome of a local issue. I feel that the commission should be educated on the facts and refrain from making assumptions based on inaccurate information.

 

Any assistance in this matter would be appreciated. 

 

I was informed that a member (staff or commissioner) will attend the council meeting to speak against the ordinance. This may be embarrassing for the State if they do not have the facts.

 

Respectfully,

Councilman Andy Anderson

120 Malabar Rd SE

Palm Bay, FL 32907

 

Dear Councilman Anderson,

 

The Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) has strong concerns with the potential consequences of the proposed illegal immigration ordinance that will be considered during the August 3rd Palm Bay City Council meeting.  FCHR is the state agency charged with enforcing the Florida Civil Rights Act.  The Florida Legislature has declared that the purpose of these laws is to protect the people of Florida from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status or familial status.  

 

FCHR believes that this proposal could lead to unlawful and discriminatory activities in your community.  A city ordinance of this nature will likely create a hostile and divisive environment that could result in hate crimes, racial/ethnic profiling and unlawful, discriminatory acts against all members of many ethnic groups.  These are the types of actions that we must collectively work together to prevent.  We were pleased that the ordinance was tabled during your last meeting so that adequate time and consideration of all possible ramifications could be weighed.

 

At FCHR, it is our duty to ensure that the civil and human rights of Florida residents are protected to the fullest extent of the law.  Therefore, we will monitor the situation very closely and will respond promptly to any violation of Florida law.  As a nation based on freedom, we urge you to consider all of the consequences that could result if such a proposal is passed.  Thank you for your consideration of this critical matter.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	US Flag Etiquette

Hello Jeb, I am the president of the Timber Pines Community Association, we are a gated senior community in Spring Hill (Hernando County) FL.  Our community has 3452 homes comprising some 57 individual villages, having some 6,000 residents. 
 
As we are a senior community, many of the residents are either retired military or served in the various branches of the military.  A practice that has been on going for several years has been to lower the US flag  to half staff at the entrance to the village where a service connected person has past on.
 
We recently received a letter from a retired US Air Force person complaining about the disrespect that was being displayed by lowering the flag without proper authorization. 
 
We are aware that there are specific days that this can be done, and that only the President or the Governor can authorize any exceptions.
 
Since we are a self contained community (walled with gated  access), is it possible to obtain permission from you the Governor to allow us continue lowering the flag at the death of these service related people?
 
Sincerely,
 
John Gauthier Director/President

        Hi my name is Deborah McWhorter. I am writing you about the possible moving of the 46th test Wing or part of it.

My husband has worked with the Operation and Maintenance contract for over 25 five years. I just wanted to let you know that I think that it is wrong when one person or a small group can change things that the Brac Commission voted to leave in place and the President approved. I do not see how the air force can save money by cutting at Eglin and having to build at Edwards and Edwards would not have the personal with the experience that the people at Eglin have.

I also want to bring up the water range that has been added to Eglin’s range capability that would not be available at Edwards. It bothers me that some one tried to do this with out the people being affected knowing about it till the move was made.

Why would some one want to cut development and testing in time of war?  Eglin is where the bunker busting bomb was developed and tested from the ground up. If the Air Force needs more of the same kind of development and testing it needs to stay at Eglin. I think other ways of saving money should be looked at.! I think something should be done to stop what is happening. How can Edwards handle more development and testing when California has power problems? Please let me hear from you.

Governor Bush,

Teenagers face more challenges today than  any previous generation. As parents and citizens it is increasingly dishearting to witness the increase in addictions, suicide, behavioral and emtional problems plaguing our youth today. In an effort to do something regarding these problems and support parents and families coping with teenagers and  these issues, I am organizing a benefit walk for Teen Intervention (www.Intervene4ateen.com). The walk is in the form of a 5k benefit at Maclay Gardens on August 5, 2006. This is part of a national initiative with 17 seperate fund raisers taking place across the United States and Canada on this day to raise awareness and show support for Teens. There are 2 walks scheduled in Florida and I would like ours to be the best and most productive. Any assistane you or your staff could give will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your prayers and support of our youth.

Sir; BayNews9.com, viewer comments: Had a question regarding how we feel about illegals in this country; 90% are strongly against it; the issue has been in the forefront a long time, on all levels; it will be a major issue in future political decisions made by the public; we don't want the illegals for MANY reasons - read the polls and opinions.
 
Why, then, do we encourage these people by allowing them welfare without any proof of who they are, and a promise not to contact INS about their illegal (criminal) presence nor the illegal (criminal) presence of their children?  Why are American citizens required to have a social security number and the illegal criminals emphatically told they don't need one???
 
I'm so tired of my tax dollars feeding these leeches, yet when we need benefits for just a few weeks, we're denied.
 
Take the money that is spent on illegals and put it into any projects that improve the lives of the taxpayers who fund it rather than hand it to illegals who come here strictly for that purpose.

Dear Governor Bush,

          Please accept my recommendation for Mike Gotschall as judge for 
the 18th Judicial Circuit in Florida.

          I have known Mike and his family for about twenty years.  In his 
career as an attorney he represented my husband and me in a civil matter 
without charge and was able to obtain excellent results for us.  His 
knowledge of the law was exceptional and the results he obtained for us was 
proof of this.  We continue to hold him in the highest regard as he has 
always exhibited the qualities that I believe make a great judge. Please 
consider giving him this appointment as I feel the citizens of Seminole 
County would benefit from his innate sense of fairness and honesty.

     I am currently a resident of Sarasota County but having lived in 
Orlando for 22 years felt that I wanted to express my desire that such a 
fine man be nominated to the Circuit Court in Seminole County.

                                                                Very truly

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bush,
    I am a Kindergarten teacher at Trenton Elementary School in Gilchrist County.  As you may know we have been rated the number one county in the state of Florida because all of our schools in our county were rated "A" schools ( and we were the only county in the whole state to have all schools rated an "A").  I am very proud of our students, teachers, administrators, and parents and feel that our county deserves a little treat.  I would like to personally invite you and your brother (the president) to visit our county and our schools, at your convenience of course.  It would be a special treat for our students to have their Governor, President of the United States, and their wives visit them, and let them know how proud you are of them.  Maybe you could even read to some of our classes - that would be great!
 
    I know that I'm asking a lot of you, to take time out of your busy schedule, but I know that this would be so special for the kids.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hello. My name is Luis Engracio.  I am asking for a few minutes of your time for some information. I live in Madison county and want to open a motorcycle repair shop to help an almost dead pinetta Fl and maybe put some kids to work learning a trade. I had some money save and used it to buy 1 acre of commercial property. I am a Cuban American born and raised in Florida. And in my small town there is no jobs for our kids and this would be a good start for some. My question is two. First is there a grant that would help me go to a Daytona base tech school. I do have a motorcycle degree but would like to further my education at the AMI in Daytona. Also is there a grant for minority for the use to open a motorcycle repair shop and Scholl to teach the local young adult a skill to keep them off the street and out of trouble. Please if possible point me in the direction to help achieve this goal. I have never asked for anything and what i ask for now is more community related than for my self.
Thank you for your time.

 Governor Bush:

Dear Governor Bush,

I understand there was much talk last year with  a Florida Representative 
and the Southern Offshore Fishing Association (SOFA) located in  Maderia 
Beach, FL concerning the commercial fishing industry and either a Federal 
or State  buy back program for commercial longliners. There has been 
speculation and interest regarding this topic amongst many small  “bandit” 
or hook and line commercial fishing owners regarding their ability to join 
this program, who also are federally documented and individually are 
relied upon for their families’ survival.

I have searched and searched with little success to find a definitive 
answer to the ACTUAL outcome of this subject and whether there really is 
something pending for current or future consideration, or if this was just 
something that was never actually lobbied, but just spoken about.

Personally, I would like an immediate response, as the answer will help us 
determine our current pending decision making concerning our family’s 
welfare, future, and financial security. You may or may not know, there 
has been a progressive fishing decline in past years, moratoriums and 
closures, all which have financial crippled the commercial fisherman’s 
lively hood and ability to maintain an adequate financial security.  We 
are individual owners of small boats, trying to make a living the old 
fashion way, and not large fleet owners with massive miles of hook and 
line.

I look forward to hearing from you very soon, and in advance appreciate 
your office’s consideration and research into this matter. I have also 
sent this letter to both Florida Senators, several Representatives and a 
Congresswoman, and President Bush’s office.

Respectfully submitted.

Thank you for your Florida Leadership. 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush: I normally don't send letters of recommendation. But in this case I think all the input you can receive  will help in your decision. Michael Gotschall is my step son so I am already prejudiced. I am a retired Navy man and have lived in Florida since 1954'. I have seen a lot in the development of politics among other things. Good people in politics are hard to find due to personal desires, public pressure, and political pressure so when someone comes along that you honestly feel qualified for a job and not under political pressure you want to help them as much as you can. Michael has the experience, qualifications, and desire to do a good job. I am not biased toward him as my stepson but of an individual that has the experience and desire to be a good public servant. Thank you for your strong consideration of Michael for a position as circuit judge in Seminole county. Respectfully yours,  Eldon Ward. CDR, USN-R

Subject:	Fundraiser for Leukemia Victims

To Whom It May Concern:

 

My name is Barbara Pierson.  My Godson, Elijah Gardner, who is 6 years old  (my sister's Grandson), has been diagnosed with terminal leukemia (AML). 

 

Our family has had an inordinate number of tragedies over the past 18 months, and I won't attempt to explain them to you in the context of this email.  Allow me to merely state that in dealing with Elijah's illness, the inadequacies of the system have become enormously apparent.  Having said that, hopefully in a non-judgmental manner, I have chosen to assist the Post Oncology Support Team (POST) of St. Mary's Hospital, Elijah and other families that are in the same stressful place as ours and organize a fundraiser in conjunction with the POST group.  Elijah and numerous other children receive their weekly, bi-weekly, monthly and sometimes daily treatments and post-care from this group of dedicated persons, whose resources as highly limited.

 

The fundraiser will be held October 25, 2006  -  6:00 PM - 9:30 PM at the Palm Beach Polo Club in Wellington Florida.   

 

We are planning a variety of special events, including a silent auction, wonderful food and drink, just to name a few. A number of celebrities, press and notable personalities have been invited and, I am certain, will be in attendance.

 

This could be a great opportunity for the Governor and Mr. Crist, both politically and charitably if their schedules would allow them to attend and perhaps donate a photo op or other press related activity.

 

I would welcome the opportunity to speak with your Press and/or Social Secretary to explain all the details to see what might be feasible.

Dear Governor Bush,
     My name is Tom Millican and I am Chairman of Alternative Energy Resources, LLC. I am writing to let you know that I would like to build in the state of Florida three 26 million gallon ethanol plants, estimated to cost $144 million dollars. In addition to that I would also like to build 210 ethanol only service stations. 
     I will not be looking for any tax incentaives. This will be just a straight up deal. I would like to put one plant between Pensecola and Tallahasse: between Jacksonville and Orlando: between Orlando and Miami. 
     I would also like to receive what I presume to be a public record of the current amount of gasoline that is sold inside of Florida. 
     Lastly, I would like to find out what, if any legislation is in existence or being planned regarding this type of production.
     Thanks for your time and I hope to meet you soon.

Respectfully,
Tom Millican

Dear Governor Bush

I understand that Ms. Louise B. Zeuli has been submitted to you for consideration to fill the open 18th Judicial Circuit Judge position. I am very pleased to write this e-mail of recommendation on her behalf.

Louise is a multifaceted individual, having had training and experience in many areas and professions, including, of course, the legal profession. I understand she has also had much experience as a mediator which many times serves as excellent preparation for judgeship. She is a member of my Rotary Club and I have had the privilege of working with her on the Board and on the Charity Selection Committee and her approach has consistently been inclusive, analytical and decisive. I believe her broad experience and approach to issues will translate to excellent skills as a jurist.

I recommend that you appoint Louise to fill this vacant seat on our bench as she will represent the Judiciary well.

Thank you for your consideration of this recommendation.

Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I understand that Mr. Jim DeKleva's name has been submitted to you for consideration by the Judicial Nominating Committee for the 18th Judicial Circuit open bench position. I am very pleased to write this e-mail of recommendation on his behalf.

Jim has practiced in Seminole County for many years and is very familiar with our County and its local issues. He is respected by and has an excellent reputation with attorneys practicing in our area, including myself. As our areas of legal expertise diverge, I have referred numerous clients and acquaintances to Jim and all have had nothing but positive things to say about his handling of their case and about him personally. His demeanor and "no nonsense" attitude will be a welcome addition to our bench. I have no doubt that, following his appointment, he will serve the citizens of our County extremely well.

I urge you to appoint Jim to this position as I have no doubt that he will represent the Judiciary with authority and respect.

Thank you for your consideration of this recommendation.

I am writing in support of US Representative Ginny Brown-Waite's request for special legislative sessions to address the  home owners insurance crisis for Floridians. My home is insured by State Farm (I have been with them over 23 years). As you are probably aware, State Farm is seeking a substancial rate increase. Although a 4th generation native Floridian, between auto insurance and home owners rate increases my husband and I are seriously considering relocating to another state.

Subject:	Urgent Need for Your Help

(athis may be a duplicate -- I tried to send it
through the "myflorida" site, and I am not sure it
went)

Dear Governor Bush,
You appoint the Early Learning Coalition Chairs and
are about to appoint the new one for St. Johns/Putnam.
Before you do, I want to take 3 minutes to give you a
perspective from my 15+ years as the participant in NE
Florida on two Coalitions --Healthy Start, and Early
Learning.

The Coalition process can be a powerful one with
communities bringing programs together for
collaboration, reduced duplication, and local control
and problem solving. The NE FL Healthy Start Coalition
is outstanding --exceedingly well organized, managed,
and accountable. This is in part due to the fact that
staff are highly qualified and housed at the Regional
Planning Offices in Jacksonville -- which gives
important structure and a long history of successful
administration.
The Early Learning Coalition (first St. Johns, and now
the merged St.Johns and Putnam) on the other hand has
greatly struggled from the beginning. This is due in
part to competition for control of the Coalition and
money, poor QI/QA processes, entities thinking they
don't have to meet the terms of contracts, and to a
great extent, very poor staff management of the
processes.  AWI is giving good feedback and
suggestions, but the local folks are really having
difficulty.  From my perspective as a participant in
both groups from the inception of each -- savy
leadership without a conflict of interest is key.  
---Ester Tibbs from Gainesville DCF is a
strong example of that kind of leadership. She holds a
special recognition called the "Silver Award" as a
certified trainer in correct procedures for meetings,
etc. She is articulate, objective, and dedicated. I
have great admiration for her skills. She
would be an excellent choice as Chair of the St.
Johns,Putnam Early Learning Coalition however, she is
not from the private sector.  She has the background
to pull us out of a very deep hole.
--- OR, would it be possible to put the Early Learning
Coalition under the guidance of the Regional Planning
Offices in Jacksonville (they already serve these two
counties in other ways)?  I spoke with Brian Teeples
-- the Director there -- about the challenges we have
faced with the Early Learning Coalition procedures and
he offered any help he could give. They helped in the
past by giving a two day trianing on QI/QA processes
and techniques.

Help can be given and received only if welcomed.
That is the challenge. There has got to be a way to
make this process better serve the needs of the
communities involved through more effective management
at the local level. You will
note that both counties have very low (among the
lowest 5 counties in the state) Pre-K summer school
enrollment. That is just a small indicator.

Sorry for the lengthy message - I know you are busy.
I just wanted to make you aware of a great need on a
local level with some possible solutions.
I wish you the best as you move beyond the duties of
Governor of Florida! My family and I are strong
supporters of you and your brother as you lead our
country and state through tough times.  Good work --
it can't be easy with so much constant negative
feedback from a variety of sources. My son serves in
Kuwait as a private sector member of the Signal
Command with the Army Central Command. He has been
there since the beginning of the war.

Kathy Mankinen

Governor Bush:
   I read where the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council has said that you must call a special session of the Legislature to try and breathe life back into Florida's collapsed home resale market. Yes, the market has already collapsed. It collapsed because of your stubborn failure to call such a session right after the scheduled session failed to pass the only viable answer to the property insurance mess.
   The State of Florida needs a State Catastrophe Property Insurance Program with a state wide single per $1,000 of insured value premium rate that will cover all forms of natural or terrorist catastrophes. Yes, the same per $1,000 of insured value premium rate throughout Florida is necessary to solve the problem. Area, or regional rates are a part of the present problem, and they fail to recognize that Florida is a long narrow state that even "inland areas" are not safe from hurricanes, or tsunamis, earthquakes, or terrorist acts.
   Some facts: Over 25% of Floridian's have dropped their homeowner's insurance protection; Foreclosures have doubled, and the exhorbitant premium rates are the fault; Home for sale listings are up about 400% while home resales have slowed to a trickle as for sale signs litter our lawns.
   If you fail to call the special session, you will be labeled "The One Man Wrecking Team", the Governor who couldn't handle the single major crisis he faced during his period in office, as Florida's economy continues on it's way into the tank with the real estate market.
   Sincerely, Michael Fitzpatrick,

I have lived in Florida for many many more years then you have and it now looks as though in our GOLDEN YEARS we could lose everything we have worked the 34 years we have lived here because of the INSANE insurance rates of homeowners insurance in this state. I wish we could sell our home and get out of this state but that is not even possible anymore as NO ONE wants to have to pay more than $5,000.00 a year for homeowners insurance. I live in Holiday and we have MORE than 100.000 population in this town and last week listed in the newspaper only FOUR homes were sold, that is pathetic! We do Not live in a fancy home in fact it was built in 1967 and is  a subdivision home. I am one of the very unlucky ones who live a few hundred feet west of US 19 and have to have the wind and hail policy in addition to homeowners. I guess I am lucky I do not live in a flood zone. I would like to know how that wind KNOWS how to stop at US 19 as if the people living just a few hundred feet across US 19 do NOT have to pay for the wind and hail policy and if their roof gets blown off their insurance WILL pay to put it back on. Something is wrong with this picture. I do not live near the water and I believe that people who can afford living on the water SHOULD pay for that but I do not believe I should pay so they can enjoy living on the water. Something is very bad wrong with the insurance in Florida and needs to be fixed NOW. 
You have ignored this problem from the beginning and NOW it is time to face the problem before you have 1000's marching on Tallahassee. I have said it before and will say it again that every politician in this state needs to hang their heads in SHAME for what they are doing to the citizens of this state who voted them in. I belong to HAC an we are trying VERY hard to let the rest of this country know what is going on here in Florida and let them know NOT to come here unless they have BIG BUCKS as that seems to be what you all want. Just remember even the rich need teachers, police,EMS workers, the hairdresser your wives go to the barbers, the farmers and where the heck are these people going to live as NO ONE in those positions can longer afford to live here. 
Politicians MADE this problem with greed and corruption and now THEY need to do something to fix it NOW Call a special session to do something NOW.

Mr. Governor:
 
When are  you going to address this aituation, when you are out of office and "in the clear" so to speak or are you going to leave your position knowing you did everything for the residents of Florida.  The people are tired of politicians and empty promises, lies and ignorance.  Your attitude of "well they are either going to have to leave Florida or pay the insuirance rates is one of downright insult and offense to the people who put you in office.  Your insurance commissioner has the audacity to run for your position.  You and your cabinet are ignoring a very crucial time in Florida history and all you can worry about is going over seas to promote tourism to a state that might not have many inhabitants very soon because you don't care about the people that put you where you are. The rumor going around that your office is helping to promote the eradication of Florida as we know it seems to be more truthful each day.  Why not let the insurance dilemma pretty much wipe out the poor and middle class, let there be foreclosures so the developers can come in and scoop up the houses for pennies on the dollar from the lending institutions and just rebuild Florida for the rich.  Who do you think will serve those affulent new Floridians.  Hey maybe you will just ferry in some illegal immigrants to work the stores and communiities,  Your responsibility is to the Florida now population, not to the future Floridians.  These people put you in one of the highest positions a person could dream of and you have taken away the dream that all have built.  Your ignoring this very serious issue only proves that you are not a man of your word. You promised answers and remedies- WE DO NOT SEE THEM-WE DO NOT SEE YOU WORKING ON THEM.  WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY SESSION NOW You still have time to make the last portion of your term remembered by all Floridians as the governor stepping in for his people.  Turn the negative into a positive. do it FOR THE PEOPLE

I just read an article that the insurance company I have, Statefarm is going to amend it's rate increase it is asking fr to a higher rate. If this happens we will be moving out of Florida as soon as we can sell our home. I am a fifth generation Floridian who is being run out of Florida by the GREEDY Insurance companies. As it is my parents who own their home and are stuck with Citizens Insurance will be without ANY insurance as of September because the policy has gone from $780....to $1200...to $3200 to $5000!!!!!
 
Virginia Stevans
Floridian & Homeowner for now! 
 
 
 
"He has reviewed State Farm's filing, which the company now intends to
amend because it says the rate increase it asked for isn't high enough
to cover its reinsurance expense.

State Farm had actually asked for two rate hikes -- one, an average 58.8
percent statewide, was to cover the increased cost of reinsurance. The
company will amend this filing. The company is dropping the second
request -- 12.7 percent statewide -- which had been intended to cover
higher storm costs this year."

Your Honorable Governor:
We lost one of our County Commissioners, (Rob Schenck) for the Hernando
County Board of Commissioners recently. You have an application from
Janey Baldwin to fill that slot.  We don't feel she is the right
candidate for this position.  I served on a board with her in our
community until it was necessary to ask her to resign.
She has been combative, does not follow protocol, repeats herself and
gets confused.  I feel she may be more of a hindrance for the remaining
board. Her service would only be for the next 3 months. 
We in the county do not feel she can do the job that will be required of
her. 
I hope you will take these things into consideration.
Than you.

Dear Friend: 

What follows is my letter to Governor Bush after Governor Bush endorsed Jim King. I pray you will read it, and send it to everyone you know. 

Hello Mr. Governor. 

As you can imagine, I, my staff, and thousands of my friends and supporters in District 8 were heartily disappointed by your endorsement of Senator Jim King in our Republican primary. I believe it was a tremendous mistake. And I believe the next few days and weeks will bear that out. 

As you (better than most) know, Senator King - even though he claims to be a Republican - has repeatedly worked against you and your Republican agenda. For example: 

- Senator King fought against you when you introduced your budget in 2004, calling it "mean-spirited"; 

- Senator King derailed your efforts at true medical malpractice reform; 

- Senator King appointed 16 Democrats to chairmanships and vice chairmanships of committees when he was Senate President; 

- Senator King tried to use state monies to build a fire department next to his vacation home in Putnam County (a bill which you vetoed, thankfully); 

- Senator King complained about your veto, and you rightly called him a "baby;" 

- Senator King took an illegal $48,000 private plane trip to Canada -- funded by a gambling casino, forcing the State Republican party to use our contributions to pay back the $48,000; you condemned the entire affair; 

- Senator King voted to give illegal immigrants college tuition with our tax money; 

- Senator King denied you your constitutional right to appoint the new 55 judges our state is going to have; those new judges would have been able to represent our conservative legal philosophy -instead, Senator King insisted that they be put to a vote by the public at large. (You strongly condemned this action in writing.) 

But worse yet - Senator King's social agenda is indistinguishable from that of a Democrat. 

- Senator King believes in slaying the innocent unborn and exploiting women by abortion - but you are pro-life; 

- Senator King supports permitting homosexual "couples" to adopt children - but you oppose homosexuals adopting children; 

- Senator King fought to starve Terri Schiavo - an innocent woman - to death, even while you advocated saving her life. (Think of how Bob and Mary Schindler will feel when they hear the news of your support of Senator King.) I will leave my effectiveness in the fight for Terri's life to the family, history, and eternity to judge. One thing is certain: Senator King fought to starve her, and now you have endorsed him. 

Mr. Governor, a man with the political history and social agenda of Senator King does not deserve the endorsement of a man of your stature and character. 

But more importantly - and I speak to you now as a fellow Christian - by embracing the ethical evils of the "culture of death," Senator King has denied certain fundamental principles of our faith. How could you ignore our faith, and the teachings of our Lord, to embrace a man who scoffs at and denigrates the very essence of that faith as it relates to life and family? Can we claim to be a friend of Faith and Family while we help those who wage a policy war against our families and our faith? 

This long list of policy positions held by Senator King should have been enough to keep you from endorsing him. Unfortunately, it did not. Your core values and faith should have kept you from endorsing him. Unfortunately, they did not rise to the occasion. 

Sadly, over the next few days and weeks some very disturbing news is about to brought to light about Senator King. As it emerges, I hope you will publicly retract your support for Mr. King. You owe it to your supporters to do so. You owe it to the loyal Republicans of this district and this state who support the Republican Party Platform, and who have voted for you in the past because they thought you supported that platform as well. By endorsing Senator King, you have called your entire belief system, priorities, and public policy statements and positions into question. 

Sincerely, 

Randall Terry 

Well Friend, there it is. I tried to be diplomatic, but honest. I hope I succeeded. I believe this letter deals with what is eating away at our party's heart and soul. If you agree, please forward it to your friends. 

And I ask you to give any contribution you possibly can towards my election. We are gathering momentum, building a great team, and getting to huge numbers of houses as we go door to door. This is why Jim King's people are terrified! 

But we still need to raise money! I hate it, but we need contributions to win! 

Please; do whatever you can. And ask your friends to do the same! Every single gift matters, no matter what the size. Go to http://www.randallterry.com to contribute on line, or you can mail a check to Randall Terry for Florida Senate, PO Box 3886, St. Aug. FL, 32085. 

God bless you, and long life to you.

regarding homeowner's insurance. I keep being told that our representatives are trying but not getting help in having a special session over the
homeowner insurance problem. I have been told they    "go home in disgust
because I can't do anything". Why is that? Why and who is preventing an honest open review of something that is effecting many homeowners and business owners? I do not comprehend why the three most powerful people in this state have done NOTHING. Speaker Bense and Senate President Lee and you have received emails from me today. I want to know why, as a citizen, a voter, and a homeowner, that I feel no one is actually representing me. That no one is actually representing any of the voters/citizens of this state. I do not see anything happening, other than a rate increase granted to State Farm. I see the public being told the OIR is displeased that we didn't come to their meetings, which we did not know about, so how can one attend? Are the meetings deliberately held without public announcement? Giving a "press release" and "leaving it to the media" to tell the people? I always took pride in casting my vote, of researching the issues the candidates put forward, how they responded to issues I was concerned about, but, it seems that once elected they only represent themselves or their interests. Insurance rate doubling or tripling in two years will destroy some of us. I think I will have to look to the Governor's Office and the State's Legislature as the reason. Enhance Citizens, restructure it as an all inclusive company, sell all types of insurance and NOT at a higher rate than the other insurance companies, and let them leave the state. It is a sad day when we see the government of Florida forsake the people they represent! Christina Ennist meowhouse2002@tampabay.rr.com

   IN MY OPINION: 
 
 I HOPE THAT YOU WILL COME BACK TO YANKEETOWN AND DO THE "REAL STORY"  NOT THE "MAYOR'S STORY" AND INTERVIEW THE MAJORITY OF CITIZENS WHO ARE FED UP WITH THE  MAYOR, FORMER MAYOR, FORMER AND PRESENT LAWYERS, FORMER ZONING OFFICERS, COUNCIL PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS CONSPIRACY IN MY OPINION THIS STATE HAS EVER SEEN. CITIZENS ARE WAITING TO SEE IF THERE REALLY IS JUSTICE FOR CITIZENS AND A TOWN OVER TAKEN BY WHAT WE FEEL ARE CROOKED POLITICIANS AND NONTRUTHFUL LAND FLIPPERS (CALLING THEMSELVES DEVELOPERS.) 
 
GO LOOK INTO THE SAME DEAL THIS "DEVELOPER" PULLED ON 12 TO 13 BUSINESSES IN INDIAN ROCKS BEACH 2 YEARS AGO AND EVERYONE IS IN COURT. CALL THE INDIAN ROCKS BEACH CITY HALL AND ASK ABOUT JIM SHERWOOD AND WHAT HE DID TO THAT CITY. OUR MAYOR IS FROM THERE TOO AND IS 1/3 OWNER OF A GIANT REAL ESTATE FIRM EMPLOYING OVER 100 PEOPLE IN 4 DIFFERENT CITY OFFICES DOWN THERE. 
 
THE FORMER MAYOR, ZONING OFFICER AND LAWYER AND FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER WITH HER MARINA UNDER CONTRACT HID THIS MARINA PROJECT FOR MONTHS. ONE OF THE MARINA OWNERS WAS ON THE COUNCIL AND BEST FRIENDS WITH THE PRESENT MAYOR WHO WAS ON THE COUNCIL WITH HER AND NO ONE REVEALED THIS GIANT DEVELOPMENT THAT WANTS TO COME IN AND DESTROY OUR TOWN BY EVERY MEANS BUT THE RULES. WE COULD HAVE STOOD BUILDING BY THE RULES BUT THAT IS NOT PROFITABLE TO THEM. OVER TAKING THE TOWN COUNCIL WITH EITHER BRIBES OR SOMETHING TO MAKE THESE COUNCIL PEOPLE AND MAYOR DENY THE MAJORITY OF THE CITIZENS THE RIGHT TO EVEN SPEAK AT TOWN MEETINGS AND VOTING TO FAVOR EVERY REQUEST OF THESE "LAND FLIPPERS" HAS THE CITIZENS IRATE. 
 
SO FAR GOING TO THE ETHICS COMMISSION  HAS BEEN  A JOKE ALONG WITH THE SUNSHINE LAW VIOLATION BEING PUNISHABLE. WHERE HAS OUR GOVERNMENT GONE? SO FAR TO PROTECTING THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS PUBLIC OFFICE HOLDERS WHILE THEY DENY CITIZENS RIGHTS OF AN HONEST AND OPEN GOVERNMENT GOVERNED BY THE RULES. 
 
THE FDLE IS INVESTIGATING THE MAYOR AND HOPEFULLY MORE PEOPLE.  WE QUESTION THE MAYOR AND CREW CAUGHT SHREDDING TOWN PAPERS ON A SUNDAY EVENING AND PUTTING THEM IN THE RECYCLE TRAILOR, THE MAYOR TAKING ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS FROM TOWN HALL AND NOT RETURNING THEM, TOTAL DISREGARD BY HER OF THE LAWS, RUNNING TOWN HALL FROM HER HOME, HARRASSING THE TOWN EMPLOYEES TILL THEY QUIT,  AND VIOLATIONS OF CITIZENS RIGHTS IN PUBLIC MEETINGS. 
 
WE HAVE HAD RESIGNED COUNCIL PEOPLE RESEND THEIR RESIGNATION AND COME BACK AND VOTE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE HAD THE LAWYER HELP HIDE THE DEVELOPMENT WHILE BILLING THE TOWN BIG DOLLARS WORKING WITH THE DEVELOPERS ON TOWN MONEY. WE HAVE HAD THE RESIGNED LAWYER PRIVATELY REPRESENT THE MAYOR UNDER RECALL SUING THE TOWN WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REPRESENTING THE TOWN CLERK BEING SUED BY THE DEVELOPERS AND HE IS RESIGNED? ASM THE TOWN ATTORNEY. WE HAVE HAD 3 OR 4 BREAK-INS IN TOWN HALL IN THE LAST 3 WEEKS THAT I BELIEVE ONLY THE MAYOR HAD ACCESS TO THE KEYS USED TO OPEN THE FILES. MANY BELIEVE THIS WAS STAGED TO COVER UP WHAT MISSING DOCUMENTS WILL TURN UP IN THE INVESTIGATION. (CALL THE LEVY COUNTY SHERIFF OFFICE 1-800-538-9767) (CALL THE FDLE 386 418-5412) THE DEVELOPERS CLAIMED FROM THE BEGINNING IN WRITING THEY WERE THE REGISTERED AGENTS FOR YANKEETOWN MARINA AND THEY WERE NOT. (THIS IS 2 OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS THE MAYOR TOOK FROM TOWN HALL MONTHS AGO AND THEY ARE NOT BACK THERE TODAY.) THE OWNER OF THE MARINA HAS REQUESTED TO SEE AND GET COPIES OF THEM THEM WELL OVER 25 TIMES SINCE THEY WERE DROPPED OFF BY THE DEVELOPERS. I WITNESSED MANY OF THESE REQUEST.  
 
 THE DEVELOPERS LIED IN THE PUBLIC MEETING ABOUT THE YANKEETOWN MARINA, PRESENTING THE PROJECT ALMOST A YEAR AFTER THE TOWN LEADERS AND LAWYER HAD WORKED WITH THEM SECRETLY. I COULD GO ON AND ON. BY THE WAY OUR TOWN CHARTER LETS THE MAYOR PICK REPLACEMENTS TO THE TOWN COUNCIL WHEN THERE IS A RESIGNATION. THE MAYOR RAN UNOPPOSED AND HER RESIGNATION FROM COUNCIL WAS NOT TILL AFTER SHE BECAME MAYOR SO HER FIRST DUTY WAS TO REPLACE HER SEAT WITH A DEVELOPER. AFTER THE COUNCIL PERSON (MAYOR'S FRIEND) WHO HAD HER MARINA UNDER CONTRACT AND NEVER REVEALED THIS MARINA PROJECT WHILE VOTING ALMOST 6 MONTHS FINALLY RESIGNED, THE MAYOR GOT TO PICK THAT REPLACEMENT. 
 
AFTER THE GOVERNOR DECLARED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO HELP YANKEETOWN REGAIN ORDER, THE MAYOR HELD A TOWN MEETING WITH 2 COUNCIL PEOPLE MAKING MOTIONS AND VOTING TO ACCEPT RESOLUTIONS BY THE 2 OF THEM. ONE OF THESE RESLOUTIONS WAS ACTED ON BEFORE THE 10 DAY PERIOD DECLARED BY THE GOVERNOR. AT THIS MEETING THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY ADVERTISED, THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS A HIRED LAWYER WERE DENIED INPUT OR COMMENTS AFTER THE COUNCIL STARTED THE ACTUAL MOTIONING. THE MAYOR IS OUT OF CONTROL. 
 
WE DO HAVE A TOWN OUT OF CONTROL. IT STARTED WITH A BUNCH OF LYING SO CALLED DEVELOPERS BUT IT IS THE ACTIONS OF THE TOWN GOVERNMENT HIDING, LYING, MANIPULATING, AND NOW PROMOTING THIS DEVELOPMENT IN ANYWAY POSSIBLE FOR IT TO SUCCEED THAT HAS THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE FED UP. THEN GO TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FOR HELP CLAIMING VIOLATIONS OF SUNSHINE LAW, VIOLATIONS OF A PERSONS RIGHTS TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH, BREAKING OF LAWS BY ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE UNDER OATH AND GET TURNED AWAY. .. 
 
FINALLY THE GOVERNOR HAS STEPPED IN .. BUT IF THIS DOES NOT GAIN BACK THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THEN SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. THIS TOWN GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF CONTROL, THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP AND IF THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT (FDLE) AND LEVY COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ARE SUCCESSFUL... THEN MOST OF THE CITIZENS FEEL THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE ARRESTS...
 
AND I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT YOU CHANNEL 10 WILL COME BACK TO TOWN SOON  AND ALLOW THE "REAL" STORY TO BE TOLD BY THE CITIZENS WHO HAVE ENDURED THE BIGGEST TRAVESTY EVER ON A SMALL TOWN.. 
 
 
WE WANT OUR SIDE TOLD. 
 
I CAN GIVE YOU NAMES AND NUMBERS OF PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS OUR MAYOR AND COUNCIL WHO ARE THE PROBLEM. SALLY PRICE, 45 YEAR RESIDENT, RETIRED POSTMASTER AND PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

Governor Bush,

I write this to voice my staunch opposition to the proposed relocation of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base Florida, or any portion thereof, to Edwards Air Force Base California. Eglin has time and again proven itself to be an eclectic collection of dedicated individuals that outperform all engaged in the fielding of tactical weaponry. To propose such a drastic fragmentation of an undeniably synergistic unit is in my view unconscionable. Now, in a time of war, it is ill advised to diminish our capacity to develop weapon systems that might save the lives of those so valiantly serving our county worldwide. Consequently, I urge you to vigorously resist this proposed change to the testing process.

I am retired Air Force NCO and a civilian contractor for the 46th Test Wing at Eglin AFB.  I have spent the better part of my Air Force career at Eglin and Hurlburt Field and have seen over the years how important the Test Wing is to our national defense.  I have been involved in armament testing while an Air Force Special Ops Aircrew Member and also as a civilian contractor.  The weapons that have been developed and tested here at Eglin have always performed well in wartime.  If the Test Wing was to move our nation would loose a great wealth of talent and experience in developing and testing armament.

Dear Governor Bush,

I live in Pasco County Florida, one of the hardest hit areas of Florida
with regards to Property Insurance rates.  I implore you to please call a
Special Session with Florida Law makers to deal with this problem.  We the
homeowners of this state will not be able to continue to own homes if the
insurance rates keep escalating.  When I bought my home in Land O' Lakes in
2001 my insurance premiums were about $800 per year.  Now it is $3,000 per
year,  and I was lucky to find an insurance company that would insure me
other than Citizens.  The insurance crisis in this state should be the most
important topic on the State's agenda and should be dealt with swiftly.  If
it is not, then I'm sure the voters of this state will have their say at
the next election poles.

P.S....One thing I would like to see legislated is to not allow insurance
companies to pick and choose what types of insurance the sell in our state.
If they sell property insurance in other states they should have to sell it
in Florida if they do business in Florida.

Respectfully,
Jerry LaBruno

Subject:	[*] Plea of clemency and release for Joshua

To the Honorable Governor Bush,
 
I am writing you in the hope you will see it in your heart and in the best interest of fairness and justice to reduce the sentence of Joshua Earl Phillips. I myself as well as all will admit the crime he committed was a terrible tragedy and should never have happened. However in the case of this young man, he admitted his crime and has been punished for it. Their is nobody on this earth that will convince me that a terrified 14 year old could make a rational decision when they fear the wrath of there parent as much as Joshua feared his father. It is the child that has no fear or respect for authority that we should fear. Not Joshua. I have worked with young men and women and found their fear of a mentally abusive parent is far worse in the vast majority of cases than physical abuse. This is something that after reading all that I can about the case does not seem to have been dealt with fully. Much of what I have read makes me wonder if the doctor's actually looked at his mental health issue to include depression or anxiety. I have seen the effects of these diseases on others and have suffered from both myself. Until I got help I would not know for sure why I did many of the things I did as a child or even remember some had taken place afterwards. If not for the Grace of God I am sure I would have been in a tragic situation like Joshua myself. It was other adults besides my parents that pointed them in the direction for me. If they had not I am sure I would have been behind bars long ago. I seemed like a nice young man to everyone except a few and they never had a clue how I actually was inside. Confused and scared to death of my father and his reaction to anything I would do wrong. With medication, the help of my wonderful wife and my belief in the Lord I have been able to live a happy normal life. I plead with you Governor Bush to please give this young man who has proven he is and can be productive and caring a chance at a life of freedom. Please do not allow this mistake in the justice system to go on simply because it happened before the Florida laws were amended. Joshua has proven himself worthy of a second chance more than most of the young kids that have been incarcerated for as or less heinous crimes and been released. I beg you in the name of all that is good and righteous to please look into your heart and see the injustice being done to what was a child at the time of his crime. I was living in West Palm Beach when this crime took place and followed the story closely as I have three children about Joshua's same age. I was horrified by it but after I read more I saw things in my own home I had not before. I have seen fear and terror in my children's eyes when I found out they had done something and I am not a mental abuser. Yet my children still feared me enough to try to cover things up as most children will. Add to that severe mental abuse and things escalate drastically for the worse. Two of my children are daughters and I have one son. They had the chance to out grow that fear of punishment by me. Joshua never had the chance to do that because he made a very serious mistake while to young to fully understand the repercussions and has been paying dearly for it since. He has lost his childhood not to mention his freedom because of one terrible moment in his life where he let terror and fear rule him at the cost of a young life. This does not make him into a monster or butcher as the prosecutor and media played him up to be. He was an immature terrified child in fear of his father's abusive wrath. Please try to understand this Governor. I have moved away since and thought that when Florida revised their laws about juvenile offenders that Joshua would have been released and placed on parole or at least his sentence greatly reduced for the good of justice. As was Lionel Tate's in West Palm Beach. Unlike Lionel though Joshua has taken pains to better himself and his environment as well while in prison. I was shocked to find out he is still behind bars now. Please reconsider his plight Governor so a mistake done in terror and fear by a child will not continue to destroy his family. Yes the prison system is to punish criminals but is this man really a criminal or just a terrified child as I feel he was at the time of Maddie's death. Many offenders have changed and improved themselves while in prison like Joshua has to be able to come out and be a good person and contribute to society. I am sure Joshua will be one of them if given a chance. I am so sure I would be willing to offer my own home for him to stay in and get on his feet with no misgivings at all. A person is judged by his actions. Joshua was before and placed in prison as an immature child. He did not even know how to express his feelings at that time. I'm sure he didn't understand all that was going on with his body and the changes he was going through simply because of his age. I know my son did not but I was there to help him not ridicule him if something happened he did not understand. Joshua has changed as we all do with time and deserves to be judged again as a man and released for his deeds and amends now. Maddie's own mother has issues about Joshua still being incarcerated as I am sure you are aware of. Maddie's sister still thinks back about Joshua at times with fond memories as well. I have read statements in the press from both of them to that effect.
 
I pray you find it in your heart to release this young man for the sake of justice itself, sir.
 
May the Lord bless you and your family. I would like to thank you and President Bush for your continued service to our country.

Dear Sir,

My name is Benjamin Aubin. I am 31 years old, married for 12 years and a 
father of two. I am writing you in an effort to obtain your help in a 
situation that has plagued me for over 12 years now.

In May of 1994 I was arrested for grand theft auto. I made no excuses for 
what I had done and bared full responsibility for the offense I had 
committed. Within days I was subsequently arrested and charged again for an 
additional count of grand theft auto. I must mention that this was not a 
circumstance where I had been charged and was released only to commit 
another crime but rather a situation where I was charged with the first 
offense and later charged with a second count. In any case, I served the 
sentenced imposed on me and was released early from probation with no other 
infractions. I then spent the next several years applying to the Marine 
Corps with the intent of leaving my employment in engineering to pursue a 
career in the military. Most individuals felt that this was not in my 
financial best interest, but I soon gained the respect of those around me 
when they discovered my intentions were not monetarily motivated. I have 
never directed my life towards monetary gain in fact I have always felt that 
as long as my bills were paid and my family secure I really needed nothing 
more then to pursue a dream as a Marine. For several years I pursued this 
only to be denied for what was perceived as a “dual-felony”. The ruling of 
dual-felony I understood and could sympathize with as obviously the Marine 
Corps was willing to forgive someone who had made a mistake and learned from 
it, but not willing to accept someone who was incapable of learning from 
their mistakes. I really felt as if I fell into the first part of this 
category, as this was actually one infraction, one moment in my life that I 
allowed a lapse in judgment to dictate the remainder of my life. Apparently, 
an error in the clerks of courts recording method listed the dates I was 
charged as my actual offense dates and thus it appeared as two separate 
offenses. Whether this was intentional or malicious in nature I don’t know 
and quite honestly don’t care. My time is now served and I have moved on 
with my life. Despite moving on though I have never really gotten over the 
need to serve and this was further complicated with the incident that 
occurred on September 11, 2001. Since that day I have made it a mission to 
serve in whatever capacity I could to aid those who are going off to 
protect. I have given my time to the US Army on two separate occasions to 
train troops in un-armed combat for those who are deploying to fight the war 
on terror. I have further solicited my time to any government, military or 
private security firm participating in the fight on terror free of charge. I 
can not emphasize enough the fact that I am willing to fly anywhere and do 
anything at my own expense to have the opportunity to serve. A few months 
ago it was suggested to me that I consider joining a private firm and be 
able to contribute in a more meaningful way as a security consultant and 
instructor in the middle east. Up until this time I had never really 
considered that option as I really didn’t know that much about it, but after 
doing some research I see that its not only possible but its very probable 
given me references and background. The problem lies in my prior offenses. 
As I stated above I was involved in two counts of grand theft auto and 
despite this being my one and only infraction outside of traffic related 
issues I was sentenced fairly harshly and adjudicated guilty. This 
adjudication of guilt has impeded me from having my record sealed or 
expunged allowing me to enroll in a career in one of these firms. I have 
followed all the guidelines of the clemency procedure but unfortunately have 
to sit on a waiting list for a period of another two years before my 
restoration of civil rights can be restored. My only other option is to 
apply for a full pardon. I applied for this last month and was informed that 
I was ineligible due to the fact that 10 years had not passed since I was 
released from probation in 1998. I read through the clemency procedures and 
found that this could be waived in certain cases. I am writing you to ask 
for just that. If there is anyway possible I humbly urge you to consider me 
for a full pardon and hear my case as soon as possible so that I may 
participate and due my part in this effort to combat terrorism. I can 
provide very strong character references ranging from high ranking military 
officers to police officers all of which have known me for many years and 
all of which know of my past infractions. All of my references have been 
informed of my early offenses, as I am unwilling to allow them to tarnish 
their reputations by being associated with a convicted felon. Despite this 
they are all willing to serve as character references for me. Please allow 
me to do my part and aid me in whatever way possible.

Sincerely,
Ben Aubin

Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Anna Liisa Covell and I reside in Hernando County, Florida.  I am currently a member of the Henando County Planning & Zoning Commission, the Hernando County Housing Authority Board.  In addition to my volunteer projects, I am the vice president and co-owner of A.L. Covell Electric, Inc.
 
I would like to recommend Roy Martin be chosen as the interim county commission for Hernando County to fill out the rest of the term vacated by Robert Schenck.   I served with Roy on our local EAR committee for the revisions on our current comprehensive plan and found his demeanor to be calm and reserved, but firm when necessary, to make decisions on the vital issues at hand. Mr. Martin also served on a 25 member committee to review the capital improvements necessary over the long term for Hernando County. Besides these two very important committees, Roy Martin is a member of the Hernando County Port Authority Board, the president of the Wellington Republican Club, and is also very active within his own Wellington community.
 
Roy Martin will be an excellent choice to help our county through the difficult decisions facing the county commission and  an asset to our community.

Jeb,
   It is my idea to call a special session for insurance for the following reasons:
 
                     If insurance companies requires 50% to 100% increase for the reason of paying for damage, then they should figure into the balance NOT paying for the damage this way:    1) After two years of a relativity normal season, refunding 25% of this increased revenue.  2) Based on a normal (average) two (2) year period, a figure should be designed to calculate the "Normal" or "Average" costs that are incurred for insurance companies. This would set the standards for my idea. 
 
 
       For instance: I paid $---   last year for insurance and was increased 50% next year, nothing happened for those two years and the insurance company calculated that it would.   They would be able to KEEP 25% of that increase for future devastations, I in return would benefit from the calm season that we had. ( A two 2 year turnover might be subject to change!  , make it 3 or 4 year, but the idea is there.)
 
                   The Insurance companies still gain 25% and the general public still believes they should stay in Florida instead of moving to be able to afford the increases in this needed insurance. Once the insurance companies collects this increase that has been approved, it will never be seen again unless this is passed into law.  
 
              Anotherwords
  I will forgive where my money went over the past 15 years, but I sure want to know where it is going for the next 15 years. 
 
I have a lot more on this subject that WILL work
It is all in a win win situation

Re:     Appointment of Louise B. Zeuli, Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida

Dear Governor Bush: 

I am writing this letter in support of Louise Zeuli for appointment as Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench as noted above.  I have known Louise for over 30 years and in that time I have come to appreciate her endless energy and commitment to her community and profession.  

I am a Masters prepared nurse with administrative experience in hospitals and home care.  Presently, I am Director of Education for Divine Savior Healthcare in Portage, Wisconsin.  However, I lived in Florida for over 25 years and I have an undergraduate degree from Florida State University and a graduate degree from Florida Atlantic University.  I attended college with Louise and I knew, early on, that her intelligence and sense of purpose and fairness would make a difference for many.  As a nurse, Ms. Zeuli has first hand knowledge of the meaning of pain, suffering and service.  Her leadership and education skills have helped others seeking a career in nursing as well.  Her knowledge of medicine combined with her practice of law and dedication to helping others makes her a superlative candidate for the Circuit Court Bench.

Her self-less giving to the community has included: Volie Williams’ Inns of Court, Program Chairperson, then President;  Board of Directors for Seminole County Legal Aid Society, Inc; Seminole Community College’s Community Advisory Board & Lecturer to their nursing students on legal liabilities; and Rotary Club of Seminole South (Board of Directors, Chairperson of Community Service II Committee, which reviews and allocates charitable donations from our club to worthy charities in the community).  In the past she has also helped to feed the homeless. Currently, through the Rotary Club, she is helping to build a Habitat for Humanity home.

Louise Zeuli’s personal attributes include honesty with a sense of “doing what is right” even in the most difficult of situations.  Her strong sense of ethics is her guide as she listens and responds.  Louise has proven herself to me over the past 30 years and I know that she would prove to be one of your career’s best appointment decisions.  I strongly urge you to consider Louise B. Zeuli for the next Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit, for Seminole County, Florida.  I know that she will not disappoint you.

Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am not a voter in your state, but find it very disturbing that you would endorse a man who was instrumental in the action to starve Terry Schiavo. You were so involved in trying to save this woman's life, that I find it surprising that you would now endorse a man who does not seem to share the same humanitarian moral values that you have. 
 
Please re-consider you decision to support this man. Please don't make a mockery of your eight years of core values and principles that you have followed during your tenure. 
 
If you already have given your endorsement, please consider recinding your endorsement. There are more important moral reasons for endorsing a candidate than for political gains.

Governor Bush, it has come to my attention that you may be preparing to issue an endorsement of  Senator Jim King in his pending senatorial race with Randall Terry.
 
The citizens of this State have had enough of Jim King's.  He is obviously a man who places more value on his half-empty bottle of wine than over the sanctity of life and the speak specifically of Terri Schiavo.  Those Republican voters in the State of Florida who oppose euthanasia, legalized homosexual marriages and the right of an unborn fetus to life, urge you to not  make this public endorsement of Jim King.  To do so would be a slap in the face to every pro-life, pro-family Republican residing in this great state.
 
Please reconsider this action.

If the Governor endorses Jim King instead of Randall Terry, none of the people in my parish will ever support him for any elected office he may desire to run for in the future.  This is the common opinion of virtually all the churchgoing people in our network, numbering in the thousands.  If the Governor supports a pro-abortion politician like King over a pro-life champion like Terry in a matter as insignificant as a state senate election, there is no reason for any pro-life voter to believe that the Governor will do anything worthwhile against abortion and, thus, we will NOT support him in any endeavor he undertakes.

    It has come to my intention that you intend to endorse State Senator Jim King in his bid for Florida senator to the U.S. Congress.  I strongly urge you to reconsider this move.  As I am sure you remember, State Senator King actually led the fight to kill Terri Schiavo.  This is the man who said:  "I want her [Terri Schiavo] to die".
 
    When I wrote to you in an attempt to persuade you to exercise your power as governor to save Terri Schiavo, I said then that you were meant for such a time as this.  Although you were found lacking in the fight to save Mrs. Schiavo from being murdered, please don't think that this potential endorsement isn't important, as well.
 
    Again, I strongly urge you NOT to endorse State Senator Jim King in his bid for national office.  It would be a betrayal of your support base, a betrayal of this great state and a betrayal of the citizens.

Governor Bush,
 
My name is Michael Moore and I'm writing to ask for a pardon for a case that happened in 1998. I was convicted, but with adjudication withheld, of lewd and lascivious, and thus placed on the sex offender registry. If my case is looked over it will show that I did not know the age of the victim, and also that the victim had lied about her age. 
In the time between the crime and now I have served in the United States Naval Reserves (a total of 12 years service in the Navy both active and reserves), and have even been sent to Kuwait with my former unit. I have done what was asked of me on probation (and in doing so receiving an early release), and continue to do so with the partial freedom that I have now. 
I ask for this pardon not only for my own sake, but for the sake of my wife and family as well.
 
My DOC# is J12744.
 
Thank your for your time.
 
Sincerely,
Michael Moore

Dear Governor Bush:
 
By way of introduction, I have been a Pensacola resident since 1971.  My husband, Captain Jack E. Davis, USN (now Deceased) commanded USS LEXINGTON from 1971-1973.  At that time, we cancelled our plan of retiring in California in favor of becoming Florida residents.  We have been registered Republicans since his retirement.
 
The purpose of this letter is to encourage you to give favorable consideration in the Appointment of my nephew, MICHAEL GOTSCHALL, as Circuit Judge in Seminole County.
 
I have had the pleasure of watching Michael's growth and maturity these many years.  He is a very intelligent, kind and caring individual with strong family, religious, and community service beliefs.  I know he will be an excellent Judge and well respected in his community.
 
I urge you to give Michael's Appointment first consideration.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush,

Attached is the resume' of Louise B. Zeuli, an applicant for appointment to
a circuit court seat, civil family division, in the 18th Judicial Circuit. I
met Louise when we began law school together in 1980. Throughout her career,
first as a nurse, and then as an attorney and family law mediator, she has
exhibited the qualities of energetic compassion and true caring for her
patients and clients that demonstrates her abilities to understand the needs
of people and how to solve their problems in an expeditious manner. Such
traits of insight and temperament are needed in our judiciary. I highly
recommend Louise Zeuli for this judicial appointment and appreciate your
careful review and consideration of her application.

Thank you for your time, and as always, keep up the good work. I truly
admire your innovative ideas and concepts and ability to make changes and
improvements in our great State.

Sincerely, Jim Wade
Sumter County

We firmly believe the State must do something to assist the citizens of Dade County to deal with the incompetence and corruption that exist in County Hall. This is an example –if Elections do not even know the boundaries where candidates can run for office and after making a mistake are shameless enough to ask the candidate to withdraw from the race we ask ourselves like Chespirito “y ahora quien podra defendernos?” (And now, who will defend us?)

Subject: Disqualification of candidate

 

In the month of June we learned that Community Council 15 was being reorganized after the incorporation of Cutler Ridge and therefore vacancies were available for qualified candidates. I personally called Lourdes Avalos of Team Metro to inquire about the subarea for Nilka Gomez’ address, but after speaking with Lourdes Avalos and Com. Sorenson’s aide Lourdes, we were told that Lourdes was on vacation. The person doing Lourdes Avalos’ work was George Gomez, with whom I spoke at length and who informed me that according to that address our subarea is 154.

 

Nilka prepared her documentation to run for a seat in subarea 154 and filed it on July 17, 2006. On July 18, 2006 Elections accepted her after paying a $100 filing fee. A campaign account was opened at BankUnited, flyers, cards and other propaganda material have been ordered and paid for. A few moments ago Nilka received a phone call from Lourdes Avalos stating that there had been a complaint filed against her because she is running in the wrong subarea and that because the deadline to file as a candidate has passed, she is being disqualified.

 

We have been informed that Commissioner Moss changed the district boundaries and apparently forgot to inform the corresponding County offices. We would believe this mistake happening in a Third World country but not in the USA. I would appreciate informing us:

 

1.	The name of the person that filed the complaint against Nilka Gomez
2.	Is the County going to reimburse Ms. Gomez her expenses made relying on the misinformation from George Gomez, as well as the Elections Department that should have had the change of boundaries by Com. Moss and should not have accepted Ms. Gomez’ application if there was an error in the subarea;
3.	Constantly changing District boundaries shows incompetence on the part of our elected officials, but the lack of coordination with the County departments in charge of giving out this information to the citizens is a poor reflection on the whole County government. If our bureaucrats cannot keep their data up to date and provide inaccurate and false information to us citizens, why do citizens have to suffer the consequences of this incompetence? 

 

We await your response with interest.

Dear Governor Bush: 
Please accept this letter as my enthusiastic endorsement of Janey Baldwin to fill out the remainder of Robert Schneck's term on the Hernando Board of County Commissioners. 
Janey's interest in the county is sustained and sincere. I met Janey in 2000 when I ran for and won a seat on the Board. Janey Lost (it was her second attempt). She ran another campaign in '04 and lost again, but Janey is not a woman who gives up. 
Janey spent hours in our office happily wading through the agenda legalese. 
Severall years ago, when the legislature was trying to rein in the City of Weekie Wachee, considring changes in their charter or revoking it, Janie stood up during "Citizen Comments"  and explained that if the charter was revoked the county would be responsible for their bills (mostly Attorney Joe Mason's hourly rate). 
Best luck to you, Governor, in the future. I voted for you; my first Republican vote since I helped elect Harry Truman.

Dear Governor Bush, First Lady or LT. Governor Jennings,

 

I don’t mean to take up your time, and am sure you have many issues to deal with, or tend to; 

Yet I would appreciate if I might get some help or guidance on a personal subject.

 

My name is Thomas M. Hodgson; I am a veteran of our fine nation, served 6 years Active duty, and 8 Reserves. 

And have fallen in love with a woman, whom, shall let us say, has a disturbing past to most.

 

I believe everyone deserves a second chance, we all make mistakes, and my problem is that my fiancé has a criminal background.

Her name is Christina D. Wester, she once had a problem with a few miscarriages, and got depressed, got into a bad situation with an ex-husband, turned to drugs and became addicted to cocaine. Her life turned for the worst, and was arrested for prostitution, drugs, and when was about to be killed by a drug dealer, and in fear of her life, got busted with a gun.

 

Now, I know that hurts her chance to do many things in society, but I am here to ask for her forgiveness.

 

She is currently a student at Saint Petersburg College, trying to obtain a degree in Tourism and Hospitality Management, she has overcome her weakness, and went thru Operation PAR, for rehabilitation prior to school, so has been drug free for over 3 years now.

She has been blessed with Professors, and staff members who look at her as hope, she has passed 3 semesters of an Honors program that is the “pride and joy” of SPC , a 9 credit hour class, that only is offered to students that deserve such. She has made the Presidents list, and has won numerous scholarships for women that have turned there lives around. She is a member of WOW (Women on the Way), a program just for women who need help back on there feet from such a past.

 

As a single mother, a felon, and trying to better her life, she is facing many obstacles in her pursuit to bettering her, and her son’s life.

She has experience in her field, yet one look into her “criminal” record; she is denied a chance to even prove herself.

 

As a concerned fiancé I am asking you Governor Bush or staff member, to please assist me in helping her further.

Is there any chance for her to receive a pardon, clemency, or anything that we together as citizens may do to perhaps give her a little help, or clean slate?

 

I will do what I can, but I need to know what may be done, please help me, not for me though, but for her and her 5 year old son.

I know she cannot go on in life as just a server in a restaurant, and barely make means. She is thriving to become a better person, and realized her mistake, and wants to step forward, but each time she does, is pushed back to a meaningless position.

 

Attached is an article in the local newspaper in her “come back” and her fight to keep alive……. http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/06/Floridian/On_her_way.shtml

In my previous e-mail, I forgot to inform you of the names of the people I spoke to.  The first person was Lory Wright, who took care of the problem in your office with the Public Service Commission.  She was suppose to find out yesterday and never called me back.  This morning, on my way to work, she called me back falsely accusing me of hanging up on her three times.  Someone who hangs up with someone else, doesn't call them back.  She should have called me yesterday with the information because she knew I was upset at the fact that I lost my 25 year marriage over Bellsouth soliciting a minor and non-owner of an account.  The second person I spoke to is Lory's supervisor, Mary Hamlee, also known as Bono or Bunny.  You should be disgusted with your state employees using taxpayers money to mistreat people.  What a difference between when you started and now when you're leaving.  We all had high respect for you, but now you choose to leave in such a despicable manner.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
         I'm writing to you in hopes of receiving a full pardon.
         This is the first time I have ever been in trouble with the law.
 I am on probation for five years, because I lived in a trailer that was in need of a lot of repairs.(not enough for the county to
condemn) Sad to say, I would have been better off to have been homeless. My children never had any health nor physical
problems because of where we lived. I never had a doctor report me due to my childrens health or physical needs.
          I live in Belleview,Fl. in Marion county.
          I should have gone to a jury trial, however I did not know enough about the law at the time.
          I've done two years of probation. I paid all of my fines, did community service, and took parenting classes. I also did
a drug class for DCF. I have always had a clean drug test. I moved into a better trailer, that I am buying.
          I was given felony child neglect- it was suppose to be with a possibility of early release (from probation) my lawyer
mumbled that part and it was never put in my paper work.
          I have two boys five and ten. This has truelly hurt them. I was a stay at home mom. I went to school functions.
          I would really appreciate being off of probation and getting this expunged from my record.
          I would like to have the right to vote back and to be able to attend school functions with my children.
          Please help me Governor Bush. A lot of good has come out of the bad. I have no regrets, other than, I want my 
rights back especially as they concern my children.
          I don't know what else to do to fix this mess. Thank you for your time.

Dear Ms. Jennings,
I am sorry to interrupt your busy day of activities.  However, this issue is so very important to our family.  Our son, John Darrell Rouse L37955, Holmes Work Camp, Bonifay, Fl., is serving a "minimum mandatory" sentence for brandishing a firearm in an attempted robbery at a Target (I believe) Store several years ago.
Briefly, with your workload in mind, I am hoping and praying that this case can be looked at by the Governor's office as a potential pardon.  This was John's first experience in such a heinous behavior and there were extenuating circumstances.  I was not at the trial proceedings, so am not fully aware of what transpired.  However, the newer law passed which covers robbery with a firearm exacerbated John's situation.  I am not aware of the previous sentencing for such a crime, perhaps it would have been "shorter" with condition for good time served etc.  However, now he is in for about 10 years and this is such a mental hardship on his family that I am hoping your office can offer a suggestion, even a pardon if appropriate.  I live in Utah with John's stepmother and desire to assist him and Florida in any way possible.  One suggestion, if he were released to my custody even with ankle devices or strict probation, he could again be a useful citizen.  He still has about 4-5 years left to serve after the 5 years or so that he has served.  I can not stress enough the concerns we have for our young man.  I truly hope that you can feel my sincerity that I am willing to do anything that would release John early, yet show the state and John that what he did was very terrible.  10 years is such a large portion of a person's life.  Please assist us.
Respectfully, Ed and Dixie Rouse

The last investigation that was supposedly conducted by the Office of Inspector General without my knowledge and involvement (February 26, 2002, OIG Project 01-134) was apparently initiated by Governor Bush’s office.  It inaccurately concluded the following:
1.       “…the complaint did not contain sufficient information to initiate a whistle-blower investigation”
2.       “…She also alleged that her needs and wishes were not considered when developing her Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE).
3.       “…Services, including medical, mental health, and training were provided.”
4.       “…In January 2001 Ms. McCabe was assigned to VRS Counselor Drusella Fowler.”
5.       “….the Advocacy Center for Persons With Disabilities…Ms. Fowler discontinued services without communicating with Ms. McCabe and a pharmacy bill went unpaid.”
6.       “No other instances of inappropriate behavior was identified.”
7.       “…VRS Supervisor at that time wrote a letter of apology to Ms. McCabe for Ms. Fowler’s actions and encouraged her to contact and work with the new Counselor.”
8.       “For a period of time she did, receiving mental health and training services.”
9.       “Medicaid is meeting Ms. McCabe’s medical needs, brought about by an unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide with rat poison (while in Maine).”
10.   “Although Ms. McCabe appears to be dissatisfied with the treatment Medicaid authorizes, VRS cannot provide alternative medical treatment as she requested instead of Medicaid.”
11.   “…Her demands for cash and benefits that cannot be provided by VRS have resulted in a series of complaints including the one received by the Governor.”
12.   …Mr. L.C. Fagen…ACP has investigated her complaints and a review of their file indicated that their correspondence to Ms. McCabe supports VRS’ attempts to provide the services necessary to return Ms. McCabe to employment.”
13.   “…VRS remains available to help Ms. McCabe achieve a goal of employment.”
14.   “…VRS is considering closing her case based on her unwillingness to work towards a realistic employment goal.”
15.   “…she appears to be unwilling to work towards the goal of employment identified in the IPE.”
 
In June 2002 after learning from a third party of the investigation, requesting and receiving a copy of the report to the Governor’s Chief Inspector General, I followed up by requesting a copy of the medical letters, correspondences, reports, documents from my DVR file, all documents that were received, reviewed, seen and used to come to the above 15 ruling in the 2/26/02 Report.  I was informed by Mr. Bill Geier that the information could not be made available to me and that all the IG’s office can provide is the report to the Governor’s Chief Inspector General.
 
As with CAP and OCR, I put forward the problems associated with the daily doctor’s office visits which regularly lasted several hours with some unbearable side effects.  The office visits went from approximately 3 days a MONTH, prior to November 2000, to 20 days a MONTH as of January 2002, a direct result of DVR, abruptly without written notice, discontinuing the medication goal in my mutually agreed to signed IPE and Amendment.  I was told by Mr. Geier that the IG office would not accept any corroborating documentation from me that challenges or contradicts the investigator’s statements in any way or that would attempt to change the outcome of the above statements to the Governor’s Chief Inspector General.  He also stated that the individual in the complaint is not contacted to explain, give evidence, dispute evidence provided by others to the IG investigator or in any way involved in the investigation process.
 
Again and again I've stated the reason my complaint has prolonged for so long is because investigations are completed by unknown individuals without my involvement, knowledge, input and when the report is challenged and the evidence is requested, I am denied access to it.  Had the IG’s office allowed me to be involved and challenge the investigator’s erroneous assumptions and conclusions above, I would have provided evidence to verify my claims.
 
I want to thank the Governor’s Inspector General Office for responding to my e-mails.  Of all the individuals I sent copies of my e-mails to Governor Bush, your office was the only one to care enough to respond.  However, I have not received any response or been contacted by Mr. Franco.  
 
The 2/26/02 IG Report remains factually incorrect without supporting written documented evidence to justify DVR's discontinuation of the mutually agreed to goal in my signed IPE of 10/6/99 and the Counselor's case notes on record of 10/18/99 and 11/12/99.

As you know our firm represents BP in the State.  Attached is a press release from this past June were the company pledged $500 million over the next ten years to establish a dedicated biosciences energy research laboratory attached to a major academic centre in the US or UK.  The University of Florida is one of several universities in the running.  Congressman Putnam has been the lead for the Congressional delegation in letters of support to both Lord Browne (Chief Executive) and the newly appointed BP America President, Bob Malone.  I have been told that you will be attending the National Governor’s Association meeting in Charleston, South Carolina on August 4-7.

Subject:	46th Test Wing at Eglin AFB

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Please take a few moments to consider the following points concerning the possible transfer of the 46th Test Wing of Eglin A FB to Edwards AFB, and then please do all in your power to prevent the transfer:
 
Air Force project officers have stated that there is nowhere better than Eglin to test.  I have heard of project officers stating something like, “We get maybe 80% data delivered in a week to ten days out west, but we get 100% here on usually the same day - - and the quality of the data is superb.  Some have left Eglin stating “If I have a say in this, we will never test out west again.”  I wonder if anyone has taken time to survey these clients.  I question the cost saving measure of taking jobs from someone whose performance record is stronger. 
 
Eglin is unique in that it has three points of entry for testing – land, the Gulf, and the Atlantic.  No other base can offer more than two.

 

Eglin’s armament mission is unique in that a weapon can be visualized, designed, prototyped, built, tested, and deployed all at one location.  No where else in the armed forces can an item be taken from cradle-to-the field at one place.
 
I wonder if our success would have been so great and swift in our initial attack of Iraq if Edward's had been responsible for weapon's testing.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Jo Harrison

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Gov. Bush:
     My name is Julie Stinnett and about seven years ago I got into 
trouble. I was charged and convicted of a felony.  I completed all of my 
sentencing and fines also rehabilitation.  I have changed my life around, 
got married to a wonderful man and I stay far from trouble.  I completed a 
CNA class at Chipola Junior College in Marianna, Fl.  After which when I 
tried to take the test they stated that I could not take the test, because 
I did not have my civil right back.  I did all the paper work needed to 
receive them back and still after multiple years have not received them.  
I now would probably have to take the class all over again and pay for it. 
 I have also tried to look into having my record erased or sealed.  I was 
told that no felon would ever have that done, but I am sorry I know first 
hand of people whom have gotten this done. This day and age you have to 
have a two income household to survive and with my unfortunate and 
childish past I am stopped from this happening .   I am a hard worker and 
great with computers, but of course all these type jobs will not hire me.  
I know that unfortunately I live in Marianna, Fl where there are few jobs, 
but this is where I live with my husband who has a decent job.  I need all 
the help I can get.  Whatever you can do or even advise I to do would be 
greatly appreciated.  I am hoping that you are the one to actually read 
this e-mail and it not just get disregarded as junk, for you are the one 
person that I know can make this miracle happen.  I thank you for your 
time and consideration. I hope to hear something from you about helping my 
situation. Sincerely, Julie Ann George Stinnett

Subject:	Pitbull - Request to Expedite Application for Restoration of Civil Rights

Dear Governor Bush:
 
It is my pleasure to write you on behalf of Armando C. Perez (born 01/15/81) professionally known as Pitbull.
 
Pitbull is a hip hop artist of Cuban American descent heralding from Miami.  His first album M.I.A.M.I. (Money Is A Major Issue) was certified gold by the RIAA and he is gearing up to release his second album "El Mariel."  He is trying to use the exposure that he will be receiving in promoting his next album to encourage kids to register to vote and to that end, will be working with an organization called Voto Latino. 
 
The problem is that because of a felony conviction that he received while a teenager for a non violent offense, his civil rights have been revoked.  He feels like a hypocrite delivering this message while not being able to go out and vote himself. 
 
I submitted a restoration of civil rights application to the Office of Executive Clemency, but they tell me that they are a year and half away from restoring his civil rights.  They advised me that the only way to expedite this process would be via a request from your office. 
 
As such, I respectfully request that you contact the Office of Executive Clemency and request that his application processing be expedited.  As I am sure you can appreciate, the positive youth outreach garnered by such an act will be worthwhile. 
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions and/or concerns.
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I’ve already written a letter concerning my husband’s candidacy for the vacancy in the 18th judicial circuit, but this morning I felt inspired to send you an additional note.  It might assist you to know that scarcely a day goes by that someone does not come to Mike or call him or help in some way and I am always amazed at the time and attention he gives each one of them.  His heart is sincere and caring and his insight and wisdom are extraordinary.  There are several attorneys who attend our church, but Mike is the one who folks come to when they have questions or need direction.  The reason is obvious; he honestly cares about people and wants to help.  I believe this is his main purpose for seeking a position on the court.  He sees a trend in the judiciary that concerns him and he is willing to commit his own life to serving others and making a difference.

 

It is my hope that you will have an opportunity to meet Mike personally when he travels to Tallahassee for the interview with your office.  If you could just get a chance to hear his thoughts and philosophy, I know you would be moved.  There are few folks of Mike’s caliber willing to pursue a position in the Court for reasons other than self-promotion, and I honestly believe that he is the best candidate of those currently nominated.

 

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts.  I pray that you will seriously consider Mike’s candidacy and appoint him to fill the vacancy so that the people of Seminole and Brevard counties can benefit from his commitment.  Should you have any more questions that I can address, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I believe that you will make a well-informed and solid choice and Mike and I are both grateful as citizens of this wonderful state for your dedication to Florida.

 

Yours very truly,

Subject:	Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Appointment

Governor Bush: 
I write to you relative to the appointment that is before you with regard to the Circuit Court vacancy in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit which vacancy relates to a Seminole County position on the bench. 

I have written you on behalf of four judicial candidates and you have appointed each one. Each time that I have written to you I have attempted to imagine that you are in the same room with the applicants and who you would find to be a person conforming to your values and who would make you proud to have appointed to the bench.

With regard to the appointment now before you, I did not plan on contacting you, but I have come to the conclusion that there is one applicant who would clearly meet your standards and make you very proud to have appointed. The person that I refer to is Ms. Louise B. Zeuli. In addition to having her Juris Doctorate degree, Ms. Zeuli  also holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Master of Science in Nursing. 

In terms of her law practice, she is an experienced trial attorney with significant, broad experience in general civil litigation, personal injury, medical malpractice/nursing homes, insurance law, guardianship/probate law, contracts, commercial law, civil rights, and employment law, but she is also a Certified Circuit Court Mediator, a qualified arbitrator, a trainer for County Court Mediators, and an arbitrator and trial consultant. Also, upon reviewing her history, however, you will observe a career stepped in service to others in the medical field. 

Indeed, you will note that she is very active in numerous organizations and, aside from professional activities and community involvement, she is a very spiritual and patriotic person who recently co-wrote an article entitled An American Legacy of Patriotic Prayers: Blessings of Liberty which will soon be published. And, in addition to her publishing activities, she is also an active lecturer on subjects ranging from mediation to the spiritual aspects of nursing.

Ms. Zeuli has a unique set of skills to offer the public as a judge, She has a value system of the nature that you are looking for in judges. She is a person who would make you proud to have appointed and who would further your legacy of appointing the best and most qualified person to the Florida judiciary.

Please reply ANYTIME to lngroot@stenstrom.com.  Also, please feel free to contact me at either the work telephone number set forth below or on my cell phone (386-748-3685) or at home (386-789-6235) ANYTIME.

Sir,

 

I sincerely appreciate your efforts to keep the 46 Test Wing at Eglin.  As a retired Air Force E-9, I’m personally offended by General Carlson’s underhanded scheming and arrogance toward those who will suffer the most.

 

I’m writing today to implore you to reject the idea of moving flight operations and munitions testing as suggested by General Carlson while at Eglin, July 21, 2006.  The same day, an upbeat, positive headline in the Northwest Florida Daily News announced, “Potential Test Wing Cuts Not as Bad as Feared”.  This is grossly inaccurate.  It is as “bad as feared” and terrible for Eglin’s future.  Moving flight operations and munitions testing will rip the very heart from the test wing since its mission is, to test weapons for the war fighter.  There won’t be much testing when the jets go away and munitions testing moves.  And, General Carlson’s failure to include the number of contractors affected by this proposed move is dishonest.  I feel he purposely downplayed the numbers because it might shock the community to learn contractors far outnumber the 700 military and civilians referenced in the Daily News.      

 

Munitions testing is the primary mission of the test wing.  Everything else is secondary.  Flight operations means test jets, test missions, shooting missiles and dropping bombs.  If the test wing aircraft leave, how long will the 53d Wing aircraft stay?  The 46 Test Wing and 53 Wing are collocated at Eglin to provide seamless testing from weapon inception to delivery to the war fighter. 

 

If munitions testing moves, 60+ years of infrastructure and the mission will die.  Other than a few secondary missions, not much happens on the range.  Range B-70 is the primary drop point and it’s busy.  Under this latest proposal, I assume Eglin will continue developing weapons then ship the items to one of the western ranges for testing.  That’s not smart.  

 

Sir, I’m a 30-year veteran and will support changes my country needs, even if it means leaving this area.  However, I cannot accept a major decision, affecting thousands of people, from a man who appears to have a personal agenda or vendetta against Eglin.  BRAC already said no.  What’s it going to take before they understand?  The Eglin ranges are a national resource and the loyal employees (and patriots) deserve better.

 

Thank you for your time.

Subject:	46th Test Wing Move

Mr. Bush,

 

            I am one of the 1500 contractors for the 46th test wing that stands to loose my job to a proposed cost savings cut for the Air Force.  I have worked for Eglin for 33 years and have seen the western test range try several times to close the test range on Eglin.  Talking with a number of testers that have been forced to use the facilities out west, they have reported long delays and inconsistent test results.  The infrastructure is not in place at Edwards at this time to take over the testing we currently do.  The expertise that you have on Eglin is the people employed by the contractors on Eglin which may not transfer to Edwards.  Don’t let it be overlooked that for the last 7 to 10 years there is data showing that the Eglin test range has actually shown a profit and paid the way for other resources on Eglin.  Eglin is also setup to support foreign nationals which in not allowed at other ranges.  Eglin is also the only base that has the water and land range capabilities.  Is it cost effective to move the test wing out west, only if the testing is no longer required?  It would be devastating to the local community and the Air Force stands to loose a valuable asset if the 46th Test Wing were to move and discontinue testing at Eglin.

Re:  The Nomination of Yvonne Colodny to the County Court of Miami-Dade County
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
    I am writing to express to you my highest recommendation for Yvonne Colodny who has been nominated to the County Court bench for Miami-Dade County.  
 
    I am a supervisor in the Miami-Dade Public Defender's office and it was in that position that I came to know Yvonne.  I first got to know Yvonne when I began supervising her several years ago.  I found her to be a tireless and zealous advocate for her clients.  Her case preparation and investigation skills are superb.  The quality of her arguments to the court and jury were unfailingly clear, insightful, and persuasive.  Over the years her legal skills have continued to grow to the point that she was promoted to the position of Training Attorney.
 
    In our office we have new lawyers entering the felony division on a regular basis.  It is crucial to their development that they be properly mentored and trained.  That is what a Training Attorney does.  Yvonne has excelled at that.  Since Yvonne trains some of the lawyers that I supervise I have seen firsthand the improvement in these lawyers after they have work closely with Yvonne.  Having once been a Training Attorney myself I know what it takes to do the job well. It requires a great deal of dedication and an equal amount of patience.  Yvonne seems to have a limitless supply of both qualities.  Those are the kind of qualities we need on the bench. Combine that with her legal acumen and demeanor, and you have the makings of a fine judge.  
 
    I have been with the Public Defender's office for the better part of 22 years and a member of the Bar for 28 years. I don't often write to governors to support judicial candidates but I felt compelled to let you know that choosing Yvonne would give the people of Miami-Dade County a terrific judge.  The people deserve no less.
 
    Thank you for considering my thoughts.
 
Very truly yours,
 
Stephen L. Kramer

Moving the 46th may save money for us the tax payer in yours eyes . But the real truth is it will effect the future of our country .I am not the most educated man but I work hard so my kids want have to worry about dealing with this problem by sending them to college . I know that there are grants and other ways to get an education . The real truth is that while getting that education one needs other cost taking care of that is not covered. These small but in time large cost is what I am referring to . With the job that I have with InDyne I can afford these cost but with it gone I can not .I not one of these people that would say that if the 46th leaves you will loose my vote , becauseI am still an American . But the truth is that I am a father and the children that I raise will feel the affect of this and will remember the results until it is time for them to vote .
 
In short if the wing does move please think of the ones that will really pay .

I am still feeling insecure about the proposed moving of the 46th Test Wing to Edwards AFB. I think that General Carlson is still trying to pull a fast one on Eglin. As a tax payer for this country I feel that this move will not accomplish anything, but cost the country and taxpayers more money. The General should provide the information to our community on the cost of moving to Edwards or the cost of leaving the Wing at Eglin. I feel that the number of job loses will be more than the General is telling us. Why has General Carlson never mentioned bringing Edwards to Eglin? By doing this would it save the taxpayers money also? I would like to also know what is meant by cutting 50% of the range capability, for which I am a part of. I am in a specialized field (High Speed Photography) and wonder what will happen to me and my co-workers if this is done. I guess I will be looking for a new job in another field (which I have no training for) in a different State or County. 
 
General Carlson made a statement to General Riemer “that you all are worrying about something you shouldn’t worry about at your level”. “I am not looking for ways to screw the people at Eglin, but there is going to be change”.  It sounds to me like General Carlson is going to screw the people at my level. I feel that General Carlson has insulted this Community by these words.
 
This action being taking by General Carlson goes against what the BRAC stands for also the law that it is. I realize that cuts must be made, but he is not looking for facts just people (taxpayers) that pay his salary, to buy so called new aircraft. Does he think that the cost of living, doing business, remodeling Edwards and the move will be cheaper that here. There will have to be new building built at Edwards to place the Test Wing. “Gee” where is the savings.   
 
I have been around Eglin AFB all my life and have supported it 100%, because I have worked their 28 (InDyne Inc.) years or have had family members work at Eglin since 1948 (before it became the Armament Test Center). Each employee at Eglin Test Wing has put their heart and soul into their jobs for all these years just to thrown out the door. I am very appalled!  If this move takes effect, this will hamper the support give by me and the community to the Military at Eglin. 
 
I hope that you will gather support from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and all of Florida, as well as other states to rally behind you.

Subject:	46th Test Wing/Eglin AFB

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing you in regards to Air Force Material Command’s shocking 
plan to reduce half of the 46th Test Wing’s capability and move selected 
units from Eglin AFB to Edwards AFB. As a patriotic and concerned 
citizen of the United States, and a supportive resident of Okaloosa 
county I am deeply concerned with stability of my county and moreover 
the security of the United States. I assume that you will receive many 
letters like mine and I will attempt to be concise and brief. I usually 
do not write my elected officials as I understand the pressures and time 
constraints that many in government service have levied upon them; but I 
cannot remain silent on this issue and I truly believe that this 
proposal will threaten the stability of Okaloosa county and the United 
States, cost the United States’ taxpayer more rather than save, and be 
in direct conflict with BRAC and the Office of Secretary of Defense’s 
plan to make Eglin AFB a Center of Excellence for weapons acquisition, 
testing, and sustainment.

First, Okaloosa county stands to lose the most out of this proposal. 
This county relies on the great jobs that the 46th Test Wing provides. 
Not only will the employees of Eglin suffer, but in a domino effect, 
everyone in this county will suffer. The Eglin Test and Training Complex 
provides a very unique environment to conduct developmental and 
operational test events. The resources that are available to the Joint 
test community is unmatched in the military arena. Plainly put: If you 
need to put a test weapon on a target, whether by air, sea, or land; you 
can do it at Eglin. A move to Edwards AFB will decrease realistic test 
environments therefore decrease the level of fidelity that is required 
for new and existing weapon systems. Just think of the news reports of 
collateral damage in any of our Area of Responsibilities if we failed to 
get it right during the test phase. By accepting a lower fidelity we 
weaken our nation. The only way I can think of to bring Edwards AFB up 
to speed with the present capabilities of Eglin AFB, is to commit 
millions, if not billions, of dollars to move and or construct 
facilities and purchase equipment.

The most confusing part of this proposal is that the comment was made 
that this move will save the Air Force money. I cannot begin to imagine 
the requirements that Edwards AFB will need to provide the level of 
fidelity that is required for the test and evaluation phase of the 
acquisition process. Historically Edwards AFB has been known for flight 
test, many famous and lethal aircraft have been proven in the Edwards 
AFB vicinity, however the infrastructure required for this process is 
not as large or demanding as it is for weapons testing. The Eglin range 
encompasses a land mass roughly two-thirds the size of the state of 
Rhode Island. This does not include the area of water that we have 
available for additional testing. To replicate this capability, I cannot 
envision the savings that Air Force Material Command states is in this 
proposal. In several new paper articles AFMC mentions many times that 
this will save the Ari Force millions of dollars, but they never explain 
how. This refusal from AFMC to be forthright with the information 
regarding how this plan will save money has fueled feelings from myself, 
as well as vast majority that work at Eglin AFB that AFMC is 
deliberately hiding something. All I can ask is for you to scrutinize 
the math and I would not be shocked in the least if the devil is in the 
details. I am not an expert in politics, but something is not right and 
I would highly recommend a Congressional inquiry to get the answers.

The third point I would like to make is regarding the Secretary of 
Defense’s plan to unify the Acquisition, Test and Evaluation, and 
sustainment efforts for weapons. Instead of using my own words, I will 
simply insert a document that was produced by the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense.

/SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JUSTIFICATION/

/ /

/Eglin is one of three core integrated weapons and armaments RDAT&E 
centers (with China Lake, CA, and Redstone Arsenal, AL) with high MV and 
the largest concentration of integrated technical facilities across all 
three functional areas./

/ /

/Eglin AFB has a full spectrum array of Weapons & Armaments (W&A) 
Research, Development & Acquisition, and Test & Evaluation (RDAT&E) 
capabilities. Accordingly, relocation of Hill AFB and DTRA NCR W&A 
capabilities will further complement and strengthen Eglin as a full 
spectrum W&A RDAT&E Center./

/ /

/The overall impact of this recommendation will be to: increase W&A life 
cycle and mission related synergies/integration; increase efficiency; 
reduce operational costs; retain the required diversity of test 
environments; and facilitate multiple uses of equipment, facilities, 
ranges, and people. Hill AFB and DTRA NCR technical facilities 
recommended for relocation have lower quantitative MV than Eglin AFB in 
all functional areas. This recommendation includes Research, D&A, and 
T&E conventional armament capabilities in the Air Force and DTRA/

/NCR. It consolidates armament activities within the Air Force and 
promotes jointness with DTRA NCR. It also enables technical synergy, and 
positions the DoD to exploit center-of-mass scientific, technical, and 
acquisition expertise within the RDAT&E community that currently resides 
as DoD specialty locations. This recommendation directly supports the 
Department's strategy for transformation by moving and consolidating 
smaller W&A efforts into high military value integrated centers, and by 
leveraging synergy among RD&A, and T&E activities. Capacity and military 
value data established that Eglin AFB is already a full-service, 
integrated W&A RDAT&E center. Relocation of W&A D&A In-Service 
Engineering (ISE) from Hill AFB to Eglin AFB will increase life cycle 
synergy and integration. ISE encompasses those engineering activities 
that provide for an "increase in capability" of a 
system/sub-system/component after Full Operational Capability has been 
declared. ISE activities mesh directly with on-going RDAT&E at Eglin 
AFB. Relocation of DTRA NCR W&A technical capabilities will increase 
life cycle synergy and integration at Eglin AFB. Conventional armament 
capabilities possessed by DTRA NCR directly complement on-going RDAT&E 
at Eglin AFB. Cost savings from the relocation of DTRA NCR to Eglin AFB 
will accrue largely through the elimination of the need for leased 
space, and by virtue of the fact that Eglin AFB can absorb the DTRA NCR 
(and Hill AFB) functions without the need for MILCON./

/COMMUNITY CONCERNS/

/ /

/There were no formal expressions from the community./

/ /

/COMMISSION FINDINGS /

/The Commission found merit in DoD's proposal to create a full-spectrum 
capability at Eglin for Weapons and Armaments, and found no reason to 
disagree with the Secretary's recommendation. The Commission carefully 
examined the justification for the Secretary's recommendation to 
transfer in-service engineering responsibilities for research, 
development and acquisition, test and evaluation from Hill Air Force 
Base to Eglin Air Force Base, and found it would enhance long-term 
military value./

/ /

/COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS/

/The Commission found the Secretary's recommendation consistent with the 
final selection criteria and the Force Structure/

/ /

/Plan. Therefore, the Commission approves the recommendation of the 
Secretary."/

/ /

This beg the question, how is OSD able to conduct its plan with only 
half of the current capability in weapons testing? In my opinion, AFMC 
has completely disregarded a recommendation by OSD that was signed into 
law by members of Congress.

The direction of AFMC is extremely disturbing to me as a concerned 
citizen. I truly hope that you and other elected officials are as 
concerned about this issue as myself. I truly hope that you can make a 
difference and set the course straight. I appreciate your time.

Subject:	Pontian Greek Genocide

Sir,

I am writing you from Izmir, Turkey.

My question relates to the Pontian Greek Genocide alleged to have
taken place, according to a number of Greek authors, between
1914-1922, although there are also Greek sources such as the
journalist Iakobos Pretenteris and historian Dr. Georgios Nakracas who
believe that nothing of a genocidal nature occurred. American
historian Mark Mazower also puts forth observations of a similar vein.
(http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n03/mazo01_.html)

I see that, in the wikipedia article on the Pontian Greek Genocide,
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontian_Greek_Genocide),
Florida is named as one of the U.S. states that have officially
recognized the historical existence of a genocide in this case.
Although, the reference shown for the recognition seems to consist of
a draft proposal by a senator.

I would like to ask if there is such recognition by the State of
Florida. The issue is sensitive through a number of viewpoints, and
would inevitably implicate, even when they are not specifically named
as in the proposal that is on the wikipedia page, the Turkish nation
as a whole. I do believe that genocide allegations are serious matters
and the presentation of this particular issue, as far as I could
judge, lacks the seriousness and the unanimity required. I could
extend my argument to cover wikipedia's coverage of the matter as
well, one "Turkish Prime Minister" named in their article, a "Safker
Pasha" has not been recorded by history, he simply never existed. The
Turkish Prime Minister in 1909 (that would be, the Ottoman Grand
Vizier) was not a Sefker Pasha. Creating fictitious prime ministers
for neighboring countries is not the best way for Greece to be taken
seriously.

Could your office please confirm me if there is a recognition by the
State of Florida or not?

Respectfully yours

To the Honorable Jeb Bush;

 

As an employee of InDyne, with 35 years of service to the 46th Test Wing on the Eglin O&M contract, I have to say that General Carlson’s announcement on Friday only increases my concerns.  Aside from air and armament testing, our contract doesn't do much else.  

 

What concerns me is that you may breathe a sigh of relief and think we are dodging a bullet.  However, what he announced was about (or perhaps a little more) than I would have expected in a total move scenario - do it in stages so the balance and flow of weapons development can be maintained.  Once things are in place at Edwards, I would fully expect them to be back in a few years to take the rest.  

 

Now is not the time to relax!  I see the fact this will go before Congress as a part of the budget process as a big plus.  However, members of Congress from California will be fighting just as hard to take our mission as I trust you will be fighting to save it.  I urge you to start to form a solid delegation of members now to join in this struggle.  BRAC praised Eglin’s test and development program.  One man should not be allowed to tear it down and move it within range of North Korean missiles at such a critical time in world events.

 

Respectfully,

 

Brannon M. Wilson

I have a suggestion for the states who have more illegals than they want.  When they are arrested and the INS tells you to let them go, let them go in a place they are wanted and will be loved and taken care of.  The democratic and republican politicians want them, so send them to Washington DC.  They will be in a far better place.  The INS can't tell you where to release the illegals, so send them where they are wanted.

Dear Governor,

There has been a lot of discussion the past few years about keeping an aircraft carrier at Mayport. Somewhere along the way, the homebases of our carriers caught my attention. We have 12 functioning aircraft carriers. They are based as follows:

 

Norfolk      5

Mayport      1

San Diego    4

Hawaii       1

Japan        1

 

I must stop and wonder if anyone in charge of our military has ever read a book on America's involvement in World War II. If so, you would think that they would know that you don't base all of your ships in one port. There is no good reason and lots of bad reasons to base 5 carriers at Norfolk and 4 in San Diego. Please encourage Florida's Congressional representatives to introduce a bill in Congress to require that no more than two of our aircraft carriers can be based in the same port. We have lots of ports where we could spread out our carriers as they should be spread out. Not only will this be better for our national defense, but Mayport may end up with two carriers.

 

Sincerely,

Kyle Billy

Governor Bush,

I am one of the 10 students selected to serve you as a
Gubernatorial Fellow for the 2006-2007 school year. I
am honored by the chance to work in Tallahassee and to
attend school at FSU. I met you briefly at the
Gubernatorial Fellow Reception at the mansion, and I
am so excited to be living close to the Capitol
building in the Fall.
I am writing you for a specific purpose, and I wish to
be very honest with you concerning my situation. I am
graduating from USF in August with dual degrees in
English Literature and Secondary English Education.
Previous to finding out about my acceptance to the
Fellowship, I had accepted teaching job in Tampa at a
middle school. I owe money in student loans, and I am
struggling to find the money to move to Tallahassee. I
know you are allocating $1,000 to each Fellow from the
generous endowment the program received. That money is
going to go toward my health insurance, as I just had
major reconstructive knee surgery in December and
minor surgery this last Tuesday. I cannot go to
Tallahassee uninsured. That said, I cannot make ends
meet by making $10/hr next year. Are there any
supplimental funds that may be available to me and my
situation? I want more than anything in the world to
be able to serve Florida in this program, but I cannot
do it as a graduating college student with laons to
pay and an apartment to furnish in the Fall. Right
now, I am considering taking the teaching job I was
offered because it would give me some sort of
financial security.
I would never send you an email like this to you
unless I had exhausted all of my other sources. I have
worked so hard for this opportunity and I want to make
sure I've done everything I could have to make it a
reality. Again, thank you for the chance for the
Fellowship experience. Even if I cannot become a
Fellow I am grateful for the opportunity you are
giving college students to learn about leadership and
public policy.

Sincerely,
Melissa Lilly

Subject:	[*] Movement of 46th TW to Edwards AFB

Sir,

    I read with great interest the words of Gen Carlton during his recent
visit to Eglin AFB.  There are several points in his speech that don’t add
up.
    First of all, if they remove the armament testing and the flight
operations and move that work to Edwards AFB, what is left of the 46th TW?
Without aircraft or the need to do armament testing the 46th then has no
mission.
    Second, his remark about “I don’t buy contractors, I buy contracts” is
cold-hearted and out of touch.  I work everyday with contractors, and they
are repeatedly told “one team, one fight”.  Am I now to understand that the
livelihood and welfare of the people who support our nation’s defense don’t
count?  I believe Gen Carlson’s comments are flawed and misleading, and that
his numbers of local jobs lost and transferred do not reflect the loss of
hundreds, if not thousands of contracted positions.
    Third, The general’s arrogance showed through on several answers to
questions during his meeting with local leaders.  His message was that it is
not the Air Force’s fault that jobs may be lost…it was because of the lack
of funding authorized by Congress.  His statement that  “our country is
waging a $318 million dollar a day war and that Congress is not providing
the supplemental funding needed to fight it” was clearly intended to take
the focus off of him and this move and divert it towards our legislators.
    I hope that you will continue to keep a close eye on any actions taken
in regards to the operation and mission at Eglin AFB.  I firmly believe that
the Air Force tried to slide this realignment under the radar, and outside
of the BRAC process.  It would not surprise me at all to see them try it
again.  MGen Riemer tried to tell everyone who was really listening that it
was his superiors that demanded secrecy and deception to try and move the
46th.
   Thank you for your continued support of our country, state, and the
people of this area.

Sincerely,

July 22, 2006

 

The Honorable Jeb Bush 
Office of the Governor 
The Capitol 
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

 

As a resident of North West Florida, I am very concerned about the latest talks of moving all or part of the 46 Test Wing (TW) to Edwards AFB, CA.  As I’m sure you already know, Eglin’s and the 46 TW’s missions have been studied, scrutinized and validated in both Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 1995 and BRAC 2005.  This latest proposed move to somehow circumvent the latest BRAC recommendations comes as a complete surprise and has many Eglin AFB employees and Florida residents very upset and concerned. 

 

Serving as the focal point for all Air Force conventional Weapon and Armament (W&A), Eglin AFB is responsible for the Research, Development, Acquisition, and Test & Evaluation (RDAT&E) of all air-delivered weapons. This is possible for three main reasons: The first being the synergies realized from the co-location of the Air Force Research Lab’s Munitions Directorate (Research), Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Weapon Systems Wings (Development/Acquisition), 46 TW (Development Test), and 53rd Wing (Operational Test) at Eglin AFB; the second being the irreplaceable, contiguous, and highly instrumented 724 sq miles of highly vegetated land ranges and over 120,000 sq miles of water ranges; and the third being state-of-the-art test facilities such as McKinley Climatic Laboratory, Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility, and the Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems.

 

Several BRAC 2005 recommendations have other geographically located W&A facilities realigning to Eglin AFB to further complement and strengthen Eglin as a full spectrum W&A RDAT&E Center. The impact of these BRAC recommendations will: increase W&A life cycle and mission related synergies/integration; increase efficiency; reduce operational costs; retain the required diversity of test environments; and facilitate multiple uses of equipment, facilities, ranges, and people.

 

As a resident of Florida and a taxpayer, it makes absolutely no sense to move all or part of the 46 TW to Edwards AFB. Even a partial move of only the flight test operations would greatly limit the ability of DoD to test weapons in the most challenging operational environments - vegetative/tropical environments. Also, it would have a significant impact on the synergies that currently exist at Eglin AFB starting with the elimination of the 53rd Wing’s ability to conduct Operational Testing and maintain its aircraft (shared w/46 TW).  If the truth be known it will cost the taxpayer a significant amount of money to establish only a subset of the capabilities that currently exist within the 46 TW at Eglin AFB with zero chance of every realizing a cost savings. Why is the Air Force trying to conduct its own mini-BRAC on Eglin AFB – It needs to stop now!

 

As governor of this state, I am asking for your help to ensure the entire 46 TW remains at Eglin AFB, FL to safeguard world class RDAT&E for future Air Armament Weapons, the livelihood of thousands of Florida residents, and the economy of Northwest Florida.

            Governor, finally, I am finishing assembly of a select group of younger generation Tallahasseeans who would be honored to meet with you, who care about the future of Tallahassee and are themselves increasingly powerful so that they can get something done.  They are ready to hear your candid assessment of Tallahassee (as both an academic and a government community); a forceful observation about why it can be substantially better for the benefit of all Floridians; and perhaps some words of encouragement.  They respect the unique perspective you bring.  It is an opportunity.  

 

            Does your schedule permit some kind of meeting anytime within the next two or three months?  

 

            We will, of course, guide around your schedule including flexibility to meet on relatively short notice and soon if that is better with your schedule.  (My wife, Karen, and I are considering hosting an informal event at our home for a maximum 25, but closer to 10, people).  Details, format and time of day, as you may desire, will be coordinated with whomever you may designate.  Thank you for your interest in this important subject).  

 

            We are not starting a new group but rather asking you to address substantial young leaders who will be able to effect change in Tallahassee.  Also, we are not providing for any kind of press release and are inviting no media but understand that your schedule is published and will conduct ourselves accordingly.

Governor,

    My law practice has become so intense that I have not taken the
time to complete my list of local "movers and shakers" for the meeting
we discussed by e-mail quite a long time ago on how to improve
Tallahassee as a capital and academic research host city.  I am
determined to gauge the commitment of each person who might be involved
so as not to waste your time.  

    There is substantial interest.  On the one hand it may be too
late but, on the other hand, the perspective you bring is what I want
the few people in town to hear.  

    However, I apologize that I have not done it yet.  

    The fact that you had been willing to meet with them, yet again,
after understandably frustrating earlier attempts, just adds to the many
reasons why I respect you, both for your candor and your willingness to
take another step.  
Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Hopefully you will have the time in the next few weeks to welcome the newly appointed Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Venice. His name is Monsignor Frank J. Dewane.
 
If you go the Diocese Web Site at www.dioceseofvenice.org you will be able to learn all about Monsignor Frank as he is coming to Florida from Rome. There is also phone numbers and addresses on this site.
 
I believe he'll be a great addition to all the citizenry of the State of Florida and may be someone you interface with in the future as his experiences are many in his short 18 years as a Catholic priest.
 
I am connected to Frank through his sister Mary Dewane, who is married to my brother Joe Anderson here in Phoenix, AZ.
 
Thank for you time and attention to this matter.
 
May God continue to bless you and your family as you carry on your public service.
 
Sincerely

SUPPORT OF 46TH TEST WING

 

After attending a community meeting with General Bruce Carlson and Major General Jeffrey Riemer it appears there are several options under consideration to address the $1.7 billion budget reduction to the Air Force.  As a result of a recent directive the Air Force has been charged with the responsibility of proposing suggested options on how to be more efficient.  The potential move of the 46th Test Wing is just one of the options on the table.  

 

Therefore, we are encouraging our community leaders to write to their congressional delegation in support of maintaining the 46th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base.  Although, we recognize that change is inevitable and that the Air Force faces significant challenges it is our desire that they propose an option that does not remove the 46th Test Wing at its full capacity.  

 

Budget submissions will be presented by August 15th that will include the Air Force’s suggested reductions.  It will eventually make its way to Capital Hill for Congress to have any final decisions.  

 

Our congressman need to hear from you about the importance of retaining the Air Armament Center including the integrated capabilities of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, to provide consolidated focus on weapons development and test evaluation.

I understand that developers got the "go-ahead" from the Govenor's office to allow Port Orange to take a sizable chunk of New Smyrna and build thousands of homes, a mall that is larger than the Daytona Mall and widen the road that runs through our residential community to 4 lanes.  There is also a nature preserve involved in all this.  I would like to know how you could allow this to happen without any knowledge of the Turnbull Bay area.  I can only think that there is a big money pay-off to someone, or Port Orange officials lied through their teeth because of the smell of big money from tax revenues from the project.  I understand that there is a new interchange being planned off I-95.  There already is one for Port Orange and one for New Smyrna.  I have never seen people so riled up.  I also understand this was to be voted on in Sept. and now it is a hurry up deal in July.
We live in a city that wishes to remain a charming place to visit.  In fact that has been our draw for "snow-birds" and visitors.  We don't want to become a commercial venture to line someone's pockets, ESPECIALLY not even from our own community, and losing part of the land within our boundaries.
I speak for the residents of Turnbull Bay when I say we will cry for the beauty of our area if this is allowed to happen, and will fight with all our might to see that it doesn't.
Residents went to the Port Orange City Council this last Tues and were not allowed to speak.  So much for democracy in action.  I understand we were given 2 weeks to try and do something about it.  That isn't much.  I am begging you to put a hold on whatever action you took for the project until you look at our beautiful Bay and see how running a highway through it would destroy it.  Allow the people it would impact to have a say in it.  This area has some lovely homes and their value would plummet.  How would you react to a 4 lane road going in front of your home?  I had a notion that you might be an honest politician, but I'm not sure that animal exists anymore. This is all about money.  who is getting it I'm not sure.  I would like more time to get a petition going.
I'm not even sure what the politics of our boundaries are, as part  of the land is in new Smyrna not Port Orange.  At least not yet.  As far as I know we have not ceded the land  to them.
Again, I plead with you to at least put a hold on this transaction for more than 2 weeks until we can try and fend off the horrible travesty.
I thank you for your ear and anxiously await some action from your office.
 
 
Respectfully,
Virginia Baker, a Turnbull Bay resident

Good morning Governor Bush,

Last year Navy Child and Youth Programs’ annual CYP Professionals conference was held in Orlando, FL. and because we had such a great time, we’ve decide to visit Orlando again this year.  This year’s conference will be held November 27th through December 1st, , 2007 and there will be approximately 250 Navy Child and Youth Program Professionals attending from Navy programs world wide.  

I’m sure that you are aware of the importance of Child and Youth Programs to our military families.  Our military families rely on the kind of quality Child Development, School Age and Youth programming we provide for their children so that they can accomplish their mission as military members whether it is on board the installation or as a war fighter overseas. Knowing that their children are cared for in a safe and caring environment and are provided quality programming helps them meet their mission. Our annual conference brings Navy Child and Youth Professionals together each year for essential training seminars, networking and round table talks to keep us abreast of the latest information and innovations in the Child and Youth field and to provide us with the tools needed to continue providing the highest quality programs possible for our military families.

Because of your continuing support of our Nation’s military members and their families and your father, President George Bush was a decorated Navy pilot, we are hoping you will accept an invitation to be our Keynote speaker at this year’s conference.  The first day of the conference is November 27; however, if this date does not fit into your calendar, we would be delighted to accommodate you at anytime during the conference.

Since this is an informal request via e-mail, please let me know of any formal procedures required to request your attendance at our conference.  I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Very Respectfully,

Sallie Bullard

Subject:	Troy McPeak's case/plea for Governor Bush's appointment of a special prosecutor
Attachments:	Dear Governor Bush.doc; From killers Defense ATT to D.A.doc; Richie Troy 5 months before Slaughter.jpg; Pool of blood My Baby Brother Troy.jpg; Butchered Troy.jpg

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My name is Matthew Stephenson-Smith.  Richard "Richie" McPeak and I have been friends since childhood.  Through my friendship with Richie I also became acquainted with his younger brother Troy.  You have recently learned of Troy's horrific murder 10 years ago in Tampa, Florida and the subsequent mishandling/abandonment of the cases against the 3 other participants in the slaying.  Below is an excerpt from the e-mail that Richie disseminated to friends and all government and law enforcement contacts he thought might respond to his plea for justice for Troy: 


On Monday, July 31st I will place flowers where Troy's blood once flowed and then embark on a 300 mile journey by walking from the site of my Brother's murder in Tampa to the state Capital. I will not eat or drink on the journey. Though I may suffer it pales in comparison to Troy's last twenty mintues of life. 
 
I do this not as a zealot, but with the faith that some people must be made to face justice. This walk is for Troy and every victim and family member who has lost someone whom they loved as much I did my baby Brother Troy.
 
At the end of my journey it will be August 4th, Troy's 35th birthday.

I am greatly concerned for Richie's health and safety during his planned walk.  I believe that the only thing that might persuade Richie to forgo this walk is the appointment of a special prosecutor by you.  You are the only person in the state of Florida who has this power, and I am begging you to exercise it before July 31, 2006 for Richie's sake as well as for justice for Troy and protection of all the citizens/residents of the state of Florida.
 
My initial concern is for Richie's safety when he returns to the park in Tampa where Troy was murdered to begin his walk.  If the residents of this area including family and friends of the four participants in Troy's murder learn of Richie's plan I shudder to think of how dangerous and volatile the situation would likely become.  Richie would require a police escort and possibly a media presence with cameras to assure his protection.  This area in Tampa is as "bad" as any dangerous area in any major city in the United States.  Richie's presence at the park there, although fitting, well-intentioned, and noble would be highly conspicuous and likely garner the worst kind of attention from the residents.    
 
Richie is one of the most mentally and physically tough individuals I know.  He truly believes he can will himself to complete this 236-mile walk in 5 days with no food or water.  I am the greenhouse/safety manager at an agricultural research and development facility in Immokalee, Florida.  Heat-related illness and heat stroke prevention is a major focus of my safety training program, so I am acutely aware of the physical jeopardy Richie will face while attempting to make this walk without drinking any water.  I believe absolutely that Richie has the strenght of will and committment to begin this walk, but I am afraid he will physically be unable to finish if he collapses from a heat stroke and winds-up in a hospital along his route.  I do not know what the evaluative process is in the appointment of a special prosecutor or how long the process may take, but if there is any way you can expedite your decision please do so now.  
 
It is terribly obvious to me that there has been a blatant miscarriage of justice with Troy's case.  I believe anyone with a modicum of intelligence will easily reach the same conclusion if given the opportunity to learn the details of Troy's murder.  Richie has recently acquired crime scene photos and has reviewed the police report of the initial investigation.  After 10 years Richie and his family are reliving the nightmare of Troy's murder yet again.  The propensity of evidence against the other three participants in the murder is overwhelming, and it is also clear that there are several other individuals guilty of obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and at the very least depraved indifference.  Charges should have been brought against the other three participants (I am loathe to refer to them as "men") in Troy's murder, and Richie and anyone else who learns the details of this case knows this to be true.  Tampa law enforcement botched the investigation and inexplicably allowed the cases against these other three participants to become stagnant and inactive.  I am more that confident that a special prosecutor will have all of the evidence and sworn statements necessary to bring charges against them.  This may be a gross over-simplification, but all you have to do is make this appointment.
 
I believe anyone can find some way to relate to Troy McPeak and his brother Richie, especially anyone who is a parent and/or a sibling.  The horror of Troy's murder and the plight of Richie and his family in the aftermath should move us all.  I have no doubt that the crime scene and autopsy photos and details of Troy's murder caused you to have a reaction like they have all who have seen them.  Out of desperation Richie felt compelled to shock everyone into attention and hopefully action.  In the most basic concept of right and wrong what these individuals did to Troy was the most grievous wrong, and they all deserve to be held accountable and punished.  It seems so simple, but the reality is that law enforcement and the justice system in our society in the state of Florida has failed 75% (only 1:4 of the participants in his murder convicted) on behalf of Troy McPeak and his family.  Richie has been engulfed in the beaurocratic quagmire of the Florida judicial system on all levels until your office finally responded after 10 years.  This case has now become a matter of politics, and Richie and his family are now relying on you, arguably the most powerful elected official and politician in the state of Florida, to champion their cause.  They need a champion who is willing to wield the law like a sword rather than a shield within Florida's political and judicial systems.
 
Please, if there is any way possible to expedite your appointment of a special prosecutor before July 31, 2006, do so to prevent my friend Richie from undertaking such a dangerous mission.  The appointment of a special prosecutor should make it unecessary for Richie to take such drastic, desperate measures to bring adequate attention to Troy's case.  Richie and his family are still struggling to cope and live on after Troy's murder, and I know their spirits will not survive if something tragic befalls Richie on his quest to achieve justice for Troy.  Please help my friend Richie and his family.  Thank you for your time and attention to my message.
 
Sincerely,
Matthew Stephenson-Smith

            Governor, finally, I am finishing assembly of a select group of younger generation Tallahasseeans who would be honored to meet with you, who care about the future of Tallahassee and are themselves increasingly powerful so that they can get something done.  They are ready to hear your candid assessment of Tallahassee (as both an academic and a government community); a forceful observation about why it can be substantially better for the benefit of all Floridians; and perhaps some words of encouragement.  They respect the unique perspective you bring.  It is an opportunity.  

 

            Does your schedule permit some kind of meeting anytime within the next two or three months?  

 

            We will, of course, guide around your schedule including flexibility to meet on relatively short notice and soon if that is better with your schedule.  (My wife, Karen, and I are considering hosting an informal event at our home for a maximum 25, but closer to 10, people).  Details, format and time of day, as you may desire, will be coordinated with whomever you may designate.  Thank you for your interest in this important subject).  

 

            We are not starting a new group but rather asking you to address substantial young leaders who will be able to effect change in Tallahassee.  Also, we are not providing for any kind of press release and are inviting no media but understand that your schedule is published and will conduct ourselves accordingly.

Governor,

    My law practice has become so intense that I have not taken the
time to complete my list of local "movers and shakers" for the meeting
we discussed by e-mail quite a long time ago on how to improve
Tallahassee as a capital and academic research host city.  I am
determined to gauge the commitment of each person who might be involved
so as not to waste your time.  

    There is substantial interest.  On the one hand it may be too
late but, on the other hand, the perspective you bring is what I want
the few people in town to hear.  

    However, I apologize that I have not done it yet.  

    The fact that you had been willing to meet with them, yet again,
after understandably frustrating earlier attempts, just adds to the many
reasons why I respect you, both for your candor and your willingness to
take another step.  
Respectfully,

Border fence cited as deterrent to crime

Complete article at: http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060720-105104-9512r.htm

    Building fences along high-traffic areas of the U.S. border with Mexico dramatically reduces crime, the president of the Border Patrol union told Congress yesterday. 

    "Drug smuggling was rampant" in the border area just south of San Diego, said T.J. Bonner, national president of the National Border Patrol Council, before a fence was constructed. "Anarchy reigned, and there was no semblance of control over that section of the border." 

    Mr. Bonner said that after the fence was built, with surplus military steel landing mats, drug seizures tapered off and the crime rate fell sharply. 

Reader comment:
We need to secure our borders, build fences, eliminate benefits and punish employers who hire illegal aliens. Drying up the benefits and job market would encourage many illegal aliens to return to their country of origin. A program to give citizens a reward for reporting employers who hire illegal aliens would speed up reverse migration. The IRS has a similar program that allows citizens to receive a reward for reporting tax cheats.

Pls pass along.

Subject:	Are you committed to civil rights or are you a criminal?

Dear Govenor Bush:
 
Your brother's assertion during his appearance at the NAACP convention  of his "family committed to civil rights" reminded me that in July 2004, the US Civil Right Commission voted to open a civil and criminal investigation of your administration for knowingly renewing a racially-biased scrub of voter rolls.  The reports I remember stated that you personally ordered this new purge of "felons" from the voter rolls.  This scrub may have also violated a settlement agreement you signed with the NAACP.
 
The Commission turned that case over to the Justice Department, run by your brother's personal counsel, two years ago, yet no investigation has begun.  Your brother then promptly replaced everyone on the Commission that voted to investigate you.
 
Is this a cover up?  Have you been contacted by the Justice Department in regard to this matter?  Do you think that the people of Florida will just "forget".  How do you think this will play with the public in any future candidacy you may pursue?
 
I would like to know.  My next email is to the Justice Department.
 
I look forward to your response.

Blessings from Sarasota, 
 
    I have received countless calls and emails. As you very well know the issue of illegal and the astronomical cost to the taxpayer of Florida is a reality ! (4.3 Billion) a year to our state?????? I understand that immigrants-united-for-freedom : Immigrants United For Freedom will be trying to force you to help them in maintaining law breakers in Florida. Who benefit? The lawyers and chambers of commerce representing large corporation who are using the illegal as a new force of slaves. I am sending you this information prior of you meeting with them. 
Licenses are a privilege and not a right, everyone needs a background check up, finger printed and family status.
We Hispanic-Americans are opposed to grant any special privilege to illegal. I stand with the ordnance or Avon Park mayor Tomas McClan city manager C.B. Shirly, it is time to stand for the truth. Dios le bendiga.
 
According to the Los Angeles Times,                                                                       How many in Florida?

1. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.                                                       How many in Florida?

2. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.                                             How many in Florida?

3. Over 66% of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans                                         How many in Florida?

on Medi-Cal whose births were paid for by taxpayers. 

4. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally.            How many in Florida?

5. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.                                            How many in Florida?

6. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens                        How many in Florida?
 from south of the border.   
7. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.                                                              How many in Florida?


 
Our Hispanic-American children future is in geoperdy!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am sending this note in regards to the appointment of Louise Zeuli, Esquire to the Circuit in the 18th Judicial in and for Seminole County.  It is not often that one has an opportunity to appointment a person with not only the ability, education and experience, but one with character beyond reproach.  Louise is the type of person we need on the bench!  I highly recommend Louise and encourage you to take this rare opportunity to place one with integrity in a seat of power.
 
Governor Bush, you know who I am and that I would not recommend a person who does not have the high standards that I myself live by.  As you know, I resigned from the Seminole County Executive Committee based on integrity,as a die heart Republican I am taking a bold stand, "an appointment for Louise" will be a moment to remember for the rest of your life!
 
 
Respectfully,
 
Ruby Homayssi, LCDR,USN, Ret.

Please help fight the Air Force plan to shutdown the 46 Test Wing at Eglin AFB. I am a civilian employee in the 46 Test Wing.

All indications are that a decision has been made by AFMC to follow through with the shutdown despite the official word that no decision has been made.

The functions of the 46th test wing are crucial to our national defense and the ranges at Eglin are ideal for testing. This has already been dealt with during BRAC investigations.

Thank You.

Honorable Governor Bush,
I want to thank you for the outstanding job you have done as Governor of Florida.
You have probably already heard about the proposal to move the 46th Test Wing from Eglin AFB to Edwards AFB. This would be an economic disaster to Northwest Florida. All the way from Port St. Joe to Pensacola.This move would effect thousands of men and women in the military and contractor employees along with Civil Service employees in Northwest Florida. Even the State of  Alabama would feel the loss.
I would appreciate if you could do anything in your position to help keep the 46th Test Wing at Eglin. It's role is vital for training, testing and defense of our nation.

As the decision on the fate of the 46th Test Wing draws near, I am asking that you re-double your efforts to keep it at Eglin.  Since I last wrote, war has broken out in Israel and threatens to spread.  Now is NOT the time to disrupt the flow of weapons development.

 

Now is also not the time to be misled by what we all feel is inaccurate cost savings data regarding the relocation of the wing.  Even personnel numbers are extremely skewed.  The elements in the Air Force that want to move the wing talk about a huge increase in people moving to our area due to BRAC, with a much smaller number assigned to job losses if the Test Wing is moved.  When it comes to gains, they speak of total people, with spouses, children, and all other dependents counted, but when they talk loss, they quote jobs only, and not dependents.  This makes it appear the losses are more than offset by the gains, which is NOT TRUE!

 

Please fight to keep our good paying jobs in place, and don’t be misled by inaccurate data.  I have a disabled wife that depends on me working in a good job, with good health benefits.  PLEASE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR US!

I am writing this letter to ask for a favor.  I would like to know if 
there is anyway that I might be able to get 3 VIP shuttle launch viewing 
tickets to the upcoming launch of Atlantis on August 28, 2006.  One of my 
roommates just lost his father to a major heart attack.  I would like to 
do something nice for him and I know that he has been trying to see a 
Shuttle Launch since we moved to Florida.  We tried to get tickets, but 
that failed since they sold out in 2 minutes.  I have been an avid Shuttle 
enthusiast since the first Shuttle Columbia went up.  I have tried to get 
to Shuttle Launches in the past and have had little success.  I was able 
to attend the last launch of Discovery on July 4th, but my roommates were 
not able to attend with me.  Any help that you might be able to give to me 
in my quest would be greatly appreciated.  It has been a rough year for us 
and I know that this would bring some needed relief to us.  This would be 
something special that we could all enjoy together.   I want to thank you 
in advance for your time and attention to this request.

850/651-1550
 
          
Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am making an urgent plea to you to help preserve what is part of a one-hundred-mile stretch of sugar-like sand that extends from Pensacola,FL, to Panama City, FL. The land I'm referring to is known as Okaloosa Island. It is arguably one of the most beautiful parts of this country, if not the world. If you have never visited our beaches, my husband Bill and I would love to have you as our guest so you may see for yourself!
 
Okaloosa Island is a barrier island, which separates the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. It is between the Brooks Bridge and the Destin Bridge. It is part of the Eglin Air Force Base reservation. State Highway 98 is located on Okaloosa Island, connecting these two bridges.
 
 Due to numerous repairs to this highway from inevitable hurricane damage, the sand, naturally deposited by quartz runoff from a river east of this area, is being continuously degraded.  Countless dumploads of inferior sand and rock cover up this pure, white sand when hurricane winds and water relocate them.
 
I'm a native of this area. After twenty years in the Air Force, my husband and I returned here eleven years ago. Its beaches have always been my favorite sight on earth. This stretch of sand is loved by many, including our area's military personnel. It is a source of recreation and rejuvenation, used by the public as well. As the sand of Okaloosa Island continues to be degraded, it has become obvious that no one locally has the will or the clout to solve this problem. The solution is to relocate the highway or raise it, like a causeway. My dream is to have Okaloosa Island designated a national treasure so that it will forever be preserved in its pristine state.
 
Recent rumors and circulating, which if true, would no doubt result in further deterioration of this parcel. It appears that the very existence of Eglin Air Force Base is at stake. The rumor is that the 46th Test Wing is moving to Edwards AFB in CA. The consequences are numerous. A logical conclusion is that the entire base would eventually close. What I fear most is that this most desirable piece of the Eglin reservation would then be sold to developers. They have already tried to entice Eglin to relase part of this parcel. Also, because long-range testing over the gulf would be halted, oil drillers would probably be allowed to explore this presently off-limits territory. An oil spill would be devastating, and more than I could bear.
 
Eglin is one of the most coveted assignments among its soldiers, in no small part due to our beaches. Just ask anyone who has been assigned her. Or ask the retirees who have returned.
 
First, please use your influence to preserve this beach. And please fight for the 46th Test Wing. Consider the morale of the men and women who are serving this nation, and the value of this location to them in intangible terms.
 
With warmest regards,
 
Nancy Frey

The Honorable “Jeb” Bush
Governor
PL05 The Capital
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0001


Dear Mr.  Bush,

The purpose of this correspondence is to respectfully request an audience with a member of your staff. My former supervisor, Mr.  Robert Crouch, and I were whistle-blowers at the Public Service Commission back in 2001.  We were both dismissed in retribution for these actions.  While we have each attempted to repair the damage done to our respective careers and reputations utilizing the judicial system, I am writing this much overdue letter because I wish to find an alternative method of resolving my matter.  I  sense that you are presently concerned with your legacy of leaving Florida a better place.  Indeed you have made many remarkable and lasting changes to the agencies under your leadership. I am also aware of your steps to alter the composition of the Public Service Commission.  However, I remain concerned about a portion of the organization that has lost sight of the agency’s mission and ethical constructs, and is placing personal agendas above service to both the citizens of
 Florida and its regulated utilities.

 My family members and I are steadfast Republicans who have supported you, your brother and your father.  My very own grandfather  was instrumental in bringing the republican party to Florida.  While I have never been interested in politics myself, many in my family are quite politically active including my late father who was mayor of Quincy for two terms.  Some of my cousins have served at high levels in the Martinez administration.  My uncle, Randolf Thrower, was the Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon and a cousin, the late President of the Senate, Pat Thomas, was the lone Democrat of our large Gadsden County clan. (We forgave him of course because he worked so tirelessly on behalf of Florida even when he was sick with cancer.)  Like the Bushes, we Munroes were raised to view public service as an honorable means of giving back to a country that has blessed us so richly.  Regardless of the personal repercussions, I  was brought up to always do the right thing.  I bel
ieve I did just that and was then punished for doing so. 

Just like your brother George, I gave up alcohol some twenty plus years ago and dedicated myself to giving back to my community. I returned to school and earned a degree in electrical engineering  despite being dyslexic.  When I graduated, I immediately sought out public service.  I worked hard, received favorable evaluations and was promoted three times in the course of eight years.  The former executive director, Mr.  Talbot, acknowledged my problem solving skills when he awarded me the agency’s very first “mug” for outstanding service.  Additionally,  I received seven commendations from the public, two with Commission notations.

Just a few short months after the whistle-blowing, certain managers began harassing me and papering my personnel file.  They used my disabilities against me and never provided the accommodations I requested.  First, Mr. Crouch was forced out, then Mr. Talbot, and finally I was fired.  Good people who tried to assist me were demoted.  My reputation both professionally and personally has been maligned.  I have suffered a stroke, depression and post traumatic stress in addition to enormous financial loss. 
 
Mr.  Bush, I have not ever  invoked my family’s name, wealth or political standing in the past, but the seriousness of my own circumstances coupled with a genuine concern for the future of the Commission  compels me to do so now. I would very much like to continue my career in the public sector and am confident that I can make a meaningful contribution with another State agency.  My lawyer is convinced that we will prevail in court but it needn’t come to that.  I am simply asking you to have a staff member meet with Mr. Crouch and myself to hear our concerns.  If you find our story compelling, you could then direct the State’s lawyer, Mr.  Jason Taylor, to settle the case.  Following the latest round of negotiations, I was under the impression that he would like reach a settlement but may be prevented from doing so by a finance officer. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and in case you haven’t been told recently, thank you for your service to the State of Florida.  Should you wish to contact me, I can be reached at either 402-2095 or 321-4779.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Fw: Illegal Immigrant Facts

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I received the message below from a friend.  Even though it's an internet letter, I believe there is much truth to it and most states have experienced problems similar to California's.
 
We all know how serious our immigration problem has become and how costly it is to our society.  The so-called benefits to employers are more than consumed by higher taxes for welfare, Medicaid and low-cost housing, as well as escalating health care costs, crime, drug abuse, etc.  Our unenforced immigration law is a broken policy that urgently needs to be fixed.
 
Please support the actions necessary to correct this problem and help protect Floridans, our jobs, our welfare system and our health care system from illegal immigration.  Our collapsing healthcare system would benefit greatly from a large reduction in the indigent care services for illegal aliens.  When you do the right thing, the problems we have will be corrected and cost less to us all.  The savings will help us provide better services for our legal citizens who deserve more for their taxes.
 
Please keep immigration reform on top of our state's national agenda, the same position it holds with our fellow citizens.
 
Thanks,
 
John W Gavin, MD (ret.)

Dear Governor Bush,
I am astounded at what is happening to the boatbuilding industry in my 
home state! I have been employed in the marine industry since the age of 
21 at Wellcraft Marine's Avon Park, FL facility, which was closed in the 
90's largely due to the drastic impact of the luxury tax on the company. 
I have owned my own marketing business doing work for Monterey Boats in 
Williston, Donzi in Sarasota, and more. I am now employed with Marine 
Concepts owned by Bob Long. I think you may remember Bob as being the 
President of Wellcraft Marine for over 17 years.
This all said, I am daily watching boat manufacturers flee our State. 
Why?  Because nothing appears to be happening to keep them.  I am a 
Florida native and dread the fact that by the time I am able to retire, 
the State will be nothing but a peninsula of tourists in condos.
What is being done to address the issue of manufacturers in the State 
involved in this mass exodus?
In the unlikely event that you actually happen to read this email - I 
realize that I am probably not important enough to you to take time from 
your busy schedule - I would appreciate knowing what you intend to do to 
keep this industry.

Hello Carolyn,

I received your contact information from Enterprise Florida as the point
person for Governor Bush's external affairs.  My name is Ken Paulus, I am
the producer of a business/technology conference taking place in Sarasota
on August 31st.  The name of the event is called the Sarasota/Manatee
Technology Conference (www.SarasotaTechConference.com). Our goal is to
turn this into an annual event that focuses on the entire Gulf Coast of
Florida.

Attached is an invitation letter and our latest press release highlighting
just a few of the speakers and organizations involved in the conference.

I can say that for a first-time event, the response up and down the coast
of Florida has been phenomenal.  We think this would be a an excellent
opportunity for the Governor to address an audience that is critical to
the future of Florida's business and technology development success.

We have assembled a top-notch speaking lineup never before produced in
this area of the State!

Please feel free to contact me anytime if you have any additional questions.

I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Cheers,

Ken

Subject:	[*] FORWARDING A LETTER TO THE MAYOR OF AVON PARK FLORIDA TO ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OF FLORIDA.

I wrote a letter to the Mayor of Avon Park after reading about the International and National headlines of the laws the City would like to put in place concerning illegal immigration. So that people here in the County and around the State and Country can know and understand that what the Mayor is trying to do is backed by some people of his community. Here is My letter Governor Bush:
  

Dear Mayor, City Council, The Legal  AND illegal Citizens of Avon Park and Highlands County, and the whole Country at large,

Thank you all for taking the time to read my letter to you.

Point 1.

There is one thing that I have learned in my life, having lived many places here in the USA as well as abroad in other lands, and that is in order to remain a peaceful land and happy, communication is the number one issue which either makes or breaks a conversation and a community at large. America for over 200 years has not felt the need for an official language. We have official wildlife, official flags, official birds, official flowers of every state and of the Country as a whole but We are far behind in the officiating of an official language for the Country. I personally think now more then ever in order for this land to continue to enjoy all of its Freedom and Security and PEACE for ALL Americans and those who come here to Our land legally and to become Americans that we have enjoyed now for generations, we are going to have to have a means to communicate better to the world at large that’s standing at our door steps, as well as those already inside the door. Many of those who come here from other lands know before ever leaving their world that in order to thrive and survive here they must learn to speak and read English, this has been the beliefs in many countries, and just a taught courtesy and a show of respect for Our land when people of other lands enter here, and Americans have always learned other languages of other countries We were traveling to and we expect to do such, however there are a few countries of people who not only feel that learning the language that this country has majority spoke for over 200 years is unnecessary but feel that We as a Country should learn their language in order to communicate to them. This is an arrogant thought process in the belief that their people and language will soon become the dominant language spoke in the USA. I believe in helping the illegal aliens, I married one over 20 years ago and assisted him in becoming a legal citizen when I found he could not gain the information he needed to do such in order to be here in this country legally when I fell in love. He learned how to speak English before coming to Our land and he himself cannot understand people who come here not knowing how to speak English and feels that it’s a slap in the face of Americans when its expected for the populous at large to know second languages of other countries not of their origins when not in that land. The system in place works for those who use it but the problem is that most will not ever be a part of the system that puts illegal on the right tract to citizenship and as long as the government continues to provide ways to accommodate illegal aliens to thrive and survive here over the rights and needs of English speaking persons and Americans, and those who come here legally, with out applying the very same issues that those who come here legally have to pass thru and those who are here that desire to become American, are willing to learn to become such, including reading and writing English, then the masses of those who live under the laws of the land here in our country are belittled and berated. The practice of not making illegal aliens from all lands adhere to the same rules the rest of Us here born in the USA have followed and might possibly took for granted up till now, today assumed was based on the language of the majority of the past 200 years, English. Now as you can see I am not the best at writing and speaking English my self, but I hope that my words have reached each one of you as you go forward in making the tuff decisions for us all and pray that you know that me and my family back the Mayor of Avon Park in his efforts against all odds and hope you all will have the courage to take the road less traveled for the better ment of all the people in this Country but especially the English speaking from all lands of the world as well as Americans. We do not feel that We as an American and Legal Resident Alien are being racist, biased or prejudice in our thoughts on this issue. I have a right to speak up and state My opinion to you as an American, as well as those who are on the other side of the fence and opinion legally do, but illegal aliens are not afforded the same rights because they have not pledged to the Constitution or flag of this Country or respect either so why does the government accommodate those who don’t as though they have? 

Point 2.

Big business has lived off the backs of the poor person from other countries far to long with agriculture bringing in people from other lands to provide cheap labor when the American work force of Americans and Legal Aliens are not even being given a chance to work in such a trade in today’s times. When was the last time you seen a ad in the local news paper that asked for fruit pickers for the orange crops in the area ? Or how about a ad to go reap sugar cane down south during season? I’ve lived here half my life and I’ve yet to see any, so before Big business comes to My government and news papers and community officials complaining they don’t have enough workers to do a job here I suggest reaching out to the available workforce of Americans and Legal Aliens that are already here in the community, county, cities and USA like the regular business owner here who has to put an ad in the paper to gain a work force and you just might not go with 10 million sum odd oranges not being picked.(Course you will now be forced to pay a fair wage to legal working citizens and cut your profits.) Dont blame the loss of illegals for the issue but more the government that has put a ban on all oranges being shipped outside the state as being one of the main reasons oranges are still on the trees. Both me and my husband picked fruit in our pasts as a week end second job until the groups of illegal aliens and groups of tempt workers from outside the country undercut the wages we were earning in the fruit picking business to the point that a second job was not even profitable to have doing it. I felt sorry for the legal emmigrants and americans who used this income as their main support because there very livelihood was cut out from under them by big business going outside the country for cheap labor and the illegal alien. I’m a simple woman of simple means but I know the issues the Mayor and Council are taking to task and I know it will be a very ruff and hard one to fight but again me and my family stand by you 100% on the issues We all are facing here. God bless America and God bless you all in your actions, and thank you again for serving our community.

P.S.

Id also like to add that I have read this document and disagree with its whole contents based off of one issue,

http://www.splcenter.org/images/dynamic/main/IJP_Avon_Park_letter.pdf

This issue and laws that address this are in place for the Citizens of this Country that were either born here or here legally. These laws do not extend to those that are already here by breaking the laws of the land and here illegal. I think all of the issues that the Immigrant Justice Project and Southern Poverty Law Center bring up would be fine if we were dealing with those here legally or those who were born here. That’s who these laws cover, or my interpretation of such, or are we now going to go to other countries and expect that country to follow our law of the land because by saying that illegals here are covered by our laws that is in essence what we are saying is that our laws will also cover every human being on earth over and above its Citizens and Legal Aliens here in this country.

Subject:	Suggestion to solving illegal immigrant issue

Dear Mr. President and Governors,
 
July 20 ,2006
 
I would like to make a "SIMPLE" suggestion for solving the national problem regarding illegals in the USA. I will try to be brief and am hoping each of you personally gets to read this email. My name is Frank Savalli, I am a 58 year Italian-American republican from the Midwest (Grand Rapids, Michigan) and transplanted to South Florida 6 years ago. I live in a very affluent area called Aventura. I spent most of my working career as an executive in a smaller corporation in the Midwest before starting my own consulting business. I live in a county(Dade) that is 60+% Hispanic and have to listen "often" to the negativity re: immigration issues. I know each of you must be aware of the huge underground economy that flourishes in this country and in your states with illegals working "under the table." Some of my conservative friends back in Western Michigan would suggest we round them up and deport them all. They view the crisis as one of illegals taking jobs from Americans. Reality is if you were to "round them all up" (at least in So. Fla.) the economy would fall flat on its face down here and I suspect the same would be true in So Cal or Texas. The thousands (probably millions) of workers in restaurants, the trades, etc., can't be replaced by Americans; there aren't enough "willing workers" left to take some of these jobs. Prices will go skyrocketing. Now the crazy Midwestern think we're just talking about migrant fruit pickers..they have absolutely no idea just how much this area and I suspect other areas have come to rely on this underground worker.
 
So I ask, is there anyway you "Key National Figures" could work together and announce together a national solution (a way to turn all the negativity the republicans are getting and the Bush's are getting down here, and in other areas I'm sure)?? What if you could suggest a way to turn the negative into a positive????....by coming up with a plan that will allow conditional amnesty. Each illegal would come forward and register, get a temp      Soc. security number, and be allowed to legally stay and work in the USA.  Future immigrants coming would have this blueprint to follow so we're not back in the same situation 10 years down the road.   The Conditions: they must be employed if they are over X age, and PAY TAXES on their "full" income. Now think of all the lost income taxes and lost Soc security taxes in the country right now due to this underground economy..if  then a bipartisan appointed committee could prepare the projections of added taxes to collect I can't image any democrat voting against this idea. The ultra conservative republican wouldn't even think about saying no to more taxes dollars coming in without having to raise taxes. Every 6 months they would have to come in a show their pay stubs to some office to continue their amnesty. After X years of doing this successfully they have now proven their worthiness to become citizens. This sure seems like a WIN-WIN situation for everyone involved: The country, the illegals, the economy, the Bush's, the Republican Governors most affected. It sure would be great to hear the Hispanics down here not saying things like "Bush is so slow to help us" or the democrats would help us more if they were in power. With the Hispanics now growing into the countries largest minority..it would be great if they would more unilaterally feel they owe their ultimate citizenship to the Republicans. I hope you ALL can jump on this ASAP before some other politician comes up with something similar and takes your potential thunder away for their own political aspirations. Thank You for your time and consideration...I'm not looking for any notoriety on this matter     what-so-ever...you may all feel free to suggest it was your own concept. Good Luck and God Bless 
America.
 
Sincerely,
 
Frank Savalli

And by the way you guys will be under investigation

Subject: [FL_LoS] Florida's Legislature Should Follow Colorado's Example 
Reply-To: fllos@freeflorida.org 

Gov. Bush should call a special session to do in Florida what Colorado has done. The news item below was received from F.A.I.R.  If every state and city did this, many illegal aliens would decide they should go back home voluntarily. 
Susan M. Lamb 
5846 Mt. Carmel Terr., #313 
Jacksonville, FL 32216 
  
Colorado Governor Bill Owens called a special legislative session to focus on the problem of illegal immigration. That special session, which ended last week, resulted in the passage of some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country. In particular, the special session intended to address a proposed ballot initiative passed during the regular legislation session that the Colorado Supreme Court subsequently struck down. However, during the special session, members of the Colorado Legislature decided that instead of re-writing the ballot initiative and sending it to the voters in November, they would pass legislation with similar language. The new law, which will go into effect August 1st, requires individuals to demonstrate their legal presence in the U.S. before receiving state and local benefits. In addition to this new law, the Colorado Legislature passed several other immigration bills, including one that requires all contractors servicing state or local agencies to attest they are using the Basic Pilot Program. "It simply puts teeth into existing federal regulations," Governor Owens stated. "Nobody I know is content with today's status quo." Andrew Romanoff, the Democratic speaker of the Colorado House added, "Washington should take Colorado's hint."

Subject:	Adoption Placement - Follow Up

Hello Governor Bush,

 

I hope this email finds you doing well. 

 

I wanted to follow up with you regarding our licensing issue. I understand that you have asked Mr. Kaplan to review this matter. I have also been told that Ms. Hadi is investigating the matter as well. Since that time Shane DeBoard, DCF attorney in District 7, has dismissed all actions against us in that district. However, the revocation in Broward County still stands.

 

Unfortunately, this has become a very urgent situation. Without taking too much of your time, I want to outline a couple of the factors that are now involved:

*	Families’ adoptions are being significantly delayed. Children are waiting in orphanages. We know of at least one that has died due to the unavailability of adequate healthcare in the orphanage. The child would likely have lived if the adoption could have been finalized.
*	The agency is in a financial hole that is approaching the point of being insurmountable. We are behind in our lease and have not made payroll for five weeks. At this point, we are nearly $200,000 in the hole.
*	All of our staff are in significant financial straits. We are all behind in our personal bills to the point of possibly losing vehicles and having our credit affected negatively.
*	Our staff members are being affected medically. Our insurance was cancelled due to non-payment of premiums. One employee just required major surgery and was forced to proceed without insurance. She also has three children that are now not covered. Personally, I am epileptic and can’t afford my anti-seizure medication. My wife and children are also without insurance.

 

As I’ve mentioned numerous times, I don’t understand the actions that were taken by DCF officials in District 10. No children or families we ever endangered by our actions. I continue to be confused by the severity of their intervention – an outright revocation. I am especially befuddled, because recent events involving severe sexual and physical abuse of children in day care and foster homes – some resulting in the death of children – were not initially met with the same severe consequences as those given to Adoption Placement. 

 

For example, the Kid’s Palace Day Care Center’s Director, Joshua Palin, was arrested for at least 12 counts of child molestation. According to reports, the Center’s license was initially SUSPENDED following his arrest. It was not until later that their license was revoked – following an investigation. Why was our license revoked on the spot without even as much as a phone call? Many other instances, in which DCF has openly admitted fault, involved care providers who were not adequately supervised and ultimately abused or neglected children in some fashion – some resulting in death. Several of those facilities are still operating. It is also true that several felons in the state of Florida have been issued licenses to operate Day Care Centers. I trust you can understand my confusion in light of these facts.

 

I am not asking for anything other than the ability to become licensed in District 7. I’m not asking DCF to admit any wrongdoing, and I’m not interested in anyone losing their jobs or anything of that sort. I am not seeking any public intervention or attention. I am simply asking that the revocation in District 10 be withdrawn so that we can pursue licensure in District 7.

 

I know that we are scheduled for a DOA hearing in August. Unfortunately, I don’t think the agency, or its staff, can survive that long. And even if we could, we can not afford adequate representation to assist us in that matter. As such, I am respectfully requesting that action be taken at the soonest possible moment.

 

Once again, I appreciate your consideration as well as the time you have taken to look into these issues and reply to me previously. I am looking forward to hearing from someone in your staff as soon as possible.

 

Respectfully,

July 19, 2006

Dear Governor Bush,

It is with great pleasure that I write to recommend Yvonne Colodny for a county court judicial position.

Yvonne possesses the qualities that are essential in a judge: fairness, knowledge of the law and professionalism. Mature beyond her years, Yvonne is the quintessential defense attorney. She passionately advocates for her clients while demonstrating respect for the judicial system and maintaining a professional relationship with her adversaries.

As a new lawyer assigned to the Domestic Violence Unit of the Public Defender’s Office, I was fortunate to have Yvonne as my trial partner. Yvonne guided me through my very first trials and served as my mentor in the Public Defender’s Office. She has taught me many things over the last five years and her role in my development as an attorney has been crucial. Yvonne taught me how to conduct a good cross examination, she taught me the significance of punctuality and civility in the courtroom and she taught me the important thing a new lawyer can learn: always be prepared. 

As a training attorney Yvonne positively influenced many young attorneys. Her trainees depend on her ability to analyze a case, conduct research and to communicate effectively with clients. They know that they can rely on her to thoroughly prepare a case, have the correct case law and effectively communicate with even the most difficult client or attorney. 

Yvonne exhibits the character and skills expected of a member of the judiciary. She has passion for the law, respect for the judicial system, encyclopedic knowledge of the law and empathy for the human condition. 

Sincerely,

Judy Cullinan, Esq.

Govenor Bush,

This is unusual for me to take the time to write anyone on an issue, but I 
feel as an RN registered in this state for over 30 years it is necessary.  
This nurse who devulged private patient information is definitely in the 
wrong.  When she first did this, I was certainly upset myself that she would 
do such a thing.  You certainly did not see other nurses doing as such.  It 
is up to our Board of Nursing to handle this situation not your office.  If 
this was the truth do you not think other nurses would have spoken up.  
After all we believe in life and try to preserve it and more nurses would 
have come to Mrs. Schiavo's defense.

Thank you for listening and I hope you reconsider your involvment.

Sincerely,  Melba Thompson, RN

As registered voters in Okaloosa County, we respectfully request that you

Eglin Air Force Base.  The proposed move to Edwards Air Base in California 
appears to be one of politics rather than good economics or practical 
military application.  A move of this magnitude (1500 military and 1900 
civilian positions) would be seriously damaging to northwest Florida in 
particular and to our state of Florida in general.  Please join with 
President Bush, Senators Nelson and Martinez, and all of our Florida 
Representatives to keep the 46th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base.
Thank you,

Governor Bush,
  hello & hoping all is well with you and your family. i am writing today with concerns of the test wing here at Eglin moving to Edwards AFB in california. i cannot stress enough to you that this is not a good thing. we at Eglin feel that this is not a strategic move at all not to mention the disruption of the lives of so many personnel that have dedicated themselves for many years to this fine base. we whole heartedly feel that we are an integral part of national security and not just time card punchers. the compassion and dedication of the individuals i see on a daily basis is overwhelming and is what compels me to write to you. i know at all levels whether it is in industry, government, or private enterprise there is a need to look at ways of saving money, even in our own homes we draw a budget up to save and put away. but sometimes we have to evaluate the bottom line and ask how much we can save but at what cost. do we simply abandon the people who made us what we are today so we can save money or make more money. the loss of this test wing would put people into a local job market that doesn't support their individual skills or pay structure that they have or had have. many of us love this area and cant see moving away from it for their own personal reasons. its a wonderful place for raising families and enjoying all types of activities from fishing/hunting to water sports off all types. i know you've been here and are familiar with the area. the Destin and fort Walton beaches are among the best here in Florida. we all have roots here and want to stay in this area. a lot of us have elderly parents here and other family that we don't want to leave from. the majority would have to relocate if this move occurs and that is far reaching to not only the individual but on the local economy level as well. on a personal note, my job has afforded me to travel all over the states and the world over the years, I've been to a lot of nice places and have seen a lot of this country but of all the places I've been, i have never seen any place i would rather call home than right here. so i am asking as supporter who has voted for your dad, your brother, and yourself to please show your support for us in the test wing at Eglin to do all you can to keep the move from happening. thank you so much and god bless.

I am writing to highly recommend the candidacy of Louise Zeuli for Circuit Judge in the 18th Judicial Circuit.  

Ms. Zeuli is one of the most meticulous, thoughful and tenacious attorneys I know.  She is experienced in many different fields.  In addition to working as a lawyer for the past 23 years.  She has been a critical care registered nurse, and educater.  Ms. Zeuli is one of the editors of a new book An American Legacy of Patriotic Prayers: Blessings of Liberty.

Her demeanor would be perfect for the bench.  She is a good listener, ethical, and honest.  She is always even tempered, and follows the law as it exists.  She will never legislate from the bench.  In addition to her work as an attorney, she is highly regarded as a mediator.  I attribute her success as a mediator to her great knowledge of the law, as well as her ability to communicate complicated issues in a simple and straightforward manner.  

Ms. Zeuli is extremely active in Seminole County, and the Central Florida area.  She is highly regarded by members of the bar, and judiciary.  

I have known Ms. Zeuli for years and am proud to recommend her to the bench.

Subject:	The New Medicaid Perscription Plan

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a 56 year old African American woman who has lived in Florida for the last eleven years.  I have a work record of 22 years as an Administrative Assistant.
 
In 2005, I received disability (after fighting for it for three years) for a heart problem and uncontrollable high blood pressure.  At the time, I was receiving my medication through the Share of Cost plan through the Orange County Health Department, as well as $259.00 in Food Stamps.  When my disability came through, they stopped the Food Stamps stating that I made too much money (I was receiving $1,083.00 for disability).  Somehow, I managed to make it through.
 
In 2006, Social Security increased my disability to $1,120.00 then put me on the new Medicaid Part D Prescription Plan.  I must pay either $2.00 or $5.00 per prescription.  As you can see from the list below, most of my prescriptions are not generic so I have to pay $5.00 for them.
 
My problem (and complaint) is my rent is $750.00 alone, leaving me with a balance of $370.00 to pay for electrical, water, telephone, cable and food which of course, is impossible.
 
I am writing you for some help.  This month, I couldn't afford to get my medicine.  I take meds for my heart, blood pressure, depression, acid reflux, etc.  Yesterday my doctor attempted to get me an emergency two week supply of meds for my blood pressure, which is very high.  He was denied because I have this new medication plan.
 
Governor Bush, I'm not in the habit of asking for help; I can usually find a way around a problem, but this one has me stumped.  You see, if I don't get this medicine, I will most likely have another heart attack (I've had two), stroke, etc.  I have been without my meds for two weeks now and I am suffering severe headaches.
 
If you know of an agency or anyone who can help me obtain my meds, I would appreciate it.  I thank you for your time.

Gov. Bush, 

I was hoping you'd take 5 minutes or less sometime in the next 2 weeks with a fun project we're doing. 

The theme: "the best of college football." The category: the best rivalries. Obviously, Texas-Oklahoma is one of them. 

You don't have to be a football expert to answer this. Just being a former Texas student is enough. 

I'm just asking a few folks from all walks of life for the one thing they dislike most about the other school; in this case, Oklahoma. Definitely doesn't have to be football-related; probably best if something off the field. Obviously, feel free to have fun with it. Could be a joke, a quick pot shot about Oklahoma, anything you'd like it to be. 

A few examples are below (you don't have to follow their format) of John Kerry on Harvard and Michael Dukakis on Yale. 
I'm just looking for a sentence or 2. 

If you could e-mail me back, I'd be eternally grateful. 

Thanks for your time.

Subject:	U.S. immigration policies

Mr. Bush,
 
As I'm sure you are aware, immigration has hit a nerve with legal residents of the United States regardless of their ethnicity.  My family immigrated from Europe before the Revolutionary War, and my ancestors fought for our freedom.  I believe they fought for the right for others to legally immigrate and improve their circumstances through hard work and sacrifice.  The borders overflowing with illegals lining up to take advantage of our social programs funded by working, legal, Americans is not what I believe they fought for.  It is certainly not what my active-duty husband signed up to do.  If you polled our military, you'd be hard-pressed to find any who support the current policy that allows illegals from Mexico no real consequences for breaking our laws.  They are not held to the standard of conduct expected by the rest of us, and they stand to gain so much for such relatively little risk.  Then they have the gall to make demands.  Listen to the voices of the legals making demands and you will hear a resounding chorus that the illegals go home.  
 
I believe in a hand up and not a hand out.  We have far too many legal citizens at the welfare trough, and now it's bait to lure, particularly citizens of Mexico, more to the feeding frenzy of something for nothing.  First, our welfare system is a mess.  Those who take should have to give and work for it.  You may refer to the welfare system of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for an excellent model of this.  Those able-bodied adults who take from the system return by cleaning buildings, doing yard work, or whatever work can be done to earn the help they receive.  We now have not only far too many legal citizens, and increasingly more illegals, lining up for whatever they can get at the cost of all of us who work.  No illegal should be eligible for assistance of any kind.  The only thing they should receive is transport back to their country as quickly as possible or time in jail.  I'd rather have my tax money spent to jail them and send them home than to teach them to teach their children how to mooch off the rest of us, thus breeding generations of people incapable of feeding themselves.  They will be a far stronger people if forced to provide their own livings in their country than if we teach them to beg for hand-outs.  As a Republican, you should understand that.  However, I've heard complaints that your own marriage resulted in the Bush family taking a more lenient stance toward immigration.  
 
Besides the negative affects on our economic health that illegal aliens from Mexico cause, there is the more troubling risk to national security.  As my husband gets ready to deploy and talks of the increased terrorist activity and their purpose being to try to find and stop terrorists I have to wonder what is going on in our government.  Why would we spend so much money sending our troops all over the globe before defending our own borders?  It's such an obvious open door for terrorism that it's probably in the first chapter of Terrorism For Dummies.  
 
The message I want you and all of our government on state and national levels to get is very simple.  Either you crack down on illegals strong, or be prepared to see a shake-up in our government come election day.  The smart politician will listen to the people who are strongly speaking out that English is THE language of this country, and Illegals are unwelcome.  The legal immigrants of this country had to work for it, although certainly in many cases, not hard enough.  We dole out too much to assist legal immigrants, but right now I'd settle for a crack-down on illegals.  I share my feelings about this with you, because like everyone else, I suspect you'll make a run for the White House.  I'm not the only one who thinks there is a certain amount of family pressure facing you on this.  Personally, I don't think so many from one family is a good thing for the White House.  Regardless, the candidate who gets my vote is the one taking a real stand on this issue, even if that candidate is from a 3rd party or from a family logging too much White House time for my taste.

RE: Illegal immigration

Thank you for taking the time to hear my concern over illegal immigration. I would like to urge you to push for legislation similar to that which Georgia, our neighbor to the north has done. If you are playing a game with someone and they consistently cheat, are you going to continue playing with them? No, you are going to take your marbles and go home. Illegal aliens are cheating the system. Our emergency rooms are swamped and our welfare system is overwhelmed. Imagine the good work these institutions could do for American citizens if they were not caring for criminals. As other states and cities enact legislation such as Georgia has done, and the illegal flee those areas the situation will grow exponentially worse for those areas that have not protected themselves. Instead of leaving it up to individual cities which will result in a patchwork of confliction rules and regulations, the state needs to enact a plan to let the illegals know that they are not welcome here. The Federal government is so tied up in knots that they are obviously not going to anything, so we have to.

COMMENTS: Hello I am looking to relocate to FL or GA to start my own trucking business. Texas does not offer enough incentive to set up shop here. They appear to be limited on funding for a minority/woman owned trucking operation. The Office of Economic Development only offers around $10,000 for each job created but they have ridiculous Personal Business Property taxes. They also do not fund non-profits. I have not decided between profit or non-profit. I am setting up a HIV education/screening/prevention program that works with the trucking operation hand in hand. It is not important if the operation should be in a rural area or not. I am flexible. Please let me know if Florida has better incentives. Thanks

My name is Steven Rogers and my concern is the job market, particularly in the panhandle area.  I live in Navarre which is east of Pensacola and west of Ft. Walton Beach.  Since part of Hurlburt Field's aircraft are planning to leave for Cannon Air Force Base and the 46th Test Wing is planning to leave Eglin Air Force Base this area will be hit hard by the loss of jobs.  I worked for DRS (laid off this morning), a local contractor for the military and now I have to try and find a job to support my family.  I don't know how many others were laid off but the rumor had the total at about fifty people.  All I have heard and seen is about companies going to southern Florida.  I have not seen your office nor have I heard your office trying to help us in the panhandle.  We are also part of Florida and would like good paying jobs to support our families.  There is a problem with good paying jobs in the panhandle but it seems that you only promote the southern section of our state.  Why?  What did we do to you to desire such treatment?  Why do people in Pensacola, Gulf Breeze and Navarre have to drive to Ft. Walton Beach to find decent jobs and not tourist type jobs that terminate at the end of the summer?  Milton is about twenty-six miles from my house and Crestview is about sixty miles but I will not be able to work in those areas because my wife's job is located in Ft. Walton Beach and we only have one vehicle for transportation.  This creates a problem!  My question to you is what are you going to do about it?  Or can we expect the typical response of being ignored and cast aside as the red headed step children of Florida.

Seeing Today’s Immigrants Straight

Complete article at: 
http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigration_reform.html

The proponents of amnesty have manufactured an artificial crisis. They say that it is imperative to legalize the millions of illegals here now, so that the illegals can “come out of the shadows.” In reality, the minor inconveniences imposed by illegal status are nothing more than what the illegals bargained for. Illegal aliens have no legitimate claim to be legalized before the country makes sure that its border control is working. 

Enforcement must precede a liberalization of immigration rules—which is why “comprehensive” immigration reform (the conservative code word for amnesty and increased levels of immigration) is not the solution to our border crisis but rather a guarantee of continued anarchy. Amnesty and the impossibility of enforcing a complicated new immigration scheme will undermine border control, just as they did in 1986. The first item of business on the conservative agenda should be enforcing the law already on the books. 

Reader Comment: 
While the vote for amnesty was 62-36 only 19 of the 62 senators who voted Yea are up for reelection in 2006. By placing special interests ahead of the interests of the country these senators have shown they are unfit for elected office. The 19 senators who sold out American workers that should be voted out of office in November are:

Akaka (D-HI) 
Bingaman (D-NM) 
Cantwell (D-WA) 
Carper (D-DE) 
Chafee (R-RI)
Clinton (D-NY)

Subject:	[*] Deny Proposed Move of 46 Test Wind From Eglin AFB

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Office of the Governor
The Capitol
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

As a resident of North West Florida, I am very concerned about the latest
talks of the 46 Test Wing (TW) possibly moving to Edwards AFB, CA.  As I’m
sure you already know, Eglin’s and the 46 TW’s missions have been studied,
scrutinized and validated in both Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 1995
and BRAC 2005.  This latest proposed move to somehow circumvent the latest
BRAC recommendations comes as a complete surprise and has many Eglin AFB
employees and Florida residents very upset and concerned.

Serving as the focal point for all Air Force conventional Weapon and
Armament (W&A), Eglin AFB is responsible for the Research, Development,
Acquisition, and Test & Evaluation (RDAT&E) of all air-delivered weapons.
This is possible for three main reasons: The first being the synergies
realized from the co-location of the Air Force Research Lab’s Munitions
Directorate (Research), Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Weapon Systems Wings
(Development/Acquisition), 46 TW (Development Test), and 53rd Wing
(Operational Test) at Eglin AFB; the second being the irreplaceable,
contiguous, and highly instrumented 724 sq miles of land ranges and over
120,000 sq miles of water ranges; and the third being state-of-the-art test
facilities such as McKinley Climatic Laboratory, Guided Weapons Evaluation
Facility, and the Preflight Integration of Munitions and Electronic Systems.

Several BRAC 2005 recommendations have other geographically located W&A
facilities realigning to Eglin AFB to further complement and strengthen
Eglin as a full spectrum W&A RDAT&E Center. The impact of these BRAC
recommendations will: increase W&A life cycle and mission related
synergies/integration; increase efficiency; reduce operational costs; retain
the required diversity of test environments; and facilitate multiple uses of
equipment, facilities, ranges, and people.

As a resident of Florida and a taxpayer, it makes absolutely no sense to
move the 46 TW to Edwards AFB.  If the truth be known it will likely cost
the taxpayer a significant amount of money to establish only a subset of the
capabilities that currently exist within the 46 TW at Eglin AFB with no
chance of cost savings now or anytime in the future.

As governor of this state, I am asking for your help to ensure the 46 TW
remains at Eglin AFB, FL to safeguard world class RDAT&E for future Air
Armament Weapons, the livelihood of thousands of Florida residents, and the
economy of Northwest Florida.

Nick & Rita Monte

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I called one of your aids this morning in the Citizen Services Department Laurie and she gave me your email address.  
I went to your office yesterday and talked to Laurie and Warren, regarding my immediate serious concerns about the safety of my daughter whose body is controlled by something I call it "Secret Weapon".  I have been trying to bring this issue to some people who may be abel to do something about it.  I wrote a letter to Carter Center a couple of months ago mentioning about this "Secret Weapon".  I understand it is a difficult issue and it takes time.  I am writing to you because you are the brother of President who has immediate access to every agency in the government.  If you check around, you may find more information.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely,
 
WenXuan Gu

As a voter and natural born citizen of the United States of America, I have some issues with the amnesty bill.  I see so much and hear of so much that it is unreal.  My dad, elderly and disabled, lives in a small community in North Florida.  We have caregivers that take care of him during the week.  However, the town( and county) is being taken over by Hispanics, and they surround his home(the home he built himself more than 60 years ago), and my elderly disabled aunt's home who is a widow and lives alone.  However, these Hispanics play loud music all the time day and night(festive music).  You can hear it everywhere.  They come out into the yard and urinate or pull their pants down and use the bathroom right out in open.  They cram 25 people or more into a small singlewide home. They walk thru my dad's yard constantly.  Their dogs just roam the streets or they chain them to trees and they bark constantly and are out in all kinds of bad weather with no shelter.  My aunt cannot even enjoy her front porch for those across from where she lives, who come out and urinate facing the street and she said they even stop their vehicles get out and use the restroom in public on the road.  Now tell me, this is right?  This is moral?  This is what we want our young children to see?  When the law is called they come and get them up passed out in the yard and I guess take them in to sleep it off.  Anyway, I cannot believe we are allowing this UNSANITARY and IMMORAL THINGS TO GO IN AMERICA.  WHAT IS HAPPENING?  NO WONDER CERTAIN DISEASES ARE COMING BACK PLAGUEING OUR COUNTRY.  CAN'T SOMETHING BE DONE ABOUT THIS?  WHERE IS THE LAW?  NO, WE DO NOT NEED TO GRANT AMNESTY FOR THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT FOLLOW OUR LAWS, MOST OF THESE I GRANT YOU ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.  PLEASE DO NOT PASS OR ALLOW THESE TYPE OF THINGS TO CONTINUE AND DEGRADE OUR COUNTRY.  NO WONDER THERE IS SO MUCH SEXUAL ABUSE GOING ON.

Subject:	Florida's Legislature Should Follow Colorado's Example

Gov. Bush should call a special session to do in Florida what Colorado has done. The news item below was received from F.A.I.R.  If every state and city did this, many illegal aliens would decide they should go back home voluntarily.
Susan M. Lamb
5846 Mt. Carmel Terr., #313
Jacksonville, FL 32216
 
Colorado Governor Bill Owens called a special legislative session to focus on the problem of illegal immigration. That special session, which ended last week, resulted in the passage of some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country. In particular, the special session intended to address a proposed ballot initiative passed during the regular legislation session that the Colorado Supreme Court subsequently struck down. However, during the special session, members of the Colorado Legislature decided that instead of re-writing the ballot initiative and sending it to the voters in November, they would pass legislation with similar language. The new law, which will go into effect August 1st, requires individuals to demonstrate their legal presence in the U.S. before receiving state and local benefits. In addition to this new law, the Colorado Legislature passed several other immigration bills, including one that requires all contractors servicing state or local agencies to attest they are using the Basic Pilot Program. "It simply puts teeth into existing federal regulations," Governor Owens stated. "Nobody I know is content with today's status quo." Andrew Romanoff, the Democratic speaker of the Colorado House added, "Washington should take Colorado's hint."

I do not understand why we never get the support of the governor or his office. I have sent invitations months in advance, invitations asking for the governor to let us know when is a good date and invitations with short notices and nothing.  Is not that we are always sending invitation and special request.

I remember just about four years ago when he was in his reelection campaign and he called on me and the Colombian Americans for our support and we were there.  I am very disappointed and expect an explanation as to the reason why.

Dear Governor,
 
Well, it happened again. I was so close to meeting you, but it did not happen. Two years during our recovery of hurricane Charlie, you visited our school, Neil Armstrong Elementary in Charlotte County. I was the Teacher of the Year for our school and was selected to escort you to our Media Center, for some reason they forgot to tell me this. So I did not get to meet you. I was in Orlando for the Teacher of the Year Gala, as I was chosen as Charlotte County's Teacher of the Year, I was in line to speak with you at our luncheon, but time ran out. Ugh! It happened again. Well, maybe when you come to Boca Grande, I can at least get a photo with you. My husband is in Real Estate on the island and we live very close to Boca.  I do appreciate the signed photograph you mailed me two years ago, however my students ask, "Did you get to meet the Governor?" I want to say yes, so much, but alas I cannot tell a lie.
 
Maybe one day.
 
Thank you for attending our Teacher of the Year event. It was an honor to listen to you speak.

Last year (2005), my husband, Kenneth Robert Foote, sent an application to have his civil rights restored so that he can purchase the pest control business, where he has worked the past nine years.  Janet Keels contacted us, as she could not find a felony record.  We ordered his record from Fairfax County, Virginia, and forwarded it to her.  
 
When he called her this year for an update, she was no longer employed there.  The Florida Clemency site reports that applicants are given updates, but we have not received any.  How can we get an update on his case?  
 
This is very important to us because the business owner is ready to sell to him.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

This is my second email.  I am not sure if the first one got to you.  I also wrote To Attorney General Charlie Crist at the same time.  I received a reply from his office with no help with reference to my clemency.

 

Governor Bush, I am seeking my firearms righst to be restored in Florida.  I am 54 years old, and have had all my rights restored by Ruben Askew in 1973.  I also had my disability from federal firearms restored in 1977 by the BATF.  I would like to ask you to review my file which is in the hand of the Clemency Board in Tallahassee.  I submitted my application along with my portfolio for the board to consider last January and received a confirmation from the secretary that they had my application.  Hunting season is just around the corner sir, and I would very much like to get into this years deer hunting season with a firearm in Florida.  My arrest and conviction had nothing to do with firearms, and was over 32 years ago.  I have been working in Papua New Guinea for the last 21 years teaching in a mission school with my wife, and two boys.  When I can home last year I saw a note in the hunting regulations that prohibited me from hunting because of my conviction in 1972.  I thought that all my rights had already been restored.  However, when I called the clemency board they told me that in Florida I still had to go through the clemency process.   So I submitted the paper work and would ask you to please review my application.  I am now home in the USA and living in St. Petersburg.

 

I know that you are a very busy man; however you are a man with feelings, and compassion.  Please consider my application for clemency soon Sir.  If you would like to meet me, all you have to do is call or write and let me know.  727-321-2443 home 727-517-5427 cell.  I will come to Tallahassee if you request it.

 

Thank you Governor Bush for your leadership in Florida these last eight years.  Your example has been a real encouragement to me and too many Floridians.

Dear Govoner Bush,

My husband and I have been working at the Boys Ranch in Live Oak for the last 14 months. I have told my boys in my Cottage how helpful you were to me a few years ago when I was trying to find help for my deaf friend. I have told them how I felt you and your brother were so family oriented and wanted the best for all families.

I was wondering if there was any possability that we could arrange for you to visit our campus?

Governor,

 

In addition to being a Sergeant with the Aventura Police Department, I am also the President of the Florida EDACS Users group.  This group is made up of police and public safety professionals that coordinate and maintain emergency communication systems for their agencies.  The EDACS Users group supports M/A-Comm radio systems which of course is now the State of Florida Radio system.  Each year we hold a conference in November and would love to have you attend to meet the group and possibly speak to us about emergency preparedness in the State of Florida.  This year’s conference will be in Altomonte Springs at the Altomonte Hilton during the week of November 14th.   If you would be available and are interested in speaking to our group of approximately 50-75 attendees we would be very excited to have you attend.   I understand that you are very busy so please respond whenever you have a moment to spare.  Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Subject:	Restoration of Civil Rights

I recently relocated to Florida from California, in 1996 I was convicted of 
Prescription Drug Forgery, I was released from Parole on January 6, 2003.

In California, I am automatically eligible to vote, and no process is needed 
for the Restoration of Civil Rights.

Upon my relocation, I'm wondered if there is an additional procedure that I 
need to take to be clear that my rights are restored in Florida.

Good Morning Governor Bush!
 
Having received so many letters from students of the 151 eagle-mascot elementary schools across the state, I feel confident that you have heard about the Florida students' American Eagle & Literacy Challenge (initiated by St. Augustine's Timberlin Creek Elementary.)
 
We are excited about the funds and awareness the students are raising for Florida's Early Learning Coalitions, the Governor's Family Literacy Initiative, and the American Eagle Foundation.
 
We are also excited about the Florida essay contest entitled; “How Reading Makes Me A Better American” / “Como Lectura Me Hace Un Americano Mejor.” 
 
Attached is an invitation to our Statewide Kickoff tentatively set for Friday, September 29, at 8:45am.  (Of course, if another date and/or time works better we will gladly change it.)
 
Also attached is the letter U.S. Congressman Ander Crenshaw wrote to First Lady Laura Bush, in support of this initiative, and the request for her to serve as the National Ambassador of Literacy.
 
There are many groups and celebrities joining this initiative like NASA (who is sending an astronaut for the Kickoff), the 5 million-membership service organization -- Fraternal Order of Eagles, the Boy Scouts, and bald-eagle Challenger who will perform a spectacular free-flight.  There are also strong possibilities of appearance by celebrities like Dolly Parton and Miley Cyrus (aka Disney Channel's "Hannah Montana.")
 
But...nothing is more important to our students than the desire for our Governor of the best state in the nation to come be a part of our great "Mayberry Day" festivities on September 29!
 
Sincerest thanks for your consideration!

Subject:	Avon Park, Fl Proposed Ordances

Hello,
 
I am emailing this to you with my concern on the Ordances that Avon Park Florida Myor Maklin is trying to put in ordance regarding Illegal Immigrants. 
 
1.  They have the city people in a uproar over the ordances they are trying to vote on and pass.  Conveniently,  as of Saturday fired their City attorney, which can be believed in relation to this situation.  As he has opposed it.
 
2.  Leaving the hispanics fearful as to loosing homes, jobs and such.
 
3.  The next vote date is July 24, Would it be a possibility, Jeb Bush, that you can be of some help in this matter as to what I don't know what you could do or say or even be there at the meeting.  Shed some light on this subject.
 
We can not just throw these people out in the streets, impose fines on businesses, and retroactive these fines can they?  Leaving legals in a position of being harrassed if this does, Major business leaving or even bankrupting due to this. 
 
The Immigrants as a whole is being blamed, for failing school sytems, Hospital problems, unsafe living within the city, crime rate has gone up , and on and on, Just because the possibility of prejudice which has been verbally expressed by the Chamber of Commerce.
 
These people alone bring in well over $500,000.00 a week in the fruit picking season, this year unfortunately many left early leaving fruit  upicked due to the stir up by the national, months prior to the season starting.
 
People/Familes who have brought business to established businesses in city threaten to Boycott the City, and some already have.  As it stands I see  real hardship in more ways than not is being provoked here.  
 
If you would take a moment, read online if you may, www.highlandstoday.com Avon Park news on Illegal Immigration situations, you will read and see what I am writing in my email.
 
Central Florida is the heart of  the citrus, do we want to just throw it away over some mayor who decides to copy another city and state as to riding of unwanted Illegals.  I find him a follower not a leader.  Taking Federal Government Issues into his own hands, I may be wrong, but these are people lives we are talking about.  Please Help if you can.  I thank you in advance as to reading and helping our communities survive.   Rhonda.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today on behalf of my mother and father, Oswell &
Mary Ann Maxwell.  They own a  small service station here in
Tallhassee.  My parents bought the business 20 years ago this year to
eventually retire on. They have always been hard working, christian
people who raised 5 children.  My dad served his country in the
Korean War, nearly losing his life to protect our freedom.  Now at
the age of 76, he is on the verge of losing his business.  The recent
gas crisis has put him in a tough situation, not knowing which way to
turn.  He needs to find some working capital and no one will lend him
the money, the interest rates are to high.  He has exhausted all his
efforts.  I am pleading for some help for my parents.  Are there any
types of low interest business loans that may help him at this
crtical time in his life.  He would never ask for himself, so I will.
He does't need and hand out but a hand up. Thank you for taking the
time to listen.

Hi,

The city of Avon Park is contemplating an ordinance that would make English the official language of city government and would allow fines and revoke business permits on businesses that rent or do business with illegal immigrants.

I was hoping to get a statement from the governor on this ordinance. It passed on first reading June 26 and is due for a final vote, Monday, July 24.

INAUGURAL MEETING OF SPACE FLORIDA BOARD OF DIRECTORS HELD IN TALLHASSEE 

On Monday, I chaired the inaugural meeting of the Space Florida Board of 
Directors.  Established by House Bill 1489, Space Florida houses the state's 
existing space and aerospace entities and will coordinate all space-related 
issues in Florida.  The Space Florida board will provide leadership and 
advocacy and actively work to strengthen the state's position in the civil 
and military aerospace sectors. Space Florida was among the recommendations 
put forth by the Governor's Commission on Space and Aeronautics. Growing 
Florida's economy through the space and aerospace industries is critical to 
the state's long-term prosperity. Space Florida will lead our state's 
efforts to continue attracting aerospace businesses that create quality, 
high paying jobs for Floridians. 


ORLANDO HOSTS FIFTH ANNUAL JUST READ, FLORIDA! LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE 

On Monday, I joined more than 3,500 superintendents, principals, reading 
coaches and district staff for the fifth annual Just Read, Florida! 
Leadership Conference.   During the three-day conference, state and national 
leaders, reading experts and guests share reading education strategies and 
best practices. Governor Bush was also joined today by Florida State Board 
of Education Chairman Philip Handy, Just Read, Florida! Director Evan 
Lefsky, Ph.D. and renowned author and screenwriter Antwone Fisher, who 
shared the importance of literacy and his personal struggle learning to 
read. Florida's commitment to high-quality instruction and accountability is 
changing the statewide landscape, not only in our schools, but in our 
communities. I am proud that Florida leads the nation in rising student 
achievement and with each year our students are continuing to close the 
achievement gap. When education leaders, teachers and parents work together 
to ensure the success of our students, we contribute to the overall strength 
and success of our state. 
      

FLORIDA REPORTS LOWEST CRIME RATE IN 35 YEARS 

On Tuesday, Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Jerry Bailey 
and I released the state's 2005 Annual Uniform Crime Report and announced 
Florida's index crime rate has reached a 35-year low.  The index crime rate 
dropped by 3.7 percent in 2005, compared to 2004. I applaud the hard work of 
Florida's law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line each day 
to protect the residents of our state, and this report highlights the 
results of their efforts.  This report shows that staying tough on crime 
works. 


STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT RADIO SYSTEM FULLY IMPLEMENTED 

On Friday, I announced the full implementation the Statewide Law Enforcement 
Radio System (SLERS).  SLERS gives more than 6,500 law enforcement officers 
the ability to communicate with their peers throughout the state using a 
central radio system.  With this new system, officers from various state 
agencies are able to effectively communicate with one another on one system. 
By providing a single system, Florida is able to provide law enforcement 
officers responding to an emergency with a more efficient means of 
communications and the ability to talk to one another in real time.

   Gentlemen
 
    No doubt that by now you have heard that the Powers to be at Eglin, AFB have made a underhanded plan to move the 46TH Test Wing to Edwards, AFB and to close two one of a kind facilities,
yes I  work at one of those facilities but more on those later. The land that surrounds Eglin at this time is highly sort after by local developers, land that makes Eglin unique. the perfect location to do
the type of test that is done here; land and water, both the Gulf and the Atlantic. At Eglin an ideal or concept if you will, can be born, decussed, tested and some even produced in the area. But it's not
 just the location, it's also the people as the Air Force found out when they moved the Electronic Warfare Testing out West, where the customer can only collect 60% of their data instead of the 95-100%
that they use to get at Eglin, also in less time than what it takes out west. The facility in which I work, the J-PRIMES an anichoic chamber, may not be one of a kind but the qaulity and workmanship is 
surpassed by none, just ask the Project Officers that have had the misfortune of testing out West. The BAF  is a much bigger chamber but not better. The McKinsley Climatic Lab is one-of-a-kind and it 
to is slated for closure. Most of the tests done at these two facilities are of sensity nature so further elaberations are not premitted. It has been said that the Test Wing is out of money ( what happen to 
the money?) and this is a way of cutting back on exspenses, no problem, these two facilities are SELF SUBSTAINING, that's right, we are so good at what we do that we have all the business that we
can handle. The Climatic Lab has a customer for the next twenty years. Yes I know that we all are small parts of the big picture, and that there are alot of things that we don't and can't know YES, YES
I know, but in this day and time don't you own it to the people to make good sound decissions? To get the most data for our dollars?

Governor Bush,

I am writing this email requesting you and/or your staff to assist me in 
expediting my request for interstate transfer from Maryland to Florida.  My 
paperwork was recently submitted and I am awaiting a decision.  Since 1996 I 
have committed two (2) common law misdemeanors (Non-violent) and served 
seven (7) years in the Maryland DOC system.  I am currently on mandatory 
release and probation.  These offenses were committed during time of very 
high stress and fear of life for my family and myself, which triggers my 
mental disorder (PTSD), which is service connected.  I am under doctors care 
for global, chronic/severe PTSD and have to take three (3) different 
anti-depressants daily.  I have recently been boarded for disability 
compensation for that PTSD and hear loss through Veterans Affairs.  I am 
awaiting a rating, but have been told that it would be 70+% for the PTSD and 
10% for the hearing loss since of their severity. It also appears that I 
would be found 100% disabled with the combination of these disabilities 
coupled with status of UI.  I can p0rovide you or your staff copies of 
letters from the Vet Center here in Maryland of my conditions.  I have been 
unable to hold a job in the private sector since my retirement in 1992.

I could have requested a disability claim years ago, but was " to proud".  
Now I am much older (60) and need the assistance to live.  I am listing some 
of my awards and decorations awarded me for service to our country.  (All of 
which can be supported by my DD-214 and/or military records).  They are as 
follows:

Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Air Medal, 5-Meritorious Service Medals, 
5-Army Commendation Medals, 4-Army Achievement Medals, Good Conduct Medals, 
Humaritarian Medal, Professional Development Medals, Vietnamese Cross of 
Gallantry, Master Parachutist Badge, Combat Infantrymans Badge (CIB), 
Special Forces Tab and other foreign service and campaign awards and 
decorations.

My wife and daughter are presently residing in our new home in Tampa.  If

I humbly ask for your kind assistance in obtaining a positive decision on my 
transfer from MD to FL.  I promise you that I will be of  problem to the 
state of Florida.  Tampa is currently my family's homestead residence and we 
plan on living there the rest of our lives.  We need your help to reunite

Dear Mr. Bush:
 
 Greetings!  I’m writing to you from Tampa, FL.  I have heard the news of how you have had various committees and task forces to help the people of Haiti.  I am writing to you today to request a position to help the people of Haiti.  I would be willing to work either in Florida or in Haiti.  I love the country of Haiti and the people of Haiti.  
 
 I grew up in Pittsfield, Illinois.  Since 1976, I have traveled to Haiti on various humanitarian aid trips.  Using only my own money, I accomplished several things.  I had an orphanage in Jeremie, Haiti.  I taught floral design and English as a second language.  I helped many Haitians start small businesses to support their families.  I gave tours of Haiti to missionaries and helped to translate for them.  For a time in 1987, I worked with the prime minister of Haiti, Jean-Baptiste Hilaire, performing research to find industries to start and plants to grow which would give people jobs.  All of these projects were to help the Haitian people to be able to live in their own country and support themselves.  If the situation were better in Haiti, everyone would want to stay there.  If it were not for the politics in Haiti which allow for the crimes and the poverty,  Haiti would be a paradise.  
 
 On August 18, 1996, I married Martine Bernard a Haitian national.  We have been blessed with two beautiful daughters, one 7 and one 3 years old.  We moved to Tampa, Florida in November, 2003.  Since being here, I have worked at a few jobs and even started a business, which failed due to lack of capital…so far I have not been able to support my family, not to mention not being able to help the dear people of Haiti.  
 
 I hope to someday start a nonprofit organization to help children in Haiti with nutritious food and proper schooling.  I would also like to have a place in Tampa to help the children of Haitian immigrants learn the American cultural differences, budgeting, English, computers, etc. which would help them to assimilate into the American culture.  It seems that the children of many immigrants are left to themselves while their parents are both working two or three jobs just to make ends meet.  These children many times fall in with the wrong crowds which give them the wrong start in life here.  I hate to see these children with so much potential, in a country with so much to offer, have their lives ruined.  
 
 If you could help me get a position helping the Haitian people in any way, so I could also earn enough money to support my family, I would be eternally grateful.  I speak fluent Creole, I have a bachelor’s degree in business management, an associate degree in liberal arts, and I have years of experience translating Creole/English in our church and for missionaries in Haiti.  I am very familiar with the Haitian culture.   
 
 Thank you for your consideration.   
 
     Sincerely,
 
 
 
     Michael L. Miller

Subject:	46th Test Wing

To the Honorable Jeb Bush,

 

This week a team of Air Force evaluators came to Eglin to tour our test sites that are slated to be moved to Edwards.  What they saw were the sites, many very simple in appearance, that have developed and tested the most sophisticated and highly accurate weaponry in the history of warfare.  What they didn’t see were the thousands and thousands of miles of underground data lines, signal and control lines, coaxial cable and the vast fiber optics grid that form the calibrated link to mesh the entire range into a synchronized data gathering complex of unparalleled accuracy – down to the specific angle, minutes, seconds and arcs of angles.  

 

They also did not see the highly specialized engineers, technicians and other professionals, many of which have spent entire careers devoted to making the impossible happen time and time again.  NO price can be put on the talent and professionalism at risk of being lost!

 

To abandon the 46th Test Wing’s vast assets, and try to recreate it thousands of miles away (in range of North Korean missiles) would take years and cost many times any projected savings.  Please don’t allow our national security to be put at such extreme risk over something that appears to be a savings – ON PAPER ONLY!

 

Respectfully,

 

Monty Wilson

34 year veteran of the Eglin Test Range

Subject:	National Security and Florida (Classified Information)

Dear Governor Bush:

I need to urgently address with you directly in regards to Secure Florida Initiative and your mission statement

To protect the citizens and economy of Florida by safeguarding our information systems, reducing our vulnerability to cyber attacks, and increasing our responsiveness to any threat. 

I am sending you this letter for I know that this information will be handled safely and effectively as it is indeed classified information and not to be discussed in an open forum.

We are a technological firm that specializes in a technology called Solar-Sonic Quantum Frequencies, that of which was the sole basis for the findings that ignited the initiation of this e-mail to you directly.  I give International Peace and Political advice and I am fully aware of National Security issues that effect us all.  Currently, I am in the process of contacting other high end government officials that can act on this most urgent Security issue. It involves North Korea and undetected technologies they are currently implementing.  Our technology, not yet to market, can read and evaluate such WMD.  It is of WMD never before  seen and is of immediate action that is necessary for Florida's protection and the entire West Coast.  

The Solar-Sonic migration routes effect gravitational fields and any flying objects both Space Crafts and Aircraft's.  It is critically important to also state that their capabilities also effect many other phases of our immediate environment.  I need to have a direct dialog with you for your assistance regarding for protection for all!  I cannot stress enough how bad this WMD is and how it can effect us all but especially right now Florida and the West Coast.  North Korea says they will continue doing Missile Testing but what they are not telling the world community is that they are doing another type of missile enhancement testing as well that currently the United States Government is unable to detect because it is done under Solar-Sonic migration routes.  At this time we believe that North Korea is the only country to have WMD Solar-Sonic missile enhancement capabilities (cross continent).  I have sent word on but have not talk to anyone directly yet and we should do so immediately; hopefully with you included.  As I do not yet have direct numbers for the highest levels needed, perhaps this is one area where you can be of immediate help and have them contact me for an urgent discussion to move protection forward from this WMD. 

Our firm has 100% accuracy rate of validation that such has been going on recently and can prove without any doubt the validity of the foregoing claims to you and all others to order to move protection forward.  With this frequency-based technology we are able to sense subtle shifting in gravitational fields and manipulate them.  Our technology can identify the shifting of every element that is airborne, like oxygen, hydrogen or nitrogen.  We can also use our technology to identify and create ion and photon clouds.  We know that we will be able to provide technical answers, solutions and protection in given time, but we should start immediately working with the Government to minimize and/or eliminate any potential risk pointed against us from all Foreign enemies.  Missile interception is one of the biggest capabilities under Solar-Sonic Quantum Frequencies, that of which will also benefit the current needs of the United States Military and its dilemma in Missile Defense and interception capabilities.  

Please contact me directly in order to move forward this most important issue.

Most Kind Regards,

We need to secure our borders immediately.  The suggestion to have a guest-worker program is a poor one.  It would create an huge magnet.
 
60% of the people in Nicaragua would emigrate to the U.S. if they could
70% of the people in Peru would emigrate to the U.S. if they could
This would create an imppssible situation.  The Administration should back off from this unwise proposal.

Robert E. Turner, Hillsborough County Property Appraiser, would be an 
outstanding choice to serve on this committee. I have attended many 
community forums at which Mr.Turner explained complex property tax issues in 
readily understood terms. He fully understands taxpayer concerns, and runs 
one of the best Property Appraiser's offices in the state.

Dear Governer Bush,
    My name is Anthony Morrison, age 17, and President of the National Honor Society of West Orange High School in western Orange County. Aware of what a position you hold, and the little time that you have, I will try to be as short and succinct as possible. Being an upcoming Senior in High School, I like many my age, seek so hard to "make a difference." For many Honor Societies among our High Schools, many volunteer activities are routine and annual events. And while nothing is essentially wrong with routine-ness, I only wish to "mix it up," to make a slight change . An idea I have had for this School year, is to get Honor Societies from a few local High Schools to combine forces in being involved in a mass community service project. My question for you is, are there any special events or tasks, community service opportunities in which you or anyone in the Central Florida area may need a mass number of voulnteers between the months of October of this year and April of 2007? We are seeking for a project that will both benefit the community and give light to the many teens hungry for change and the "good things in life," not drugs, sex, or violence. Any part you play or aid you give us would undoubtedly be pivotal in our efforts. Thank you Sir so much for time - I know that you are a very busy individual and I appreciate very much the time you have taken to read this short letter. Again, many thanks and I hope to be hearing from you very soon!

Governor Bush:
    During your trip to the UK, please do not miss the "Best Kept Secret in Europe", WALES.  Cross the Severn Bridge and enter an enchanted land that few, if any, travel agencies tell you about.  You can stay in Cardiff and drive through the surrounding countryside to see the most beautiful land in the UK, filled with quaint cottages, historic pubs, green hills covered with sheep and cattle and every few miles you will find still lived in castles or castle ruins.  I promise you it will be an experience you will never forget.  I was stationed there with the Army 1996 - 1999, commanding a depot at Caerwent and my daughter has lived there for 18 years with her Welsh husband in Newport.  England, Scotland and Ireland are publicized, but Wales is the Garden spot of the UK.

Dear Governor Bush,  
 
My mother in law, Bonnie Addario, has recently started a foundation for lung cancer and I was hoping you could take a moment to look into some of the things she is doing. Even if you just help to spread the word, it is appreciated.  Did you know that Lung Cancer kills more than breast, uterine & ovarian cancers combined?  Scary stuff!
 
Her foundation website is www.abreathawayfromthecure.org She celebrated her two year anniversary of being a lung cancer survivor in March.
 
We need your help.  There was just an article in Redbook Magazine on the rise of lung cancer in women...alarming!!... In the article they mentioned that there was really no place to go to help raise money for lung cancer, so we are even more dedicated to getting the word out that we are here...  
 
There are two events this year - a Golf Tournament in August and a Gala in November at S.F. City Hall.  Any way you can help would be appreciated...be it attending an event, donating time, prizes, auction items, ad space, plain ole monetary donations or even simply spreading the word.  We want to make Lung Cancer matter!  No donation is too small.
 
I know you have a busy schedule.  Thanks for taking the time to consider this.  Believe me, if you just have the chance to meet Bonnie, you will realize you want to be a part of this.  She is a fun fearless lady and she is going to do something to make lung cancer matter... please help in whatever way you can.
 
We would like to add your name to our honorary advisory board...please let us know if that is ok.
 
Take care,

Subject:	Illegal immigration

Dear Governor,
I am writing you in hopes that you will count my voice as that of Americans who one day will care what is happening to this country, but at present do not voice their opinion.  Unfortunately Americans have proven to be short sighted, lazy, and have short memories.  They tend not to take the time to voice their opinion unless it directly affects them, and even then it must be of substantial and immediate consequence.  Specifically I am speaking of the illegal immigration problem, and the effect it is having and will have on America.

I am a law enforcement officer her in South Florida and have been so for 13 years.  Prior to being a police officer here, I was in Military Intelligence for 9 years, also dealing with illegal immigration to a certain extent.  From my unique perspective I would like to convey to you how frustrating it is to deal with and watch what is happening in this Country, particularly South Florida.   It is my hope that you will exercise what influence you can to help protect our state and this country from continued unchecked immigration.

There are two primary areas of concern for us in South Florida, those that are happening in other areas of the U.S., and those happening right here.  In my honest opinion, as a citizen of the U.S., and as a law enforcement officer dealing with this quite frequently, I think the issues need to be handled in a similar and fair manner.  That is to say that the immigration laws should be enforced equally across the boards.  Those that have entered illegally in the past should not be granted any form of immunity.  To do so would set a precedent, both socially and legally, that would dictate concessions to those that violate our borders in the future.

With regard to the issue of Cuban immigration, and the crimes they commit with impunity while doing so, it really should be stopped.  I can’t emphasize the tremendously demoralizing effect on law enforcement personnel it has when these people conspire to smuggle, (crime #1) break the law to enter the country (crime #2), and yet they do not get charged with anything.  To make the matters worse, if they threaten the Coast Guard or other LEOs with sticks, etc. (crime # 3, felony) they get taken to dinner by the Mayor of Miami and get gifts on TV.  To top it all off, even those that didn’t make it to shore during that episode get to stay, … just another slap in the face of the law and those trying desperately to enforce it. 

It is very frustrating to hear irrational justification for allowing these people who come illegally to stay, such as “this Country was founded on immigration …” Many things have changed in the past 200+ years, and that is why the laws have changed to deal with those changes.  Those that believe in this argument must then also believe that slavery should also be permitted, because back when this Country was founded it was an accepted practice.  There should be no speed limits, as there were none when the Country was born.  The list can go on and on, and is ridiculous, just as is the claim that we should allow unchecked immigration now because it was allowed centuries ago! 

In closing I would like to say I have nothing against these people that come looking for a better life.  If I lived where they live, I would probably do the same thing.  That doesn’t make it right though.  In reality there are many countries in the Caribbean that are worse off than Cuba.  If I were from those countries I would be irate over the fact that I get “repatriated” no matter what, when the Cubans get to stay, even when they break all sorts of laws to get here.  I am not advocating allowing all others to stay, I feel all immigration should be applied for and achieved legally, meeting predetermined objectives.  

Probably the worst part of the whole situation is that the U.S. Government pays the smugglers (indirectly) to bring in the illegal refugees!   If the American population in mass knew that their tax dollars and social security dollars are going to subsidize the smuggling of illegal refugees, they would be quite upset!  Not to mention the fact that these illegal refugees are given Medicare, Social Security, business loans, etc, all without paying in a dime, it would really send the average American into a tirade.  How come the Federal Govt. does not make this fact commonly known to the American public?  Don’t they have the right to know they pay for smuggling efforts and illegal immigration?  The sad part of all this is, the problem would go away over night if the Federal Govt. stopped funding the smuggling.  It is one of the easiest problems to cure, and yet it continues.

Please do not support any sort of “amnesty” or reward people for violating our borders.  Please do away with the “wet foot/dry foot” policy and the Cuban Adjustment Act.  Set reasonable immigration standards that will protect our Country.  These standards should be fair and impartial, and all people desiring to immigrate to our land should have to abide by them, and we should NEVER pay smugglers to bring in illegal immigrants or reward people for committing crimes as they enter our Country.  Thank you.


Sincerely,

Glenn C. Test

Subject:	Fundamental Character of Old Homosassa

Subject:  July 11, 2006, 3-2 vote Homosassa Riverside Resort expansion approval

 

To Citrus County Commissioners Bartell, Damato, Fowler :

 

It has come to my attention that, at the Commission meeting July 11, 2006, you three Commissioners approved expansion plans for the Riverside Resort in Homosassa, Florida, with two fellow commissioners casting two Nay votes.

            I am shocked, appalled, dismayed, and insulted that you have blatantly ignored the over 1,200 petitions, letters and e-mails of your constituents in opposition to this project which violates the Old Homosassa District Overlay, part of the Citrus County Comprehensive Plan.

1.         This project is located in our Coastal High Hazard area absolutely forbidding this kind of development, 

2.         is directly on the Homosassa River, 

3.         is on environmentally sensitive acres, 

4.         is in a Hurricane evacuation route, 

5.         is in an area not zoned for commercial as the prospective new construction of 72 high-priced condominiums for private ownership will top 4 stories when the now height limits are 2 stories above parking,

6.         this expansion will negate the old cracker-style buildings, thereby destroying the effects of Old Homosassa as it is today,

7.         this project is too big.  The State program, Waterfronts Florida, is aimed at protecting the historical integrity and feel of old Florida Coastal Communities like Homosassa.  

8.         High-priced commercial and residential development here will destroy the old buildings and docks as they are now.

9.         this acreage is designated for only six (6) units per acre residential with the projected  4 story condominiums equaling more than eleven (11) units per acre.

10.       this project will overtax the roads, overtax the river, overtax the boat ramps and river traffic.

11.       Since Old Homosassa is a fishing village, this project will be detrimental to the continuation of employment in the fishing industry as it is today.

12.       If this project goes forward as planned, the original residents who lack the income to live on high-priced waterfront property face eviction from their homesteads.

To His Excellency Govenor Jeb Bush

Dear, Excellency Sir:

My name is Martha Lee Ben Haynes, I am writing to ask you to grant me the relief I am seeking, which is a pardon.  I was convicted of three felonies on July 26, 1996, at which time I was adjudged guilty and placed on probation.  The primary purpose of this letter is to appeal to you, and to ask your Excellency for a Certificate Of Restoration Of Civil Rights, that I may obtain a salable job position to support my family; so that I may become a more productive member of society.  I have been out of trouble for a long time, since my trouble with the law I have given my life to the Lord and I am now an Ordained Evangelist, preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  I am very active in my Church and Community; but unfortunately my criminal record has hindered me from obtaining gainful employment.  I want to attend school to become a nurse, there is a company that is willing to send me to school, but I will need to have a Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights.  All I am asking Your Excellency, is for a chance to give back something to society and with your help I can do it.  Until I hear from you I shall remain.

Sincerely yours,

Evangelist Martha Lee Ben Haynes


P.S.  I am sending a formal letter in the mail.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Governor Bush,
    Please know the honor I feel in writing you to do all you can to enforce the law in our state, as illegal immigrants continue to FLOOD us! They have a stronghold here, and are continuing to bring in more family members. NOTHING is being done to STOP them as they drain our welfare system, to which they are NOT ENTITLED! 
   If they have LEGAL work passes and strict back ground checks to make sure they are not criminals or terrorists, then they can abide by the law, being thankful to be able to come there to work. Instead, they are dividing our state into two distinctly different peoples with two languages! They need to be DEPORTED for BREAKING THE LAW!Until the law is enforced, more will be encouraged to come! 
   They are bringing us terrorists, illegal drugs, and diseases that we formerly no longer had-Welcome back, antibiotic resistant tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis A, and other diseases known to the sub tropics and not usually seen here. 
   In addition, I understand that there is missing nuclear materials unaccounted for in the former Soviet Union and traced to immigrants who are in collusion with terror groups coming into our nation plotting a great strike against multiple large American cities at one time. 
   What are we thinking by not enforcing the law? NATIONAL SECURITY IS AT STAKE, as well as our way of life, which the radical Muslims wish to destroy and rule over us, as our system collapses both internally from attack at every front and externally if they do follow through with these bombs. PLEASE DO SOMETHING and BEG your brother, our President to change his mind on this issue!
   Please know that we pray for our leaders to have the strength to weather the scary times in which we live and for our God to give wisdom and continue to protect us. We are truly at His mercy!
   With great respect and appreciation for your service to our state and nation,


Sincerely,

Subject:	DOER ACT and EGLIN TEST WING RELOCATION

Governor Bush,

I am writing to ask you if you have made any connection between the recent (June 14) testimony of Colleen Castille to the Committee on Resources and the subsequent passage of the DOER act (June 29) and the recent announcement of the test wing closure at Eglin Air Force Base. 

I am aware that a major part of Ms. Castille's testimony included the problems and issues that could arise from Florida offshore drilling with the test wing here off the Florida coast.  I am also aware that the chairman of the Committee on Resources is a California congressman, Richard Pombo (R-CA)  As Edwards Air Force Base is the other major test facility in the country, and California's Edwards AFB will surely gain from our state's loss at Eglin, I wondered whether this connection was being made in you or your office. 

I am not reading this information in any of the news articles I have read about the potential closure. I am aware that the BRAC was kind to Eglin in November and this news is sending some north Florida communities reeling from shock. 

I have always been a supporter of yours and imagine that the federal government is utilizing the DOER act and this move to manipulate the economic success of Florida and allow greater access to Florida's waters, while relieving Ms. Castille of a large argument she made against offshore drilling.   
I, personally, am not concerned about offshore drilling. Our states currently have great success drilling in the middle of Illinois cornfields with little effect on the crops coming up there, and I know we can certainly use the fuel, especially with the mid-east situation and again now the Israel situation as it stands. 

However, I do have a significant interest in the possible decision to kill or relocate the test wing from Eglin, and would like to hear what you have to say about this development.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

In Remembrance

of

Ambassador William T. Pryce

1932-2006

 





It is with sadness that the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas informs their members and friends of the passing of Ambassador William T. (Bill) Pryce this past Tuesday, July 11, 2006, at his residence in Alexandria, Virginia.  

 

He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Joan M. Pryce; daughter Kathy Pryce; sons Jeffrey and Scott Pryce; sister Katherine P. Collins; and five grandchildren.

 

Friends may call on Sunday, July 16 from 2 to 3 and 6 to 8pm at the Demaine Funeral Home; 520 S. Washington Street, Alexandria, VA.  Funeral services will be held on Monday, July 17 at 11am at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 228 S. Pitt Street in Alexandria, VA.  

 

Bill Pryce served as Vice President of the Washington office of the Council of the Americas from February 1997 until his retirement in January 2003.  Ambassador Pryce came to the Council following a career as a Foreign Service Officer who specialized in Latin America.  His last overseas assignment was as U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, where he played a major role in advancing U.S. business interests and in resolving outstanding expropriation disputes.  Prior to Honduras, he was Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the National Security Council.  He contributed to the development of the “Enterprise of the Americas” strategy of increased trade and investment concurrent with debt reduction, and helped negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

 

Earlier Washington assignments included service as alternate U.S. representative to the Organization of American States and representative to the Economic and Social Council, and special assistant to the Under Secretary of state for Economic Affairs.  His overseas assignments in addition to Honduras have been to Mexico City, Moscow, Panama, Guatemala and La Paz.

Now he has served more than 15 years of the 30 year sentence.
In the meantime many things have changed  in Michael's life. His beloved Dad passed away in autumn 2004 and a year later we both have married. We can hardly expect it,  to build up together a new life.
 
I know, you are a very busy man and my  English knowledge are still not perfect. Perhaps you remember, that I'm  Swiss.
Therefore, I don't want to steal your time. About two months ago my husband has submitted his Clemency Request. And now I only want to appeal to your goodwill, when you decide over the  Clemency Request of my husband.
 
He is a good man and will never commit a crime again.  I'm convinced,  he will be a useful member of our society and I will support him with all my strength.

I realize you are in the process of deciding whether to  remove Ms. Sarah Devos as Commissioner in Charlotte County.    If you look at the public records of properties she owns  (on Charlotte County Property Appraiser website) , it is obvious  she  has not been a "resident" in her district for almost two years.
 
Her residential property holding in Charlotte County are in excess of $2 million......half of that was acquired since she claimed to have been "blown out of her district" by hurricane Charlie in 2004
 
She has no intent to "live in her district".   Her claim to legitimacy by contracting to "rebuild" on one of her properties in her old district is a thin excuse to remain in office.
 
Look at her properties....look at when they were purchased......understand her true intent....common sense tells you she needs to be removed from office now.

The motive I am writing you is to ask you a favor to check my husband's
sentence as of today who has already spend three years of a thirteen

since he has been in prison. My children and I visit him every Sunday.
He is a great father and excellent husband but he made a big mistake to
the society.  However, we all have the right to rectify it.  I am asking
you to give him a second chance.  It would be the best present you can
give my children this coming Christmas.  If you check his records you
will be able to see how of a good man he is, hard worker and honest.
Primarily, I leave this in God's hands as well as yours.  His case

Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

 
Re: Appointment of Louise B. Zeuli, Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida
 

Dear Governor Bush:
 
As a business owner for more than twenty years, and a resident of Seminole County, I am writing to ask your help in a matter I consider to be of importance for our community. That is the appointment of of our next Circuit Court Judge for the Civil/Family division in Seminole County. 
 
I feel it is vital to ensure that those we elect are honest, fair, qualified for the position they seek to fill, have a love of their community, and a genuine concern for the well-being of the people that reside there. Currently, I am an active member of the Manufacturers’ Association of Central Florida, and volunteer my time to serve on the Advisory Board for the Small Business Development Council. I like to help make a positive difference where I live and work, and I believe Louise Zeuli is like-minded.
 
This brings me back as to why I believe Louise Zeuli is the natural choice to fill Judge Stephenson’s seat in the civil/family division. Louise grew up in Sanford – she is not a transplant. She knows the people, the problems they face, and the issues with which they must deal. Louise can be tough when needed to be, yet she is always fair. In her Practice of Law, Louise has chosen to specialize in mediating – finding fair solutions that work for all parties of interest, rather than to use the law as a tool for people to spite one another, or for her own personal gain. 
 
Her background as a Critical Care Registered Nurse, Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP), and as an Educator/Teacher, clearly exhibits her caring and compassionate side. Her twenty-three years as a general civil litigator proves that she has an extensive knowledge of the law, and is highly qualified to serve as our next Circuit Court Judge.
 
As someone who has volunteered for a number of worthwhile organizations that assist in areas such as raising money for the purchase of capital equipment for local hospitals, the rescue and rehabilitation of injured and orphaned wildlife, and organizations that assist the physically and mentally challenged in living independently, I understand the sacrifice it takes to help make a difference.
 
Louise’s community involvement and service includes:
- Volie Williams’ Inns of Court, Program Chairperson, past President, current Board Member
- Board of Director Member for Seminole County Legal Aid Society, Inc.
- Seminole Community College’s Community Advisory Board Member: Lecturer to their nursing students on legal liabilities
- Rotary Club of Seminole South, Board of Directors
- Chairperson of Community Service II Committee, which reviews and allocates charitable donations to worthy charities in the community
- Volunteer to help feed the homeless
- Rotary Club member and volunteer for Habitat for Humanity
 
As a member of this community and a registered voter, I ask you to help make a difference in ensuring that our next Circuit Judge is someone who will be fair, uphold the law, and who has the ability and desire to make a positive difference in our community. Please recommend Louise Zeuli for 18th Judicial Circuit Court Judge – Civil/Family Division, Seminole County.
 
Best Regards,

Jody E. Hill, President

Subject:	Sara Devos is No Rudi Giuliani

Dear Governor Bush:
 
When former NYC mayor Giuliani's term was up, the city of NY wanted him to stay on and get him through the 9-11 tragedy.
 
There was one problem -  his term was up!
 
Sara Devos is making a mockery out of Charlotte County - if the rules say she must leave - THEN SHE MUST LEAVE!!!! Pure and simple! 
 
How do I explain to my children that it's not okay for THEM to break the law, but it IS okay for Sara?  Should I tell them, "Well....that's different!"  It's not, Governor Bush and we all know it!
 
As I look around Charlotte County, I STILL see trailers in front (or back) of owner's homes.  They are living in these tiny trailers waiting for their work to be done. These are the people who suffered through Hurricane Charley, not Sara. Living in a trailer was too good for Sara and she made it a point to say she would never return to her home.
 
Pure and simple - she broke the rules or the law - her term is finished!
 
Sara Devos should not even be in the same sentence as the former mayor of NYC - but even HE knew the law.  Life WILL go on in this county without Ms. Devos - it might even be for the better.  Please remember this - pure and simple - she doesn't live in the district she serves, take her out - it's the only thing you can do!
 
Respectfully yours,

Governor, please take immediate actions to prevent the possible transfer 
of the 46th Test Wing from Eglin AFB and NW Florida to California.

The test mission at Eglin is a unique national asset that should not be 
discarded.  The 46th Test Wing employs almost 4000 highly skilled voters 
and tax payers who may leave government service if pressured to trade 
homes in NW Florida for jobs in California's Mojave desert.

There's a plethora of reasons why keeping the 46th Test Wing at Eglin is 
good both for Florida and for America.  Mr Governor, please do whatever 
you can.  As a registered voter, I will monitor your actions on this 
matter closely.

It was learned today that if the proposed move of Eglin's 46th Test Wing to Edwards in approved, the Air Armament Center, that designs and develops our weapons, will remain at Eglin.
 
Does it make sense to dismantle the best weapons test range in DoD, and then pay to rebuild it 3,500 miles away from where D&D takes place?  I urge you to fight to keep this total cradle-to-grave capability right where it is - at Eglin!  There is no way to calculate all the hidden costs not being discussed that this proposal would generate.

Back in the early 90's he murdered in cold blood my wife's cousin in hillsborough county fl. He only served a total of 1.5 years in state prison and got out. I dont understand how this has been happening and how justice wasnt served. He roams the streets freely and now has an opportunity to stay in this country! I dont believe this is fair at all because he took someone away from his family, friends and most importantly his kids! PLEASE RECONSIDER THIS PARDON MATTER!

I would like to know when you are going to be in the St. Petersburg area again so I can meet you and list to you on how you are going to help us homeowners of middle to lowincome;to pay for our HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. 
Tom Gallagher sent me a letter to go online at www.fmap.org and this is what they said :
 
Dear Terence Coffey, 
Thank you for submitting your property insurance quote request for 
 10498 VALENCIA RD,  
 SEMINOLE, FL 33772 7509 
 PINELLAS US 

to the Florida Market Assistance Plan (FMAP).  

We will do our best to match your request with licensed Florida agents that MAY be able to provide you an offer of coverage.
WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM AT ALL.!!!
 
We also tried the www.fldfs.com they told me to call the Florida Surplus lines service office in Tallahasse and this is what happened:
I have talked to 3companies TODAY about getting a quote. My insurance expires on Aug. 16. 2006. I received these names from Matt through the Flordia Surpluslines Service Office in Tallahasee today. None of the companies would insure our home because of the age of our house bulit in 1959. It is in very good shape,, we have Class A Hurricane shutters, we live in a non-evacuation zone, we have flood insurance, our roof is only 8 years old, and we used water proof primer and painted our house down 4 inches past the dirt line last year. If we have to pay $3000. for insurance this year, when we paid $924.00 last year, and we have never put in for a claim, I think we will be looking for another state to move to. 
We heard on the News about the TradWinds Resort Insurance and all THe Beach Hotels, if florida loses them; THEN WHAT???? WE NEED SOMETHING DONE NOW!!!! AND MAKE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PAY BACK THE OUTRAGES PREMIUMS THAT OTHER PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE PAID OUT.
 
Here are other people speaking out on the www.hurrican/tboblogs.com website if you would like to read more.

My wife and I are just starting out. We have college degrees and our in our respective carrers. We work for the second largets TV retailer in the world. 
We cannot afford to buy a house. But I can afford to spend 1100 a month on rent. 
Why can’t I afford a house? Greedy Flippers, insurance, upkeep, and propety taxes. 
I sleep better knowing I don’t own a house. I am happy to rent. I might be ‘throwing my money away’. But I am also not worried about having to move because of a 3,000 dollar insurance payment I can’t make or crazy property tax increases from a goverment who simply doesn’t care. All they want is their piece of your pie. 

Good luck to you all. I’m off to enjoy the spa at my apartment complex.

It was the school board, City, County than wanted to tap into the “Fiscal Year 2006-2007 Final Budget”. Governor Jeb Bush was forced to sign a $73.9 billion budget and $6.4 billion in reserves, in the guise of “state priorities” from the demanding of providing quality education, from the teachers union / school board alone. That alone will raise up our property taxes.  That’s why they did lobby down all bills. The costs the taxpayers / home owner’s are forced to pay that they don’t use for these socialist utopian benefits for public schools are astronomical. The teachers unions, with their overwhelmingly Democratic membership are tickled pink that Republicans are doing this unpopular work. The unions can blame the tax hike on Republicans and laugh all the way to the bank as they soak up the new revenue. City and county got their lump $um’s to. The trim notices come out in Sept. this year, watch everything go up afterward as well. We all need a “special session” in 2006.

The vast majority of the people who live in Florida do not understand how the insurance industry works or how our elected officials interact with corporate America.  Insurance companies are in it for profit. If you are willing to settle for an amount far less than the actual value the insurance companies will not fight you.  If the amount is moderate to large, they will fight and take advantage of you when you need the money.  Learn from those who are experiencing this situation after Katrina struck. Fire the elected officials if they do not support what the majority of the voters want! I sold my house due to rising costs and will be moving out of Florida.  Sunshine is nice, but it does not pay my bills and wages have not kept pace with increases!  I will not be doing business with Allstate or State Farm for any insurance needs in my new location due to the way they conduct their business.  They seem to think the funds set aside for claims is their personal treasure chest.

Our family just experienced the third rate increase in the last 20 months, this after being informed we were in a “safe” area and would not see another increase. The entire infrastructure seems to be in panic mode, and the working and middle class, everyone for that matter, is being pushed against the wall. After 17 years in the home, its time to go. Good riddance. House for sale in Oldsmar, send me an email. Not kidding

I live in Charlotte County and I'm hoping you will make the decision to remove Ms. Devos as Charlotte County Commissioner. She has shown us that she does not have to abide to any rules as far as living in her district. Is she above all that? I'm sure you will make the right decision. 
 
Thank-you for your time.

Subject:	Is Governor already left for Ireland? I pre-recorded a piece for Irish Language

radio today:
   
For:  Radio na Gaeltachta (RnaG)

Dear Governor:

The programme is supposed to be aired  Friday at 1.30pm Irish Time, (8.30am here) on an Irish Language Programme called An Samhradh Thoir, presented by Sean o hEalai on Radio na Gaeltachta in Gaelic.


I spoke about the State having the lowest unemployment figures in the country at 3%.
The dedication to Education, the recent Teacher of the Year Award and how thrilled the recipient is at the prospect of meeting the President later on.

The interest Mrs. Bush has in the Arts and the recent scholarships.  How she is a Catholic and that the Governor is a convert. 

That the Governor of Florida is deeply religious and truly a saint, a very fine person indeed.

The presenter tried to run down the President and said that isnt what people think of his brother the President,  but I finish by saying "not true",  they are both from the same deeply religious family,  so the two of them have to be the same,  just have to be the same.

The only Repulican to be elected as Governor for a second term ever.

That I do not believe that he will not run for President,  it was he who went out to inspect the devestation after the tsunamai.
(I do not know how much of above will be used as it was pre-recorded)

I hope you will run for President as after the case of Terri Schiavo we know that the Devil is alive and well in the United States and only you can run him out of the country.  I believe the prophesies have also stated that the Church will be under severe attack after the reign of this present Pope.

With 45 million Irish Americans in the country, the present President did not seem to look at his Irish roots and ancestors (former Irish President Erskine Childers supposed to be a distant relative?).  The Clans of Ireland's office where information can be got on our ancestors and surnames used to be located in the Taoiseach's office in Kildare Street, Dublin.

I was told by the presenter that you will be at the K Club so I hope you enjoy your Golf there.
As you will be in the Dublin area,  please do what you can to have them bring you to see the Church and the coffin of Matt Talbot who is very much the patron saint of Dublin.
As per my last email,  if you go to Southern Ireland,  see the Rock of Cashel perhaps go through a little town called BANSHA which was the parish of another great Irish hero, the late FATHER JOHN HAYES who founded the Irish Rural Organisation called Muintir na Tire. His family lived under bushes after being evicted from their home,  yet he went on to study for the priesthood, becoming a priest against all the odds.  If you should be able to go to Bansha  or anywhere in Tipperary please ask for and have a photo op eating a slice of Irish Soda bread and jam in memory of Father Hayes who said that in his poor starving childhood,  the greatest treat in the whole world that a child could get was a slice of bread and jam.  He even started a jam factory in Bansha.
The book on his life is just wonderful but I do not know if it still available.

Holy Cross Abbey,  Tipperary contains a portion of the true Cross.

Castles:
Rock of Cashel,  Cahir Castle,  Bunratty has within the grounds homes of the various type of Irish person from the past, and Dromoland is now a hotel and totally fabulous.

The bed in which Ann Boleyn (wife of King Henry 8th. mother of Queen Elizabeth 1st.) slept in when she was a young girl on vacation with the Butler family in South Tipperary, the owners of Cahir Castle,  is located in some big house in South Tipperary (I do not know which big house, but perhaps Tom Woods a guide at the Rock of Cashel may know).

In Dublin, Kilmaingham Jail is now a tourist center.  It was here that Grace Gifford married her sweetheart, the poet Joseph Mary Plunkett just hours before he was executed after the rebellion in 1916 when we got our freedom.
The song Grace has been made famous by the Irish Tenors.  De Valera, 2nd President of Ireland escaped execution unlike the 16 others because he was an American Citizen. 

Moore Street at the back of the General Post Office in O'Connell Street used always be an outdoor market where one heard a rich variety of Dublin accents calling out for customers to buy the fish, etc.

Visitors to Dublin must also eat fish and chips.  The best fish and chips in the world are supposed to be available in a shop up at the back of Dublin Castle,  near Christ Church Cathedral.

Somewhere near there in Fishamble Street, your wife will be interested to know that  Handel wrote the Messiah.  People do not know that it was written in Dublin when he visited there.
Irish Dancing:
6 Harcourt Street now houses Conradh na Gaeilge.  Downstairs is the only Irish speaking pub.  Upstairs on 3rd. floor is the office of The Irish Dance Commissio,  which governs Irish dancing all over the world.  This tiny office was once the office of Michael Collins who fell out with De Valera (details to be seen in the film Michael Collins).

I hope that above arrives in time or that you will be able to get your email while on the trip.  I hope that you have a wonderful time in my country.
Kind regards
Maire Peters

Good Morning Governor Bush

 

I am the 2004 Portage County Ohio Bush-Cheney Chair and am writing to make you aware of a solar panel project happening with Schneller, Inc of Kent, Ohio and Pinellas Park, Florida.  Following is a short description of the project and our request is for a representative (we were hoping you!) to be present at the ribbon cutting (date to be determined based on your schedule).

 

Schneller, Inc. headquartered in Kent, Ohio is the world leader in aircraft interior manufacturing and has facilities in Kent, Ohio, Pinellas Park, Florida and Paris, France.   I was fortunate to be part of the Schneller team for 8 year before coming to Home Savings Bank and am writing on their behalf.   

 

Schneller is in the midst of launching a new product line called Veritas ResinArt Panels.  Schneller is one of three global licensed manufacturers capable of using a patented technology that allows them to encapsulate materials in an environmentally friendly resin.  The resin contains up to 25% post industrial recycled content, contains no harsh chemicals and can be recycled.  The Veritas product line was introduced into the market place this past April at the Hospitality Design Expo in Las Vegas, has already won a “Best of NEOCON” trade show award in the architectural product category this past week in Chicago.  Veritas has already been featured in a variety of publications including the New York Times, Interior Design Magazine and Contract magazine to name a few.   Schneller has chosen the Pinellas Park, Florida facility as the manufacturing site of the Veritas product line.  They have already added head count to their manufacturing plant and expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.  They strive to be a green manufacturer and in conjunction with this product line have announced plans to install photovoltaic roof solar panels. They have teamed up with Solarpath Energy Systems of Miami, Florida to design and install the panels at the Florida facility.  These panels will greatly reduce dependence from the power grid and reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the environment. Schneller anticipates these panels will be installed by the end of June and would like to hold a “Flipping On The Switch” ceremony in July with as many local public officials as possible.  A firm date has not been set for this ceremony allowing the date to be adjusted based on the schedule of the Governor’s office.  

 

Any assistance you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Good for Florida – good for Ohio.  Thanks much in advance.

Dear Governor Bush, 
I'm writing you to appeal the denial of my daughter for a 
Bright Future's Scholarship. My daughter, Megan Lester, was denied Bright Future's Scholarship because she had neither foreign language nor the correct English class. 

I'm a colonel in the United States Air Force, retiring this fall after 30 years of service. I have been a Florida resident since attending Florida State University in 1971, where I received my undergraduate and graduate degrees. I have been stationed overseas consecutively since 1996 when my daughter was in the fifth grade. She attended middle school in Belgium and graduated from high school in Australia, where she attended the preeminent private school in the country. Megan has always been an outstanding student, as evidenced by her 3.8 grade point average at Gulf Coast Community College in Panama City. The one "B" she's gotten in three semesters was in her drama class. She scored an 1160 on SAT's and 26 on the ACT's. Megan took all the English classes appropriate for Australia, but could not take a foreign language due to the fact that Australians take primarily Asian classes which are started in elementary school. There were no beginning language classes available to high school students. Megan has however, completed three college semester classes of Spanish. 

Sir, the entire process has been very frustrating. We first applied for the Bright Future's Scholarship over a year ago and the application was lost. We reapplied and were told that we needed to go to a professional company to have Megan's Australian grades interpreted into American standards. After a lengthy process it was denied based on the fact that Megan did not meet the proper English or language requirements. 

Sir, we appreciate your time and attention in this matter.  Of note, while I have no proof, I think that my wife and I were the Florida absentee balloters that got your brother elected president.

Sincerely, 
RICK W. LESTER, Colonel, USAF

Hello Governor Bush, I enjoyed hearing you speak to the Just Read, Florida leadership conference on Monday. Thank you so much for all of your diligent efforts to improve the lives of children with their education and hopes for a bright future. I am a Principal at Lost Lake Elementary school in Lake County. We are very proud to be the largest elementary school, 1428 students and growing daily in Lake County and have the highest test scores and AYP for 2005-2006! We are a Five Star School as well.  I invited you two years ago to our 9-11 Remembrance and you responded with a possibility, then the hurricanes came! You mentioned visiting 250 schools and I am inviting you to come to our 9-11 Remembrance ceremony on Monday, September 11th. It is a parent, community, school ceremony with many community leaders, service men and women speaking, students singing a school written song in tribute to 9-11. Children read poetry and sing patriotic songs. Our staff would be very honored with your visit. This is an annual tradition so that we will always remember this tragic day and the reasons for protecting our precious country. Our ceremony takes place in our school courtyard at 9:00a.m. until 10:00a.m. although we could work around your schedule.

 

I hope to hear from you soon.

Dear Governor Bush, 
Thank you so much  for calling the Quinones's family, after the death of their daughter Marisselle. She was a very special young patient that touched my heart in many ways. She was the first special needs child that request to attend a school dance and was told that the special needs students were not invited to the dance so she called me her Mother and her CMS nurse. After a few talks with the school she was allowed to purchase a ticket to a school dance was the first Special Needs student to ever attend one of their dances. After that she was invited to be on a teen group that met each week.  These are just two situations that she open the doors for future Special Needs Children

Dear Governor:

I just got an email from Irish Radio letting me know that you are going over to Ireland on Friday.  As usual, I will have nothing but the greatest praise for you.  I do not know if you will get this before you leave, I hope so.

If you have any special message or even a little greeting for the Irish speaking public, I will be thrilled to pass it on for you via radio.

I hope you get to meet  Eamon o Cuiv, the grandson of the late  President De Valera who is a great hero of mine.  In his early 20's he left his very comfortable lifestyle in Dublin and went to work and live in Connemara at a farmers co-op so that the Irish Language speaking people there would have a better life.  We call him  Young Dev.

It would be wonderful if they could bring you to either see the coffin of  Matt Talbot or the Laneway where he died on his way to Mass.  He will eventually become a saint.  He came from a very poor family and worked at a mill.  In his younger days he drank a lot and is now the saint that people pray to for their families who have addictions.  He is very much the patron saint of Dublin but he let me down badly when he let Terri Schaivo die.

You will probably see the General Post Office in O'Connell Street, Dublin where the fighting took place in 1916 and as a result we got our freedom.

Knock, Co. Mayo is where the Blessed Virgin was said to appear on the Gabel End of the Church there.  

Holy Cross Abbey in Tipperary has a portion of the True Cross on display.  It is tiny but you can actually see it.

Holy Cross Abbey is not far from the Rock of Cashel  where my ancestor,  King Brian Boru, the King of Munster. (from Ahearne, brother of King Brian Boru who had a son called Floinn and his son was Raith from whom my grandmother's family, The McGraths are descended).  My ancestor Bishop Miller McGrath is buried on the Rock of Cashel).  Close to the Rock of Cashel, as you approach it from Dublin and look down to the right, that land belongs to Vincent O'Brien the famous race horse trainer where JR Ewing (Larry Haggman) and other famous people have their horses trained.
I do not know if our greatly loved prime Minister Bertie Ahearne knows that King Brian Boru, King of Munster, who was killed at the battle of Clontarf in 1014 had a brother called Ahearne?

Famous Dublin Characters:   Forty Coats (A vagrant).  Old Bang Bang ran from Church to Church saying Bang Bang both in the 1920's.

Molly Malone one of Dublin's best known songs...a ficticious character, a fish seller:  "she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow".

Dicey Riley:  another song about a ficticious person: 

"Poor Auld Dicey Riley, she has taken to the sup,
Poor Auld Dicey Riley,  she cannot give it up,
It's off each morning to the hop, then she pops in for another little drop.

The relatively new sculpture near Trinity College is nicknamed "The Flousie in the Jaccouzi".

If you land in Shannon,  they may take you to Dromoland Castle home of the O'Brien Chieftain, Conor O'Brien, Lord Insequin.  (Some of the family were called Heffernan and Quinn,  thus the town in Co. Clare called Quinn and thus the title Lord Insequin).
The Blind Poet Liam Dall O'Heffernan, of the Lord Insequin family wrote a poem Called Kathleen Ni hUallachain which became the secret name for Ireland and a painting of a woman called Lady Lavery depicted Kathleen Ni hUallachain on the old Irish Pound Note now out of circulation,  you will be using Euro coins now.  If Mrs. Bush is going with you,  this is somewhere she should see.  Very interesting but not as beautiful is the nearby Bunratty Castle.  If given a choice,  go to Dromoland Castle.

-------------


If there are any other Gaelic words that you need,  I will be thrilled to send them to you.  Every year in the past I called the White House Speech Writers Dept. and asked if they needed any words for your brother the President for his St. Patrick's Day speech and nobody ever called me back.

I hope you will really enjoy your visit to Ireland.

Subject:	46th Test Wing Relocation from Eglin AFB to Edwards AFB

Gov Bush- I am the proud spouse of a retired Air Force member who currently works with one of the civilian contractors who support the 46th Test Wing out of Eglin. I am deeply concerned with the articles in the paper regarding moving the test wing to Edwards AFB. The impact not just to our family and others but to the local business as well will be devastating. For starters if he loses his job we won't be able to afford our house payment along with thousands of others thus forcing us to try and sell which will in turn flood the market making it impossible for anyone to sell their home. Many people will probably have to file bankruptcy as they cannot afford to live in and support the local economy with the loss of those jobs. Those jobs are what brought the majority of these folks here in the first place.  This will also impact the schools which will impact the teacher’s positions, funding etc. since that is based on numbers of students.  Another thing that concerns us is the time frame-could they have made it any shorter? This is toying with people’s futures and puts people's lives in turmoil. When you have that many people involved it also hurts the job market/prospects that will be available.  Granted military will be moved but what about the rest of us? But even many of those military families own property here. I truly hope that serious consideration is given to impact that this decision has on our lives and futures here as well as the local businessmen who depend on our support year round.  The tourist industry does not support this area year round; it is we the "locals" who do this.  We are hoping that if enough people voice our concerns, maybe something can be done and you are one of the "go to people" we are hoping can help with this.   I look forward to your prompt response regarding this situation.

Eveyone on Eglin is scared to death.  This is a major defining moment for you as our Governor.  We are depending on you to help protect the mission of the 46th TW and keep it at Eglin where it belongs.  This is the most critical issue to hit our area in at least 50 years - much bigger than any hurricane.  The cost of rebuilding the infrastructure we already have in place, plus the hidden cost in the loss of invaluable expertise is not being calculated - and can not be.  This move would COST, not save.
 
Again, we're counting on you to make a stand for the thousands of us that will be directly impacted, as well as the millions that stand to lose if this nation's ability to defend itself is comprimised.

Subject:	U.S. Flag Code & Flag Etiquette

Dear Governor Bush:
 
     The United States Flag Code specifies that the Flag is to be flown at half-staff in mourning for designated principal government leaders and upon Presidential Order.
 
 
     In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any
State territory or possession of the U.S., the Governor of that State, territory, or 
possession, may proclaim that the National Flag be flown at half-staff.  And, that
ONLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR A STATE GOVENOR HAS THE
AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE FLAG BE LOWERED TO HALF-STAFF.
 
 
     The National Flag Foundations (NFF) has issued guidance on this subject in order to preclude good-faith misunderstanding or abuse of the Flag Code and Flag Etiquette, both of which are all too often violated by Civilian and Government Officials.   For Example:  Janet Reno, while U.S. Attorney General, ordered the American Flag flown at half-staff in honor of several DEA Agents who had died. The Flag Code does not give her the authority to issue that Order.  In addition, the Mayor of Pittsburg, Pa., ordered Flags flown at half-staff to honor the victims of a plane crash.  A well itentioned gesture, for which no authority exists.
 
 
     The NFF points out that these 'GOOD-FAITH" misunderstandings are not to criticize or embarass anyone, but rather, to head off growing trivialization of this memorial salute, and to preserve the dignity and significance of flying the U.S. Flag at half-staff, and believe that proper respect for our Flag must be maintained, no matter the circumstances.
 
 
     I feel it is a violation of the Flag Code and Flag Etiquette when Sheriff Ed Dean of Marion County, orders the Flag flown at half-staff.  He recently ordered the Flag to half-staff upon the death of a retired Police Officer and has on similar occasions in the past,  without, to my knowledge, authorization from you, the Governor.  He and other Officials take it upon themselves to lower our Flag to half-staff without the proper authorization.
 
 
     It appears to me that remedial action pertaining to the proper Flag Etiquette and Flag Code needs to be addressed.
 
 
     Sincerely, 
 
     Phil Gilbert

Dear Governor Bush,

I've forwarded this letter regarding land usage not expecting an answser (or action), but simply out of frustration because of the lack of reponse from organizations that should be concerned, such as the Florida Wildlife Commission, Hernando County Environmental Coordinator, The Trust for Public Lands (TPL), etc, etc.

I understand that the land area in question is small and therefore relatively unimportant.  I understand that everyone seems busy and preoccupied these days.  What I do not understand is why so few public officials will respond to a private citizen whose only concern is the preservation of as much natural wildlife as possible.

Sincerely,

Carl Wittbecker

To Whom It May Concern:

Presently, I am a Legislative Assistant for Minnesota State Senator
Bill Belanger.  As you can see on my attached resume, I have worked
heavily in politics, fundraising and legislative policy.  Both my work
and academic experience in Washington, D.C., Boston and Minnesota have
allowed me to experience different facets of our American system.  I
would like to highlight a few of my accomplishments that would make me a
valuable candidate for any prospects you may have.

I am a graduate of Emmanuel College in Boston - with a major in
political science and a minor in government relations.  Working within
the state legislature in the Minnesota State Senate, I have developed an
extensive knowledge of the legislative process.  In addition to my
experience with the Minnesota Senate, I was a scholastic intern at the
Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C. during the 2000 Bush
campaign.  While in Washington, D.C., I assisted in planning the
Republican Attorney General's Association Fall Conference in
Williamsburg, Virginia sponsored by the National Rifle Association. 
Throughout all of this time I worked extensively with fundraising for
this organization and the 2000 Presidential race, as well with member
services and event planning.

After returning to Boston from Washington D.C., I worked in the
Governor's Press Office while completing my thesis on Campaign Finance
Reform.  Following this, I returned to Duluth, Minnesota for an
abstracting position with Arrowhead Abstract & Title Co, before my
current position with the Minnesota Senate Republican Caucus.

I am a highly motivated, energetic and well organized individual who is
seeking a change.  I have learned how to listen and communicate
effectively through my fundraising, strategic campaigning, media and
legislative experience.  I have worked and will continue to work long
hours to establish and complete goals.  I am willing to start
immediately, travel when needed and learn the facets of your cause.    

I would appreciate an opportunity to talk further with you about how my
skills might best meet your needs.  I am looking to provide any service
that is available with commitment and dedication and will guarantee to
work long and hard for the future good of  both the state and nation.  
I have enclosed a copy of my resume and references as well as two
pre-written recommendations that are available via mail or fax.  Feel
free to contact me with any questions or other information you may need.
 I look forward to hopefully meeting with you in the future.  Again,
thank you for taking the time and consideration.

I received a response to my letter to you from Amanda Quigley with information concerning the above.
 
Interestingly, I was not aware of the order, but is what I was going to suggest you do. 
 
I'd be very interested in being a member of this committee. I believe I would bring a lot of leadership, common sense, and good thinking to it.  The approach to the solution needs be a complete solution, and not bad aids and bailing wire. It must be a win win for the people of Florida as well as the Insurance Industry serving them. It must be a house built on a firm foundation and not as the present house of cards.
 
As you may know, my background in leadership is not just local,  but State wide and Nationally. It is outside the insurance industry as well as within. I'm past State President of the Florida Jaycees 19972/73 when that organization was truly a dynamic leadership group.
 
I believe the time is ripe to affect dynamic change which will serve our State well into the future.

July11, 2006
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to you again as a follow up of my letter last week.
 
I am asking you again for help with our town of Yankeetown. As you know, our town government has nearly collapsed do to the actions of our Mayor. In seven months of office, the mayor has made a shambles of our town. She has consistently pushed for a development in our town while ignoring regular town business. 
 
I have not spoken to anyone in town who is against anyone building “by-right”. The people are against the way in which this development has proceeded behind closed doors without any one’s open knowledge. It began with the town attorney Clark Stillwell doing work for the developers and billing the town without informing the Town Council. Also, Council member Helen Ciallella had a contract with the developers for a year before publicly disclosing the contract and recused herself from voting. She voted every time to pay attorney Stillwell’s bill knowing that items on the bill had to do with the developers. The mayor allowed her to continue to sit on the council without an explanation. The mayor lied to the council and citizens during a Dec. 19th meeting when she was asked about the development. She stated at the meeting that she didn’t know anything about it, but had met with the developers that day at attorney Stillwell’s office. 
 
The mayor has continued to push for the developers’ project at every meeting. She has pushed for the signing of”OTTED” to help the developers. She even brought back resigned council member to make a quorum so that she could push through a developers’ agreement for the developers. She refuses to listen to the majority of the citizens in town. She has caused numerous resignations from council, planning and zoning board, zoning officer, and long time employees. She removed town documents to another county and so that the zoning officer could work only on the developers project. Many citizens requested to view these documents but were not given access to these documents.
 
 She has filled two of the five council seats and if you allow her to appoint at this time she will have filled four of the five seats. This would leave the town without a democratically elected council.
 
 Please give the people a voice in their government through an election for the vacant seats.
 
Sincerely,
Mary Pate

 INVITATION TO GOVERNOR BUSH
 
July 10, 2006
 
Governor Jeb Bush
Plaza Level 05, the Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am sending you this letter as an invitation to the Capitol Fellowship Breakfast hosted by The Christian Leadership Council, Inc., on Tuesday, November 21, 2006, 7:00 am, at the Tallahassee Civic Center.  The Christian Leadership Council is a non-profit, non-lobbying 501(c)(3) organization whose purpose is to minister to Florida’s key leaders with the message of Jesus Christ.  As you will recall, Dr. Ravi Zacharias was our guest on April 4, 2006.  Since the legislature will meet in organizational session and conduct swearing-in ceremonies, the leadership team felt this was an excellent opportunity to minister to returning and new governmental leaders and their families.  We especially would like to have you there to express our appreciation to you and to assist in the program with welcoming new governmental leaders to the Capitol. The Civic Center has been reserved for the morning of November 21st at which time there will be provided a  breakfast, a short musical program, and a guest speaker for incoming governmental leaders.  It would be our honor to have you attend and be a participant on the program.  The program will consist of prayer, Scripture reading, introducing speakers, opening remarks, and welcoming remarks.  If you will do us the honor of attending, you may decide what part of the program you would like to do.  
 
As of this date, the invited guest speaker to the Capitol Fellowship Breakfast is Actor Jim Cavaziel of The Passion of the Christ directed and produced by Mel Gibson.  There are several reasons why he was selected, among them include, he is a man with a powerful story to tell; he is not an extremist nor politically biased; and his part in this movie captured the attention of audiences all over the world.  
 
Mr. Tim Ireland is chairman of The Christian Leadership Council, Inc.  He is a former representative having served fourteen years in politics and ran for two State-wide offices.  He has a heart and mission to serve legislators through his ministry of presence, Bible studies, prayer breakfasts, and special events.  He joins a core group of representatives and senators who meet regularly in the Capitol for prayer and fellowship. The Christian Leadership Council is not affiliated with any other group or denomination, but strives to ministry to those who want to find the Lord or grow closer to our Savior Jesus Christ.  While the Capitol Fellowship Breakfast will be the first of its kind, The Christian Leadership Council has hosted special events before such as assisting with Rick Warren’s visit to Tallahassee, a luncheon with Coach Bobby Bowden, and a dinner event with Ravi Zacharias, a Christian Apologist and international speaker.  
 
We look forward to hearing from you regarding your participation in the Capitol Fellowship Breakfast on Tuesday, November 21, 2006, 7:00 am, at the Civic Center.   I would like to follow-up this letter of invitation with a phone call to discuss more details with you or answer any questions you may have.  You may return email confirmation of your willingness to attend and if you would like to be a part of the program.  I am also listing my phone number if you chose to communicate in that manner.  Thank you for considering The Christian Leadership Council’s invitation to this function.  We are looking forward to serving you and members of the legislature in the near future.
 
God Bless,

Subject:	Nomination of Mike Gotschall for Circuit Court

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Thank you for your consideration of my husband, Michael Gotschall, for a possible appointment to the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court in Seminole County.  No doubt you have heard from his many supporters of the high caliber of his professional qualifications and I would wholeheartedly agree with those endorsements.  I would also like to add my support from a more personal perspective.

 

Mike and I have known one another since graduating from high school twenty-four years ago and have been married to each other for the past fifteen years.  We have the privilege of raising seven children together and from this vantage point, I am witness to my husband’s true character.  Mike is a man of genuine integrity and compassion; someone who is completely committed to serving others.  Over the years, I have seen Mike sacrifice his personal time and use his legal expertise and knowledge to lend a hand to individuals in the community who were unable to help themselves.  He has made himself available on countless occasions to assist others not only with legal issues, but with technical computer problems as well.

 

Having a background in the legal field myself, I have observed many attorneys at work.  Rarely have I encountered anyone with such a broad base of knowledge in the various disciplines of the law which he possesses.  Mike’s passion is helping folks resolve conflict in the least contentious way possible.  He is a certified mediator and an arbitrator.  He has a proven record of service and commitment to this community.

As his wife, I may be slightly partial in my assessment of Mike Gotschall, but as a citizen and lifelong resident of Florida, I would be proud to have him serve on the circuit court.  I believe Governor, respectfully, you would be hard-pressed to find a candidate as qualified as my husband.  Thank you for your careful consideration of his nomination.

 

Respectfully yours,

Hi Governor,

I wanted to compliment you on your remarks at the leadership conference yesterday.  I know it wasn't a major address, but I thought the points you made were good ones for that audience.  It really is amazing what has been accomplished in the area of reading during your tenure as governor. I thought you might take a little pride in the following press announcement from FSU, since FCRR played a very important role in getting this grant, and since FCRR will be part of your permanent legacy for reading in Florida.

If you have any time later this summer or in the fall, we would love to have you visit FCRR. We now occupy about 22,000 square feet in the City Centre Building, and with all our center and faculty grants, we employ about 160 staff and students.  You could get a very good idea of all that we are involved in, and get a good idea of the space, in about an hour.  You would also have an opportunity to meet our senior staff and faculty.

Best,

Joe Torgesen

NIH TURNS TO FSU FOR TOP RESEARCH ON LEARNING DISABILITIES

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida State University has been awarded a $6-million grant from the federal government over five years to fund research efforts aimed at more effectively understanding, predicting and preventing the development of learning disabilities such as dyslexia in children, it was announced today.

The grant will fund the creation of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Multidisciplinary Learning Disabilities Center at FSU. The center, which will be one of only four in the nation, represents the NIH's flagship research program for learning disabilities.

Dyslexia is a learning disorder marked by impairment of the ability to recognize and comprehend written words. Although once thought of as visual disorder, scientists now know that the condition's manifestations - misspellings, reversing letters and words, even writing backwards - spring from an inability to recognize sounds, not visual cues.

"Many kids with reading disabilities really aren't identified until the second grade," said Richard K. Wagner, FSU's Alfred Binet Professor of Psychology and a Distinguished Professor of Psychology. As the principal investigator for the NIH grant, he will oversee the work of the Multidisciplinary Learning Disabilities Center.

The center will enable FSU researchers to conduct behavioral and genetic studies involving thousands of Florida children with dyslexia. The center will be an arm of FSU's Florida Center for Reading Research (www.fcrr.org), which was itself established in 2002 as a cornerstone of Gov. Jeb Bush's "Just Read, Florida!" initiative to have all schoolchildren in the state reading at their grade level by the year 2012.

"Our hope is to develop ways of diagnosing dyslexia and other learning disabilities at a younger age so that these children have greater chances of leading a happy, productive and successful life," Wagner said. "And it's a phenomenal opportunity for FSU because we will get to participate in the NIH's premier research into dyslexia."

Wagner said the center will conduct several studies involving large numbers of volunteers. In one of these, FSU researchers will identify a sample of 500 Florida families with members who have severe reading problems. In addition to educational and psychological testing, DNA samples will be taken from the volunteers to examine possible genetic components of their learning disabilities.

FSU also plans to perform a large-scale study of twins.

"We will be searching for 9,000 sets of twins from throughout the state," Wagner said. "After we identify them, we will seek parental permission to access their school records. Specifically, we will be looking for variability in their reading skills."

In addition to Wagner, nearly two dozen faculty members and post-doctoral researchers from FSU's departments of psychology and communication disorders, College of Education, and Florida Center for Reading Research, as well as four molecular geneticists from the Yale University School of Medicine, will participate in five major research projects under the NIH grant.

"For more than 20 years, Rick Wagner has been a leading scholar in the areas of learning disabilities, dyslexia and cognitive psychology," said Joseph K. Torgesen, director of the Florida Center for Reading Research. "I am delighted that he will have the opportunity to put his expertise to use in overseeing such important research into the study of dyslexia."

The Dyslexia Research Institute ( www.dyslexia.com/faq.htm) estimates that from 10 percent to 15 percent of the U.S. population has dyslexia, yet only five out of every 100 dyslexics are recognized and receive assistance. The institute also states that approximately 60 percent of individuals diagnosed with attention deficit disorders (ADD) also are dyslexic; however, their learning and language differences often are unrecognized because only the behavioral aspects of ADD are addressed.

My notary application has been denied by Jeb Bush, according to Heather Slager. I cannot get a reason from Heather or from the agency in Orlando that processed my application. I have been granted clemency, re-instating my civil rights by Jeb Bush and a full pardon is underway. The investigation is complete, nothing in my file to prevent a FULL pardon, according to Jeff Davis, Florida Parole Commission. All of this documentation was included in the FedEx package with my application on March 31.
 
I have left many voice mails and sent many emails requesting to speak to a person. Will you please call me at 321-436-7718? If not, please refer me to the appropriate person that I may speak with.

Thank you for contacting the Governor’s Notary Section!  Since the appointment of a notary is a discretionary act, there are no set criteria to guarantee a notary appointment.  (Please refer to section 117.01, Florida Statutes)  Additionally, the Governor does not give reasons for appointing or denying anyone an appointment.  You can either reapply for a commission or write the Governor's General Counsel requesting reconsideration at the address below.  Again, there is nothing that can be done to guarantee a notary commission appointment.

Heather, On March 29 I submitted my notary application electronically through Florida Notary Service. I have still not received my notary stamp. When I call Florida Notary, they refer me to the State. When I call the State, they refer me to Florida Notary. Today I spoke to Doris and MaryAnn, both with the State, who referred me to you. How do I check the status? There is nothing online. Thanks.

Subject:	Committee on Hurricane Insurance

Governor Bush,
 
As you are painfully aware, insurance, especially homeowner's insurance is a hot topic for the residents of Florida.  As I'm sure you also know, CITIZENS INSURANCE made significant strides from 2004 to 2005.  Depending on one's location in the state one may or may not agree with this assessment.  My perspective is a unique one, as I was running Catastrophe Operations for CITIZENS for the 2005 Hurricane Season, for the Director Rick Larson.  As of April 30th, I moved home to League City TX.  In doing so, I have started an independent adjusting firm, but find myself drawn to the politics of the insurance industry.
 
I am currently assisting a candidate for Insurance Commissioner of another state.  After recently reading about the Commission you just formed, I thought I might offer some insight from a perspective the appointed group might find helpful.  If you or any members of your newly appointed committee have an interest in discussing such matters, please feel free to contact me via e-mail or phone.
 
Thanks and God Bless,

To the Honorable Jeb Bush;

 

Thank you for all you’re doing to save the 46th Test Wing, and I emphatically encourage you to double your efforts to keep this critical asset at Eglin, where it belongs.  Please remember that both the security of our nation, and the jobs and lives of thousands of professionals and technicians, hinge on the outcome of this decision.  You don’t replace 3,500 or more high tech positions with 200 wage-grade jobs and have a resulting “wash” job-wise, as is being promoted by the proponents.

 

Please keep in mind that the figures showing monetary savings do not tell the whole story.  One of the many aspects of such a move that isn’t shown in the figures will be the increase in costs passed on to the Government by vendors and support groups of weapons that have located offices and plants within close proximity of Eglin.  For example:

 

The management and support team for the GPS “GYPSI” project is located in Melbourne, FL, and members drive up from there for testing on a regular basis.  If testing is moved out west, they would be required to make regular cross-country flights to California.

 

Also, the management office for the Hellfire missile test project is located at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.  Just two weeks ago that team drove about six big trucks down to Site C-7A to begin work on an upcoming test.  To provide the same support out west would require a massive cross-country trip of several days instead of one.

 

There are dozens and dozens of other established links to the Eglin area also that are not reflected in the financial justifications also, plus the cost of rebuilding what we already have!

 

Keep fighting for us Governor Bush.  Now is not the time to move this critical function within range of North Korean missiles, or to disrupt the flow of weapons development.  Also keep in mind that ONLY Eglin offers three routes of access for test – the Gulf, the Atlantic and by land.  All three are used, especially in Cruise missile testing.  Edwards can’t provide but two, nor does it have our massive Gulf Test Range for large-scale supersonic testing.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to indicate my support of Rob Turner for this appointment.  Mr. Turner has taken an office that was extremely backward, with an aversion to the use of available technology, and brought it to a high level of competence in a relatively short period of time.  He has done this without politicizing the office of Property Appraiser, as many others have done previously.  The assessments in this county are far more believable than they have ever been and do not overtly favor groups of individuals.  I think that he is a very competent person, as well as a good leader who runs his office very smoothly.   I am certain that he would be a stellar addition to any group that is dealing with property tax and assessment issues.

 Governor Jeb Bush and Cabinet,
 
 I'm writing you this letter to plea, beg for mercy, and bestow to you my broken heart. My son, Taylor Wells, remains incarcerated at Sumter Correctional Institute. I know you have received many letters and pleas from citizens requesting his release. Our family is aging and there has been health problems and emotions of loss. The story of my son's incarceration are not for a deed that his hands or thoughts conceived. Taylor has wanted from the beginning of this 13 year nightmare to always show his and our families remorse and ask forgiveness that he had any entrapment with the accused people at all. Please again read the story The Story of Taylor G Wells  One Night for Life And allow us a chance to have my son home and our family to be filled with hope. If there is any way that we can assist the Victim's family in their grief or the State in preventing a tragedy such as this, We will. Our entire family, friends and spiritual community has felt this loss. We want to make amends and have a reason to lift up our hearts and heads. Please feel our sorrow and pain. Commute Taylor's sentence. Now is the time, It will be the right thing to do.

Re:       URGENT - For the Town of Yankeetown's Welfare 

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

My name is Laura Coyle.  I was the Deputy Clerk for the Town of Yankeetown for 3 ½ years. I resigned on June 15, 2006.   Our Town is in desperate need of your help.  I know you have had many calls, letters and emails in reference to this plea but everyone in Town has been asking me to contact you to see if you will allow me to at least go back into the Town Hall to get the Water Department back on its feet again. 

 

New people that have arrived in Town or have sold their homes can only get their water connected or discounted if they know Mayor Joanne Johannesson or one of her friends.   People that have also left are not getting their water deposits returned back to them.  Renters have up to $150.00 on file with the Town and these people are need their deposits returned to them so they can get new utilities hooked up. Water bills have not gone out since 5/30/06.  I can not imagine what the mail looks like.  People have been sending payments in since 6/16/06.

 

I have full knowledge of the water billing cycle.  Payments can be posted and then deposited into our water account fund.   This fund then pays the Towns bills and some payroll.  The Mayor only has to get one other signature on the bank accounts to do this.   There are two members left on our Council or I can be a signature as the Town Clerk once was.

 

I have also faxed and emailed Mr. Nate Adams.

 

Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon.

Subject:	Urgent, The Loss of Eglin AFB's 46th Test Wing and the Proposed Immediate Closure of the McKinley Climatic Laboratory!

Dear Governer Bush
 
    I am writing to you asking you for your immediate assistance in a matter of utmost importance and urgency.      
    As you may already be aware, there is a movement in the Air Force to shut down some of Eglin AFB's facilities and transfer most, if not all of Eglin's 46th Test Wing and it's mission from Eglin AFB in Florida to Edwards AFB in California.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  
    As you may also be aware, the attempt at siphoning off Eglin's mission and it's assets and having them transferred to Edwards is not a new one.  This has been a reoccurring attempt for several years now.  What is different about this time and this event is the underhanded and back-door way in which this has taken place. 
    They have sneaked this up the ladder and gained Air Force approval without the Test Wing, or the Test Wing's contractors knowledge or being allowed in on the discussion. 
    For these facilities to be shut down and for the Test Wing's mission to be moved to Edwards would devastate this area's economy. 
    While I am concerned for the welfare of my local area, the future of Eglin and the long-term growth of this area, my immediate concern is for my job at one of the facilities that have been targeted for immediate closure. 
    Although you may be aware of this attempt to move the 46th Test Wing, you may not be aware however, that there are three facilities located at Eglin that have been targeted for immediate closure.  Those are the McKinley Climatic Laboratory (Climatic Lab), the Pre Integration of Munitions and Electronics faciltiy (PRIMES) and the Guided Weapons Evaluation Facility (GWEF).  
    They have been targeted to be shut down by October 1 of this year (2006).  From what I have been told, the decision to shut down these facilities is going to occur sometime in early August.  These actions have only been brought to the public's attention this past Friday (July 7th) via an article that was published in the Northwest Florida Daily News of Fort Walton Beach, Fl.  This is merely days away from being decided.  It is not an understatement to say that this is very alarming and requires your immediate attention.  
    The decision to permanently close these facialities is a grave one.  As you may already be aware, the McKinley Climatic Laboratory is a one of a kind facility that is unique, not only to the Air Force, but to the entire world.  The capabilities of this facility alone cannot be duplicated anywhere else in the world and it would a national tragedy to lose that unique capability. 
    Not only is the Climatic Lab a national asset and an asset to the Department of Defense, but is a profitable asset to the Air Force, Eglin, and the 46th Test Wing.  The Climatic Lab has a testing schedule of customers fully booked for the next two years with an extremely heavy work load projected for the next 5 years.  There is also, already in place, a 30 million dollar contract with the Air Force and Raytheon to test the ACM/ALCM six times a year for the next 24 years here at the Climatic Lab.  The Climatic Lab's customers are not only DoD (Air Force, Army and Navy) and DoD contractors such as Raytheon, but companies such as Ford, Chrysler, Pratt & Whitney, Bombardier and more than several civilian aircraft companies that are all regular and repeat customers of the Climatic Lab also.  With the permanent loss of facilities such as the Climatic Lab, where else will these customers go?  It would appear that no one at the decision level cares what happens to these customers.  A cavalier attitude such as that canot be tolerated in any enterprise, much less in the United States Air Force.  
    From what I understand, the rational being used to promote this agenda at this attempt, is that the Air Force needs the money to buy aircraft and "realigning" Eglin would allegedly accomplish this task.  However, this reasoning only sounds like the latest excuse to legitimize the attempt at the siphoning off of Eglin's missions and assets.  As stated earlier, this is not the first time this has been attempted. 
    There are plenty of legitimate arguments for not allowing this to happen.  Many of them are economic and budgetary.  It just doesn't make economic sense to permanently close these facilities, lose their capabilities forever and move these missions to Edwards where operating costs are staggeringly higher there at Edwards than here at Eglin.  
    The personnel, the infrastructure, the capabilities, the weapons research and the facilities are already in place at Eglin AFB.  It doesn't make economic or budgetary sense to destroy that. 
    The 46th Test Wing and it's facilities have recently been scrutinized and have survived BRAC.  It has survived BRAC because it was determined that the Test Wing and all of it's facilities are an asset to the Air Force and the Department of Defense and it would not be cost effective to relocate or close any part of it's existing mission.  Being that the BRAC determination has alredy and recently been made, then why now is this attempt to dismantle Eglin AFB being made?    
    It does not make sense for the Air Force to make a decision of such short term economic gain at the cost of permanently destroying in-place capabilities, resources, personnel and facilities.  
    Once again, sir, I cannot adequately express the gravity and the immediacy of this situation.  My job and my immediate capability to provide for my family is in immediate jeopardy.  I am pleading for your help and assistance in this utmost important and urgent matter.  Thank you.

Dear Jeb, 

My name is Michael Pirozzi and I don't know where else to turn. I have been arrested twice on felony drug possession.  I have had my rights restored but I am having a hard time finding employment.  Everyone does background checks and it is very difficult for me to find a permanent full time position.  Is there a way for me to go back to court to get the charges reversed or have a new trial.  Anything to be able to get this permanent mark off my record.  It is like once you have been convicted of a felony you are not able to find a good job.  It's like there is no opportunity once you have committed a felony.  I was young, dumb and high, what did I care.  Now, that I have been drug free for ten years.  I am married, I have a daughter and everyday I wonder if I am ever going to be able to get past the stupid mistakes I made.  Everyone one deserves a second chance in life.  I got off drugs for myself, I was tired of living like that.  Now, I am trying to be a better person my wife and daughter can be proud of.  All I want is the same opportunity to provide for my family.  Every time I apply for a job and think I have it, when they run my background check, I never get the job.  I worked in the restaurant business the whole time I was using drugs and I do not want to get a job in that environment.  But, the restaurant business are the only companies not doing background check.  When I got off drugs and out of the restaurant business, I was able to get a job.  But, since then I got injured and was out of work and then after September 11 every company does background checks.  What qualification do you have to meet to get a pardon.  I don't know what else to do. Please help me, what can I do.

Dear Governor Bush, 
I am writing to you in support of the appointment of Louise B. Zeuli to the 18th Circuit Court Bench in Seminole County, Florida. 

I have known Ms. Zeuli for a period exceeding 12 years, having used her legal services in several matters.  I also assisted her with several cases in my professional capacity.  Both my wife, Sandy, and I were very impressed by Ms. Zeuli and found her to be extremely professional in all our legal dealings.  I distinctly remember being amused at the reactions of "the other side", being irked when Ms. Zeuli repeatedly found errors in their documents, due to their sloppy work.  We were quite satisfied on all occasions by her attention to detail and professional manner and congratulated ourselves with picking a great attorney to represent us. 

During my life, I have been privileged to meet several people I have described as "large souls".  These are men and women who live beyond themselves in the community of mankind; Louse Zeuli is one of these people.  Ms. Zeuli has participated in a large way with a variety of civic organizations, community groups, and beneficial charities.  She spends many hours involved with the Seminole County Legal Aid Society and assisting students at Seminole Community College.  Ms. Zeuli's years of experience as a Registered Nurse have also provided her with a unique perspective and a wealth of knowledge far beyond that of legal matters. 

In my many years, while serving as a juror on civil and criminal cases (I always get elected foreman), I have had the opportunity to observe many judges on the bench.  The traits I have admired in several judges, intelligence, fairness, common sense, and respect for the law, are all personified in Louise Zeuli.  I personally believe that she will make a fine addition to the Circuit Court bench and hope you will grant her appointment.

Dear Governor Bush,
    I am writing to you today to seek your services. I am a married mother of four children, an avid churchgoer at East Hill Baptist, a full-time student at TCC, a foster parent through the Florida Baptist Children's home and last but certainly not least, I am a Navy Reservist. This is the reason for my email today. For the past few years, the Naval and Marine Corps of Tallahassee has thrown what we like to call the Navy Birthday Celebration. This year we are having our celebration right down the street from you at the Holiday Inn East on Apalachee Pkwy. and we would LOVE to have you come and be our guest speaker!! The reservist's are a special breed, taking time away from families and jobs to protect this fine country and it would mean the world to them if you would be our guest speaker. Of course your wife, your brother, and your whole family is invited! I know this probably a long shot, but the answer is always no if you don't ask. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this email and consider my request. The date for our birthday celebration is October 7th from 7pm-11pm. If there is any time during this time that you could come by and speak to us, we would certainly work our schedule around yours. Thanks again.
 
Very Sincerely,
Petty Officer Helen A. Willis

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I am a visitor to your state of Florida. A Jamaican by nationality. I am so impressed by the beauty, organisation and friendliness of Florida and it's people. I feel as if i am home. I just want to congratulate you on the great job you are doing.
 
I do not know if you read your emails, but I believe that there should be special relationship between Florida and The Caribbean. Separate from the relationships that exist between the Caribbean and the US in General.
 
Elements of this relationship should be:

*	Technical Cooperation in all environmental and sustinable development matters.  There should be close linkages between your Government Agencies and ours, and between your NGOs and ours. Our strategies should have common elements coming out of mutual discussions.
*	Formal Small business linkages. This will assist in developing small businesses in the Caribbean which will benefit ourselves and the  state of Florida.
*	Youth Development initiatives aimed at incresing the education and viable skills of youth in the Caribbean.
*	Reviewing Governance  structures and developing effective alternatives. Florida's experience is extremely useful in this respect.

I am working with a new Caribbean not for profit organisation that would like to work with Florida in developing strategies to realise these intentions. I am hoping I will meet some relevant persons in your government that could jump start this process. 
 
I feel sure and the United States could benefit from your requisite wisdom and it is my hope that you will succeed your brother in the upcoming race.
 
In case you read this I am hoping that you will at least reply. All the best. May the Lord Jesus bless you.

It is entirely too difficult to get information through public records

consider that a compliment or not!  Examples of heavy handed tactics 
include odd calls like this:

Gestapo Agent: What is your name?
Me: Josh Kendrick
Gestapo Agent: Who do you work for?
Me: Blah blah blah
Gestapo Agent: Thank you. *hang up*
Me: Hello??

And then there's just the general asking all kinds of questions, 
delaying, making things sound harder to get than they really are, etc.

What's so important about most of this stuff that you need to keep such 
tight centralized control over it?  I think it's a huge waste of 
taxpayer money.  Any thoughts?

RE:  Ronald Neil Thompson

I have written several letters to you, since, November 3, 2005.  I am praying that I will hear from you and that you will check into my brother, Ronald Neil Thompson’s case BEFORE YOU LEAVE OFFICE.

As I have stated in previous letters.  Our brother Reginald Thompson has been on a mission for five (5) years together Ronald locked up.  Ronald and I have unsuccessfully appeared before several Officials in Duval County, 2001-2005 in an attempt to get an Injunction for Protection, case #01-2067 DV.

Reginald was finally successful and Ronald has been sentenced to 10 years to the Department of Correction (5 yrs of probation).  Ronald was under duress and had no choice but to enter a plea.  His Public Defender told him that if he did not accept the offer, the State Attorney would file a Habitual Offenders petition.  Ronald’s Public Defender also told Ronald, he did not stand a chance in a trial against the key witness, who admitted to receiving money from a family member in this case, because he is a Church Deacon, he is a retired school principal, he is well respected in the community, due to his community services.

ALSO, the attached PETITION filed in my brother’s case is not true, “having been convicted of a felon in the courts of the State of Florida to-wit; Escape, in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County, Florida on May 12, 1998”.  This is not true.  This is a William Thompson AKA Ronald Thompson DC #069189, (see picture and history).

Mr. Bush, I sent information to the clemency board and it has been returned, as it has not been two (2) years.  Please Mr. Bush, before you leave office, help me make a wrong right and give Ronald his life and freedom back.

RECORD NUMBER OF FLORIDIANS USING SAFETY BELTS

On Thursday I announced that a record number of Floridians are using
safety
belts. The Preusser Research Group recently reported that 80.7 percent
of
drivers and their front seat passengers are using safety belts on
Florida
highways.  Overall, safety belt usage rates in Florida have climbed more
than 20 percent since 2000. A vast majority of Floridians are using
safety
belts. Wearing a safety belt saves lives. It is the single most
effective
way to prevent injuries and reduce fatalities in motor vehicle crashes.

CHRISTA CALAMAS APPOINTED SECRETARY OF THE FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH
CARE
ADMINISTRATION

On Thursday I named Christa Calamas as Secretary of the Florida Agency
for
Health Care Administration (AHCA). Calamas most recently served as the
General Counsel for AHCA.  The appointment is effective July 8.
Previously,
she served as Assistant General Counsel to Governor Bush from 2002 to
2005.
Calamas replaces Secretary Alan Levine who was recently selected as the
new
CEO of the North Broward Hospital District. Christa's extensive
experience
in health care policy continues to be a great asset to my
administration. I
am confident Christa will continue the good work done by Secretary
Levine as
Florida implements landmark Medicaid reform, leads the nation in public
reporting of hospital information and begins the process of creating
networks for electronic medical records. All three of these priorities
will
fundamentally improve the way health care is delivered in our state. For

Here's an email we received at Eglin AFB prior to the release of the 
information that the 46 Test Wing would be moving to Edwards AFB.  What kind 
of legislation is this??  My tax dollars are funding this equipment so 
civilian corporations can come I and use it and not have to incur any of the 
cost to sustain these test facilities?  I didn't realize the DoD was in 
business to support private industry.at least that's not what my 30 years of 
military service taught me; this plan setup the fall of Eglin AFB as a test 
facility.  I firmly believe that decisions are made and then we make the 
numbers say what they need to say to justify the ends.  I've seen that 
recently with all the fact finding going on now to move Eglin to Edwards. 
First, you don't send the right people, and those that came were amazed at 
the REAL cost to move.but I'm sure they'll make the numbers work.  Have you 
ever thought of things like the extra environmental concerns, and who would 
even consider moving to Edwards (ever been there, I have, it's horrible!) 
Do the right thing, keep Eglin the world's best test facility and reverse 
this insane NDAA ruling.





Subject: NDAA Point Paper for Gen Riemer



All,



            Gen Riemer has requested a point paper on NDAA to support an 
upcoming meeting with the Florida Congressional Delegation.  Specific 
interest is on the Intent vs. Impacts of the NDAA language.



            I'd like to include several specific examples: GWEF, JPRIMES, 
McKinley, BISS, ASTTE/MSTTE, CIGTF, NRTF, King Hangar/CSAR-X as demonstrable 
cases.  Impacts on DLRs or the Flying Hour program may be considered if 
appropriate.





INTENT VERSUS IMPACT

OF

FY03 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT

(NDAA)

SUBTITLE D. SECTION 232:

OBJECTIVE FOR INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING

OF

TEST AND EVALUATION FACILITIES



PURPOSE:  Provide specific examples of the impacts to the 46TW as a result 
of NDAA 2003



BACKGROUND - NDAA INTENT:

-           Funding Objective (1) was to "fully fund" institutional and 
overhead costs of MRTFB activities through Major Test and Evaluation support 
and investment accounts (Program Element (PE) 65807 and 64759F for the Air 
Force), Central Test and Evaluation Investment Programs (CTEIP) (PE 64940D), 
and facilities restoration, modernization and sustainment PE'S (65976F AND 
65978F).

-           Funding Objective (2) was to insure that DoD elements would only 
be charged the direct cost for their use of MRTFB resources.

-           HQ/TE Guidance, MRTFB Customer Charging Policy, dated 1 October 
FY05 stated that costs supporting a single customer are to be considered 
direct costs.  Costs supporting multiple customers are generally considered 
indirect costs.

-           Intent was to ameliorate rising or fluctuating costs and produce 
stable rates within the MRTFB-provided services.

-           Congress provided no additional funding to implement the 
institutional funding mandate; within the Air Force, the primary source of 
funding was to direct transfer from the acquisition programs.





IMPACTS:

-           Charges to Commercial Customers were intended to include 
institutional and overhead charges under funding objective (2) of NDAA 2003. 
However, since the implementation of NDAA, most Test Group commercial 
customers have sought and obtained sponsorship letters from DoD 
organizations justifying use of MRTFB resources at the government rate, thus 
shifting those expenses from a reimbursable basis to internal, unit funding. 
The resulting impact to the 781TS, National RADAR Test Facility (NRTF), has 
been an unfunded bill for the indirect cost of tests performed for 
commercial customers.  For FY06 the shortfall amount is $1M.

-           Before NDAA, the 746 TS provided a week of GPS jamming 
environments during a semi-annual event known as "Jamfest" for a variety of 
customers.  Each customer was charged a $5K to $10K "entry fee" to use the 
GPS jamming environment, as well as any additional direct costs for their 
program.  Customer feedback showed Jamfest fulfilled a need for a low-cost 
way to test navigation and weapons system performance in the presence of GPS 
jamming.  However, as a direct result of NDAA, customer funds already 
received for Jamfest IV (scheduled for Nov 2006) were returned and the 746 
TS reverted to using limited, in-house funds to provide a reduced-scope for 
Jamfest IV and has canceled subsequent Jamfests.   Additionally, 
collaborative testing in general has become difficult to conduct because any 
cost common to two customers is not direct to either, and is therefore 
unfunded.

-           NDAA also prevents customers from paying for capability upgrades 
if that capability will eventually be used by another customer.  In the 
past, our overall test capabilities gradually grew due to investments made 
by specific customers to meet their needs that had residual value and use to 
later customers.  As a specific example, upgrades needed for the Joint 
Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) test can not be funded by the 
program under NDAA are currently not funded by any other source.  We are 
attempting to find other funding sources but the likelihood remains that 
test accuracy will be compromised.  Another example is the AT-38 rear 
cockpit instrumentation rack.  These racks used to be funded by the first 
customer to require it and available to all customers afterwards.  Under 
NDAA, this is no longer possible and all customers will suffer.

-           Under objective (1) of NDAA, customers can no longer support I&M 
efforts that could be utilized by multiple users at the MRTFBs.  As a 
result, MRTFBs have less flexibility and must utilize the Air Force Test 
Investment Planning and Programming (TIPP) for I&M efforts.  Unfortunately, 
the TIPP process was not modified to account for NDAA changes and is not 
flexible enough to accommodate testing timelines.  The impact is 
insufficient funds to cover I&M projects at the 746 TS.

-           NDAA drives the FHP.  Prior to NDAA we had a flying program that 
cost about $23M of which half was DBA and we earned the rest through RBA 
earnings through adjusting flying hour rates.   Under NDAA we cannot charge 
the customer other than direct costs, so a significantly higher percentage 
of the $23M must be paid for with DBA.  Because we have no real earning 
capacity any more a fully funded FHP is required.  The result is now we have 
to get requirements from customers a year out so we can get sufficient hours 
(dollars) allocated from AFMC.  We then have to build our test and training 
inside that budget.  If new customer test requirements arise during the 
year, we may have to turn them away - in the past we could have always taken 
on their work since they were paying.  So, even though Gen Martin was 
driving toward a FHP before NDAA, NDAA now demands operating on a FHP and 
significantly reduces test flexibility in the process.

-           Implementation of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 
of 2004 has created multiple unintended consequences for many ground test 
facilities and capabilities such as the Joint Pre-flight Integration of 
Munitions and Electronics Systems (J-PRIMES), Guided Weapons Evaluation 
Facility (GWEF), McKinley Climatic Laboratory, and Multi-spectral Test and 
Training Environment (MSTTE), Armament Systems Test and Training Environment 
(ASTTE), and Base Installation and Support System (BISS).

o          These facilities and capabilities provide unique test and 
training capabilities and capacity to ensure customer requirements are met

o          Prior to NDAA each facility and capability could charge indirect 
charges to customers to offset maintenance, utilities, supplies, 
enhancements, and upgrades thus reducing DBA requirements based on facility 
and business demand

o          Under NDAA these indirect charges can no longer be applied to DoD 
customers

o          RBA decreases due to inability to charge indirect costs to 
customers

o          Results in increased DBA requirements for FY07 and out years

o          Many customers are willing to pay indirect costs in order to keep 
these critical high-demand capabilities available; NDAA directly prohibits 
this.

o          All of these facilities, whose operation was fiscally sound 
pre-NDAA, are now at considerable fiscal risk despite a customer base 
willing to pay for access to the test resources offered, but who are 
prohibited from doing so under NDAA because the direct costs are not 100% 
attributable to a single customer.



SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION



Unfortunately the ground test facilities and capabilities are falling victim 
to a "Perfect Storm" scenario, wherein the provisions of the NDAA coupled 
with the established POM process produces difficult fiscal pressures.  With 
severe FY07 budget cuts outlined in PBD 720, and the inability to charge 
customers indirect charges, it is extremely unlikely that many of the above 
facilities and capabilities will remain viable.  This will have a severe 
impact on test range and facility customers.  If these facilities and 
capabilities were not part of the MRTFB and thus not under NDAA rules it is 
extremely likely the capabilities could remain viable and continue to 
support most of the facility customers at a reduced capacity despite budget 
cuts and PBD 720.



The implementation of NDAA, specifically the methodology to accomplish 
funding transfers to support the MRTFB, and the elimination of indirect 
charges to the customers, produces austere fiscal management pressures.  As 
an example, based solely on these fiscal parameters, it would be in the best 
fiscal interests of AFMC to completely divest of all possible MRTFB assets, 
discontinue funding, and avert any further funding transfers from the AF 
acquisition programs, and if capacity and access were not an issue, utilize 
MRTFB assets operated by the other services.  In this manner AFMC could 
redirect funds to other crucial areas, limit or eliminate transfers from the 
acquisition programs, and only be forced to fund the direct costs associated 
with mission-critical services previously provided by AFMC-operated 
components of the MRTFB.  This is a completely unrealistic scenario for 
obvious reasons (OSD and the other services would certainly strenuously 
object, corresponding transfers may be demanded, and capacity remains a huge 
issue), but it highlights the 'tendency limit' of a process.  These 
difficulties, of course, span the entire MRTFB.



In fact, to a certain degree elements of this scenario are already 
occurring, as AFMC (through institutional direct budget funding) is forced 
to subsidize a whole host of test and training customers whose parent 
organizations did not contribute to the operation and maintenance of the 
MRTFB infrastructure within AFMC.  The missions of the 'non-AFMC' users may 
be compelling and vital (AFSOC, 33rd FW, 53rd WG, AF and DoD training, 
etc.), however, these missions themselves are not within the AFMC core 
mission. The programming implications are clear and counter to our national 
defense interests with respect to the strategic maintenance of these MRTFB 
assets.



The core of the difficulty is that under the pre-NDAA business model, a 
complex fiscal strategy evolved wherein customers supported the MRTFB assets 
via demand for test range resources and services.  The complexity at Eglin 
is illustrated and compounded by the wide scope of customers supporting and 
utilizing the range.  Under NDAA, it is now extremely problematic for the 
services to adequately resource MRTFB assets because the budget transfers a) 
do not directly relate to a bottom-up MRTFB requirement analysis, and b) 
they rely on 'future test requirements' throughout the FYDP which are 
ambiguous at best and absent in other cases (example AF non-acquisition or 
other service test or training requirements and corresponding 
non-transferred funds).  This results in the 'owner' of the MRTFB assets 
assuming an increasing burden of subsidizing a significant percentage of the 
current and future test and training customers, with no clear resolution of 
this funding difficulty available under the existing rule-set (POM process 
coupled with NDAA).



If this situation persists and results in a reduction in overall MRTFB 
assets, the results could include AF and other service program delays, 
increased difficulty in meeting developmental and operational test 
requirements, difficult fiscal problems for maintenance of key MRTFB assets 
required by other range customers (cross service customers, training 
customers to include AFSOC, 325th, 33rd, and JSF as examples), and increased 
costs as direct budget saved in reductions is transferred via out-of-cycle 
costs to other sources and to prime contractors, who may absorb some of the 
capacity shortfalls.

Dear Governor Bush, 

 

I am writing you today asking for your immediate assistance on some disturbing news I have learned. The last two days there have been articles in the North West Florida Daily News about the closure and relocation of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida to Edwards Air Force Base in California.  I am a contracted civilian employee with Indyne Inc. and work at the McKinley Climatic Lab as a HVACR Mechanic/Operator.  In the paper today it shows that the McKinley Climatic Lab, Pre-Integration of Munitions and Electronics (PRIMES), and Guided Weapons Evaluation Facilities (GWEF) are scheduled to close on October 1, 2006.  This is the first step in moving or standing down of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin AFB, FL. The remainder happens over the next six years.  This process does not seem economical to me. It will cost MILLIONS to relocate the 46th Test Wing. I know that the Climatic Lab has the next two years booked with an extremely heavy work schedule projected for the next five years.  Also we have a $30 million contract with the Air Force and Raytheon to test the ACM/ALCM six times a year for the next 24 years. The word I received today from our Civil Service Director over the Climatic Lab is that the Air Force has stated that they do not care about the customers. They can find somewhere else to go!  A definite decision about our fate will be made around Aug. 1, 2006. These facilities of the 46th Test Wing have survived BRAC in recent history because it is not cost effective to relocate or close.  Why now is this happening?  Just three years ago there was a movement to shut down the Climatic Lab and the cost was around $20 million just to shut down a profiting facility.  There is no other facility in the world like the McKinley Climatic Lab. We service the military and the civilian world with the testing we do.  To lose the 46th Test Wing and some of its rare testing facilities could come at great cost not only to the local community but the entire country.  I cannot even imagine the ripple down effect that this situation will have on this community. What makes no sense to me is that the personnel, infrastructure, and capabilities are already in place at Eglin AFB, FL. It doesn’t make economical sense to destroy that, and destroy 1500 civilian jobs in the process.  

  I thank you for your utmost attention in this matter. I will be awaiting your reply on what you can do to help all of us with the 46th Test Wing.  

  You can reach me by Email at home 4nicebares@earthlink.net  or work jesse.barefield.ctr@eglin.af.mil . Thank you again for you time.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush:
 
I definitely think that you should give serious consideration to appointing Rob Turner, Hillsborough County Property Appraiser, to a position on the proposed "Property Tax Reform Committee"....  And I truly think that he should be the Chairman of the committee.
 
I have know Rob Turner for many years, even before he was selected as Hillsborough County Property Appraiser in 1996.  Since he took over as Property Appraiser, Hillsborough County's Property Appraiser's office has become extremely professional as you, I and the residents of Hillsborough County would expect from a true Republican.
 
I consider his re-election in 2000 and 2004 as total support of the citizens of Hillsborough County that he is performing his job in a highly professional manner with extreme integrity.
 
It is my position that you should be honored to have the privilege of appointing such a person as Rob Turner to such an important position.
 
With Kindest Regards.........

Dear Mr. Bush,                                                     

 

      I am an employee of the Operation and Maintenance contractor at Eglin Air Force Base.  I have worked on the contract for 22 years, supporting our military weapons testing and developing by rising as early as 2:00 A.M. and staying as late as 12:00 P.M., through freezing rain and boiling sun, missing many family outings, vacations and birthday celebrations, all in order to accomplish “the mission”.  I never complained through the years, though, because I always thought I was helping my country; this was my sacrifice and, even though I wasn’t an active duty military member, I felt very proud of what I and my fellow team members accomplished here at Eglin.

      Now, if the latest Air Force budget realignment plan is approved, that mission will no longer be being accomplished at Eglin.  All my years of sacrifice will mean nothing, and our community of Eglin workers who have always put “duty before all else” will be left with nowhere to turn for their future.  You see, we’ve built homes, lives, relationships, a community here at Eglin.  We are brothers and sisters dedicated to giving our all in order to produce the very best results for the military that we possibly can.

      On that note, I have personally heard many of our project officers remark that they will never go back out west to test again, if they have any choice in the matter.  They remark that they get 100% results here, and in a much shorter turnaround time than out west.  Also, they get much more accurate data here than out there.  I have heard this comment within the last 2 months.  

      The armament community here at Eglin is unique in that a weapon can be visualized, designed, prototyped, built, tested and deployed all right here in one location.  There is nowhere else in the armed forces that a weapon can be taken from the cradle to the battlefield in one place.

      Eglin is also unique because it has three areas from which an item can enter the test areas – the land ranges, the Gulf ranges, and the Atlantic Ocean.  Other bases can offer only two.

 The elimination of thousands of high wage jobs would result in a downward moral, fiscal and spiritual decline that this area has never known.  The new jobs that BRAC promises to bring to the area in the form of training missions will not begin to make up for the loss of high wage, high intellect jobs that will be shifted to the western bases, although there is no guaranty that the engineers and scientists working at Eglin will relocate there.

      Our community would suffer greatly from the “training base only” plan.  The knowledge base that would be lost to other areas as the Eglin scientists and engineers leave to find other jobs would not only be devastating to the future of the Armed Forces weapon development, but to the Eglin community as well.  Along with the knowledge exodus would come the entrance of the temporary duty mindset and morals exhibited in the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Tampa areas.  These areas have all been victims of the training base mentality and subsequent degradation of family oriented communities.  We do not want our community to become the next victim.

      Finally, putting all the weapons development and testing capabilities at one single range would greatly diminish the quantity of actual testing accomplished every year.  There simply is no way that one base can accommodate all the testing that is done at the present time using Eglin and the western ranges.  A great percentage of testing needs would be unmet, and therefore directly affect the weapons development of our armed forces.  Our country would quickly fall behind in weapons development, putting us at risk of no longer being the world’s greatest military might, and, therefore, vulnerable to attack.

      I urge you to do everything in your power to protect Eglin and our community from the possible cuts that the Air Force thinks will enhance its capabilities, but as you can see from the points I’ve made in this letter, will actually not only hurt the Eglin community, but our country’s well being as well.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

My name is Cliff Meyers and I am employed at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base in Ft. Walton Beach Florida.  

 

I don’t know if you are aware of the effort underway to move the 46th Test Wing from Eglin to Edwards AFB in California.  This proposal will put at least 3400 people out of work here in NW Florida and the economic impact will be felt greatly.  The types of jobs lost include highly trained technicians, engineers, scientists and upper management.  Not lower class paying jobs.  

 

The reason for the move from what we hear is that Eglin is going to become a training base and that up to 3000 personnel will be coming with this effort.  But what isn’t being told is that these folks will be temporary, doing their training and then leaving the area and that these folks are the lower wage military grade personnel and will not make the economic impact on the area that the ones who were laid off did.  Plus, these training personnel are not area voters.  The ones being laid off are.

 

I know the job of the military does not lie with the governor but you do have and ear in Washington.  

 

This effort is being driven hard by the Air Force Material Command.

 

Many rumors are flying around the work place and I am not one who throws rumors to the wind but there are a lot of questions going unanswered and all of the facts are not being addressed.

 

I don’t know how familiar you are with the McKinley Climatic Laboratory.  It is a one of a kind facility which produces climatic conditions to have the ability to perform climatic testing on aircraft and other items and equipment in the Department of Defense inventory as well as for commercial customers, domestic and foreign.  We are the largest test facility of this kind in the world and a national asset.

 

Many livelihoods will be lost if this effort is allowed to continue forward and the economic impact, or lack thereof, to the area will be greatly felt for years to come.

 

I know you have many items on your agenda that takes your time but I hope you will spend just a few moments looking in to this and gathering as much information as you can.

 

Thank you for your time and if I can provide you any information please let me know.

The local newspaper (Northwest Florida Daily News) reported Friday and again today that the 46 Test Wing may be downsized and moved to Edwards AFB.  Just a few years ago plans were being made by Col. Sager  who was the 46 Test Wing commander at Eglin at that time to close the Climatic Lab.  I contacted the newsroom editor at the Daily News and asked  if they were aware of this and was told no but that they would  look into it.  I talked with the news editor a few days later and found out that their questions surprised Col. Sager and his staff as though they preferred the public not be made aware of their plans.  Also, I understand he had closed other programs at other bases prior to coming to Eglin.   I contacted your office through a mutual friend and I believe you made a visit to Eglin a few days later.  It appeared at that time that the plans to close the climatic lab were being done in a very quiet manner just as it's being done again today.  Much of the news coming out today sounds exactly like what was being told by Col. Sager when he previously tried to close the lab.  Col. Sager left Eglin and went to Wright-Patterson.
   
My husband as well as many other men and women depend on their jobs.  Many of us grew up here and have raised or are raising our families here and depend on Eglin for our livelihood.  Reports are that 5% of contractor personnel will be eliminated as of October 1, 2006.  Most of that 5% were born and raised here in Okaloosa County.  
 
It's my understanding that a decision will be made by August 1st and again appears as though someone may have been intending the public not be aware until it was too late.  Many millions of dollars have been spent at the lab in recent months to help secure and test some of our major weapons systems and according to reports the last two years have made money for the air force.  It would be a shame to close a facility such as the lab and cost men and women their jobs in order to earn a star.  And, if a facility such as the climatic lab can be shut down and the 46 Test Wing moved, how soon will Eglin be picked apart?
 
I'm asking that you please check into this.  It just appears that one, perhaps several, have an agenda that doesn't include Eglin AFB.  I appreciate anything that you can do, as do others who will be affected if this plan goes through.
 
Thanks,
Noma Holloway

Governor Bush,
   Once again Eglin AFB is on the chopping block about to loose valuable Test 
capabilities to the West Coast (Edwards AFB). It is sad that Military politics 
can disrupt such an IMPORTANT function as the 46th Test Wing and the Climatic 
Lab. When this Countries Warfighters are in need, this is where they turn for 
fast results such as the MOAB (the 1st one was Packed inside the Main Test 
Chamber at the C/LAB) and, Bunker Busters in the 1st Gulf war. How could 
Edwards possibly match Eglin's Land and Water range capabilities and why would 
you want all of your Military Testing moved to one place?
   This is the second time the McKinley Climatic Lab. has found its self in 
the crosshairs in 3 years.A cost study in 2003 proved that it would be more 
costly to close the Lab than keep it open. The Lab has a work schedule that 
will support its operation. It is a SHAME that Someone up-line in OUR Military 
seems to have an Agenda to see this Valuable, Historic and One of a Kind 
Facility closed!  Simulated Flight Test Evaluation capabilities for the ACM / 
ACLM Cruise Missile are coming on line this month (at a cost of how much? to 
Tax Payers) only to Face a proposed Closure date of Oct 1, 2006. 
    As a Contract Employee at the McKinley Climatic Lab. I see its unmatched 
value on a Daily basis and find it completely ABSURD that anyone could imagine 
a cost savings in the closure of this National Asset! It has been proven time 
and again that Testing here is more cost effective than on the West Coast.  
These Actions have been taken quietly and it has been implied that Test Wing 
Personal were instructed (Threatened?) not to discuss (suppress?) this 
information to aparently Delay any resistance until it was too late to change 
the outcome. Please take URGENT Action to stop this process.

Governer Bush,
   As you are probably aware, there is a movement afoot to move the 46 Test Wing from Eglin Air Force Base to Edwards Air Force Base in California. I am an employee of Indyne Inc. working for the 46 Test Wing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. We feel all of the facts are not being considered. The cost of testing at Eglin is substantually less than testing at Edwards. We have been through 2 BRAC"s and a few GAO studies that have proven the cost savings. Also, we give a better data product and complete more missions than Edwards. As to my situation, The Climatic Lab has been in service since 1947, and is the only facility of it's kind in the entire world. 
   My co-workers and myself feel if the facts are know to all concerned, this would be be bad move for the local area and the country. All of the "smart bombs" currently being used by our armed forces were developed at Eglin Air Force Base. 
   In closing, It seems that time is an issue. The closures could start as soon and August first. Would you please have someone look into this matter. Thank you.

Governor Jeb Bush, 

 

All I can say is Unbelievable.  That was my reaction to the official announcement of the “possibility” of the 46 Test Wing (TW) moving to Edwards, California.  I would like to see an investigation into what’s really happening.   About 3-4 years ago the Air Force changed the way the 46 TW acquired its budget.  Basically it aligned the Wing with the rest of the Air Force, receiving its entire budget from the DOD.   As I understand it, a large portion of the Test Wings budget was from contractors paying the wing to test its munitions (small portion from DOD).  For the most part we were self sufficient.  So, my question is, why the change?  IF money is a factor for the move to Edwards then why change the wing’s budget?  You can’t claim shrinking budgets and realignment as the answer if the budget is coming from outside the DOD.  I believe there’s more here than meets the eye.  As you know, the water ranges currently utilized by Eglin is under siege.  In my opinion this move is a big part of that.  IF the move happens, the bombing range in the gulf will become essentially a training range which will lessen its importance.  No longer will we be able claim its “Vital to National Defense”.  This will leave the water ranges wide open for offshore drilling.  If drilling in the gulf would return gas to pre-Ivan prices then in my opinion it would be for the best, but I am afraid the price of gas will never drop below $2.50 again.   My interest in this is that I am a civil service employee on Eglin; Florida is my home and has been since 1990.  Please, I implore you; fight this with all the means at your disposal.

But I guess it is not what you have done that counts it is who you are that counts.  You sure did not have time to meet with me.

My son was not drunk/beligerent or anthing else when his life work was taken from him.  He was an innocent bystander and he got the shaft.  The best coach in high school baseball.  I sent you the clipping from the Sentinel to prove it .  All he did was not fail to fill out a piece of paper that he was unaware of and his world fell apart.  

If you have any guts whatsoever you will make me an appointment and at least let me tell you face to face.

But of course, the person who reads this email has to have some guts to.  Remember whoever you are if you did not work for the governor and a member of your family got into trouble you would be treated the same way I have been.  SHABBY!!

If John Tanners daughter gets off scott free there is more wrong with this world than I thought.

Subject:	[*] Hello, Governor Jeb Bush

I want to first say I hope that you and your family are doing well, I am typing this email in hopes that the governor get to read it but just in case he doesnt I want to acknowledge who ever reads his mail. My name is (Rosa Brown), recently I type the governor a letter and did not get satisfaction concerning my fiance( Terrance P. Bastian) who is yet incarcerated at Dade Correctional Institution. I want to first say that the new news that I have received is down right sickening to me because my fiance has never harmed me his child or anyone else, I agree that he has did crimes that has him where he is but all we ask for his that he be allowed to come home based on the fact that he has served most of his sentence. 
Lastnight, while I was watching the news I saw a man (Emanuel Cadillion) was arrested for questioning about 25 murders not only that he is a career criminal  that also has been in and out of jail since 1996 but for some violent and deadly crimes yet, he was out walking freely on the street around innocent civilians and I ask myself what make this man so special that he is allowed to get chances. Trust me I didn't want to use anyone to prove a point, I just want my fiance(Terrance) to come home. I love him and we want to get married recently I finished school in Medical Billing and Terrance has achieved his high school diploma and other certifications while in Glades Correctional so, tell me is this a man who deserve a chance when you go home at night think about how happy you are around the one you love. I tried to explain his daughter(Latadra)situation millions of times but know one seem to really care about our situation they only care about punishment instead of our happiness.
I am sending this email again to someone who care to help resolve this matter we already applied for clemency and was turned down with a reason, we already pleading to the judge and I have been typing letters and waiting for a longtime and still my prayers are not answered.
Please, hear me.
 
Sincerely,
Ms.Rosa Brown

Subject:	Return of Navy to Cecil Field

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing you to request your assistance with the issue of the return of the Navy to Cecil Field (CF).  You took the initiative in August 2005 by leading the Florida delegation to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission to advocate for the return of the Navy to Cecil Field as an economic boon for all of Northeast Florida.  Later, Mayor Peyton and the Jacksonville City Council “cut the legs” off your positive efforts by yielding to “small group” (the Better Westside Project (BWP), disgruntled citizens of the Westside of Jacksonville) politics, a pattern he and the majority of the membership of the City Council have followed since their election. Mayor Peyton wrote the BRAC Commission, AFTER they had decided to recommend the return of the Master Jet Base (MJB) to Cecil Field IF Virginia Beach, VA and their NAS Oceana base failed to meet preconditions for retention of the MJB, essentially “reneging” on the agreements made in SWORN TESTIMONY to the BRAC Commission, and foreswearing the possibility of the Navy return to Cecil Field in favor of a “misguided and largely ineffectual” effort to seek new tenants for Cecil Commerce Center (CCC).
The 2005 BRAC Final Report, with the CF option included, was submitted to the President, he forwarded it UNCHANGED to the U.S. Congress, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed it UNCHANGED, and the President signed it into LAW.  In June 2006, the Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General (IG) found Virginia Beach, VA, and the State of Virginia were NONCOMPLIANT with the preconditions for retaining the MJB at NAS Oceana, and the door was wide open for the Navy to return to CF.  To qualify for the return of the Navy to CF, the State of Florida and Jacksonville had to do two things: 1. They had to ASK FOR RETURN; and 2. They had to comply with three preconditions in the 2005 BRAC LAW as quoted below:

“if the State of Florida appropriates sufficient funds to relocate commercial tenants presently located at Cecil Field, Florida, appropriates sufficient funds to secure public-private ventures for all the personnel housing required by the Navy at Cecil Field to accomplish this relocation and turns over fee simple title* to the property comprising the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field, including all infrastructure improvements that presently exist, to the Department on or before December 31, 2006”

“*The State of Florida may not encumber the title by any restrictions other than a reversionary clause in favor of the State of Florida and short-term tenancies consistent with the relocation of the Master Jet Base to Cecil Field.” 

Mayor Peyton and the Jacksonville City Council (JCC) have persisted in their “misguided and ill-informed” pursuit of the CCC option, and continue to sign up new commercial tenants, and allocate former CF land to prospective new developments: a new Florida Community College of Jacksonville (FCCJ) Westside Campus; a Bridgestone-Firestone Regional Distribution Center; and future “unnamed, secret, significant tenants” who are still “in negotiations”.
A group called Concerned Citizens for Cecil Field (CCCF), advocates for a referendum to decide this issue, and advocating the return of the Navy to CF, was started in late June 2006 led by Bill Gay Jr. of W.W. Gay Mechanical Contractors, Inc.  Also in late June 2006, a group of Jacksonville African-American ministers have come out expressing their advocacy for the additional jobs (publicized as 12,000 jobs with an annual payroll of $800 million) which the Navy return to CF would provide.  If a referendum is conducted, and the majority of the voters of Duval County advocate return of the Navy to CF ( rather than continue the pursuit of the CCC and future commercial tenants), can the citizens of Jacksonville count on you to call a Special Session of the Florida Legislature to consider (and hopefully pass) legislation for those measures and funding by the State of Florida required to be compliant with the 2005 BRAC LAW by the deadline of 31 December 2006?  If the majority of the registered voters in Duval County advocate by referendum return of the Navy to CF, will you support that action, and will you exert the power of your office to prevail upon Mayor Peyton and the JCC to abide by that vote, and take the actions necessary to COMPLY WITH THE 2005 BRAC LAW to return the Navy to CF?
I respectfully request that, as a “lame duck” Governor with NOTHING TO LOSE, and a fellow Republican, that you do all in your power to get Mayor Peyton and the JCC to change their minds and support the return of the Navy to CF.  You have stated in the past that “this is a local decision”, but if a referendum shows that the majority of Duval County voters favor the return of the Navy to CF, I hope that you will pressure the 19 people (Mayor Peyton and 18 of 19 JCC members) who are currently BLOCKING return, to abide by the will of the majority of Duval County voters.
In October 2005, I can see where the Mayor and the JCC may have thought the “odds” were against the return of the Navy to CF, and therefore, the prior course of converting CF to CCC, and pursuing future commercial tenants there was a “low risk” choice.  At present, there is virtually NO RISK to pursuing the Navy return to CF, except a COURT CHALLENGE by the State of Virginia.  Such a challenge in the Courts would challenge the whole BRAC Process. It would also pit Virginia against all the “winners” (States who retained or gained bases) in BRAC 2005 who would oppose any such challenge.  The Federal Government has “Eminent Domain” to legitimize their RIGHT to return the Navy to CF IF the State of Florida is COMPLIANT with the 2005 BRAC LAW preconditions.  No challenge in the Courts by a “perceived WRONGED” Florida property owner would be prohibitive unless the Federal Government consented to the lawsuit.
If current tenants at CCC were offered “comparable land” at Jacksonville International Airport (JIA) on the Northside, and were compensated for “relocation expenses” in accordance with 2005 BRAC LAW, they would likely not object.  Jacksonville has been trying to attract businesses to the Northside for years, and this move could be a “boon” to the JIA area as well as provide job opportunities to many nearby African-American citizens.  The return of the Navy to CF could provide an economic stimulus to Northeast Florida as a whole of $8.8 BILLION over 11 years in direct payroll alone, with whatever “economic multiplier” you want to use to project the total impact on the area’s economy.
I implore you to take whatever ACTIVE ROLE which you can to facilitate the return of the Navy to CF, which you CORRECTLY perceived in August 2005 as being in the long term interest of all of Northeast Florida.  There are no “long term” LOSERS in having the Navy return to CF.  All disgruntled Westside landowners will either adapt to the new MJB environment (as the citizens of Virginia Beach, VA adapted to the noise of NAS Oceana), or they will be adequately compensated at Fair Market Rates if they sell and move elsewhere, since the average Jacksonville area home is APPRECIATING 10-15% per year!  12,000 new job holders at CF will make a rich “SELLERS MARKET” for existing Westside home owners.  I thank you for your support and attention to this matter.  It will make a good “legacy” for your final 6 months in office.  Sincerely, John Turnipseed, Republican, Arlington resident, Major USAF (retired).

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for all you have done for education in Florida.  I began as a 
teacher when you started in office and have followed your educational plan in 
my classroom from the start.  I also worked directly with Rep. Traviesa and 
Rep Arza and received regular e-mails from your teacher in residence.  It has 
worked and my students have achieved higher than most.  Every time I heard 
someone who was negative about the changes being made I just said look, it 
works in my classroom.  Many listened and also put into action your 
initiatives for the same results.  You pushed me to work harder for the 
achievement of my students and it worked.  

Both my husband and I changed professions when we had children.  Both of us 
have advanced degrees and believe in the importance of education, him with a 
J.D., and myself with a M.S.  We wanted to do something that would allow us to 
spend time with our children and make a contribution to their futures, so we 
became teachers, he in science and myself in technology.  Both of us have been 
successful in creating an environment for learning and have earned several 
awards in the process, but mostly our students have achieved and will be 
successful because of the things you have pushed in Florida.  I highly 
encourage people to take on the profession of a teacher in their area of 
expertise even if only for a few years.

I met you 2 years ago in Orlando at IT Florida conference where I brought a 
student who was a product of the successful practices you initiated (Ben).  I 
had developed a magnet school where students were graduating in 3 years from 
high school.  (you may not remember it but we gave you a credit card CD that 
Ben produced about the school)  Ben has gone on to college and I am sure will 
be very successful.  I also have won the Governor's Award for Economic 
Excellence in Teaching several times.  

I just wanted you to know that you have made a significant impact on my 
husband and I and on the students we teach every day.  The education reforms 
you have pushed are outstanding.  It all came home yesterday when my 6 year 
old daughter told me that she wanted to be a teacher like me when she grew up.  
We have supported you and wish you well in your future endeavors.

Dear Governor Bush;

 

As you surely know by now, the situation at the 46th TW at Eglin AFB is critical, and we may be looking at a move that would severely hurt many citizens of northwest Florida and cause a major economic crisis throughout our area of the panhandle.  The brass in Washington who are pushing this move are calling it a “wash,” due to BRAC sending troops in soon that they claim will offset the loss of our test mission.  However, this in a total “whitewash.”  You don’t eliminate thousands of high paying scientific, engineering and technical positions with 200 wage-grade jobs and maintain the economic status-quo.

 

With the war on terror, tensions in Iran, North Korea and China, now is NOT the time to risk the quality of weapons testing and development.  I can’t tell you how many Air Force project officers have left Eglin over the years amazed at the support we give them.  They are used to 70-80% data, delivered in a week to ten days out west, and can’t believe we provide the highest quality data at 100%, usually on the same day, and often instantaneously.  The fact that the last BRAC study recommended MORE testing be moved to Eglin because of our excellence makes this move by others now wanting to shut testing down entirely reek of politics rather than national interest.

 

We trust you will join this battle and work long and hard to save the Eglin community.  Please contact all the right people in Washington, and use the power of your office to let everyone from the President to the Secretary of Defense know this is move that could have a severely impact our nation’s readiness at a time when world tensions demand we remain as strong a we can possibly be.

RE:     James J. DeKleva 

Dear Governor Bush, 

Thank you for this opportunity to write to you on behalf of Mr. James J. DeKleva and to strongly recommend him for the Circuit Judge position in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in Seminole County, Florida.  I am an attorney in the Central Florida area and have had the opportunity to work with Mr. DeKleva on a professional level as well as to have known him for over 25 years on a personal level.  Jim is always prepared and very professional.  I have known Mr. DeKleva's entire family for most of my life as my mother worked as a dental hygienist for his dentist father.  Jim comes from a wonderful, well-grounded family and is a very honest and fair man.  It is my intention to let you know what an asset Mr. Jim DeKleva would be to the judicial community.  

Thank you for the attention you shall give this matter.  If there is anything else I can do to shed some additional light on Mr. James DeKleva, I would be more than happy to do so.  Please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 

STATUE OF HENRY FLAGLER TO BE DEDICATED IN CELEBRATION OF THE 110th ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF MIAMI

 

(Miami, FL)- To commemorate the 110th Anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Miami, a statue of Henry Morrison Flagler will be dedicated on the steps of the Miami Dade County Courthouse.

 

Miami Dade County Courthouse

73 West Flagler Street (south entrance)

Miami, FL 33130

Friday, July 28, 2006, 11:00 a.m.

 

The dedication ceremony will be attended by Miami Dade Commissioner Bruno A. Barreiro, District 5;  Miami Dade Art in Public Places Executive Director, Ivan A. Rodriguez; Chief Judge of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida, Joseph P. Farina; descendants of Henry Flagler; representatives from the Flagler Museum, project promoter and facilitator Frank Lopez Del Rincon, and other members of the local business and governmental communities.

 

The statue is being donated to Miami Dade County by Col. G.F. Robert Hanke, great grandson of Henry Flagler and Vice President of the Flagler Museum in Palm Beach.       Originally commissioned in 1902 by Henry Flagler’s wife, the statue was created by an unknown sculptor in Rome, whose initials are C.J.R. The statue, which depicts Henry Flagler dressed in a long coat, is cast in bronze, standing 88 inches high and weighing 930 lbs. 

 

Henry Flagler’s contributions to the State of Florida were numerous, including his promotion of Florida’s agricultural industry, establishing Florida’s tourism industry through the luxury hotels he built from St. Augustine to Miami, and perhaps most notably, the Florida East Coast Railway, a transportation system that linked the entire east coast of Florida from Jacksonville to Key West.   

 

Henry Flagler’s life truly epitomized the strength, vitality and promise of America’s Gilded Age. The statue of Henry Flagler on the Miami Dade County Courthouse steps will serve as a lasting monument to the extraordinary vision and determination that gave birth to modern Florida.

 Commissioner May Have Violated City Harassment Policy
POSTED: 5:31 pm EDT July 6, 2006 
UPDATED: 5:36 pm EDT July 6, 2006 
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Channel 9 has learned an Orlando city commissioner may have
violated a harassment policy that she voted for. City Commissioner Daisy
Lynum voted for the harassment policy within the last three years. 
The controversy centers on Lynum, who referred to a police officer as a
"white boy." The officer had pulled over Lynum's son for a traffic
violation. 
Channel 9 looked at the city's discrimination policy to see if that
statement violated the city ordinance and if she could be disciplined. 
Lynum lead the vote for the city's harassment policy for employees, which
prohibits comments that denigrate or show aversion toward someone because of
color or race which create an intimidating, hostile or offensive work
environment.

Subject:	Your Loss of Trust

I believe that this is one of your quotes:

"I am disappointed by this violation of the public's trust and by the abuses committed by those in leadership positions. Our work requires the highest level of integrity. Anything less is unacceptable and undermines the good work done by many capable and committed state employees.'' 

I am assuming that you did not mean for that to apply to Ken Jenne. 

It's sad to sit and watch as Jenne beats out even John Gotti in slipperiness. 

What's sadder still, is that you have continuously tried to pacify me throughout the years by having people from FDLE or subordinate members of your staff return answers to my correspondence. One might have thought that it might be more applicable to show a tad more respect to:

A Republican in a heavy Democratic area.
A former member of the United States Intelligence Community.
A citizen, who realized Jenne was perpetrating a fraud even before you came into office.
A citizen who has given his all to helping the citizens of Broward County.

After all of my writing to you, after all of my supporters writing to you, after you disrespected me in my run for Sheriff in 2004 and after all of the press that I have been given on the subject, you would think that just once, you would have gotten off your high horse and contacted me personally. 

The irony to a lot of this is that there are a growing number of Jenne supporters that are even wondering what the hell is on your mind in this whole thing. You have dismissed countless other officials for far less evidence.

I guess we will simply have to see how history sees this out. Probably, not well.

Gov. Bush, 

I was hoping you'd take 5 minutes or less sometime in the next 2 weeks with a fun project we're doing. 

The theme: "the best of college football." The category: the best rivalries. Obviously, Texas-Oklahoma is one of them. 

You don't have to be a football expert to answer this. Just being a former Texas student is enough. 

I'm just asking a few folks from all walks of life for the one thing they dislike most about the other school; in this case, Oklahoma. Definitely doesn't have to be football-related; probably best if something off the field. Obviously, feel free to have fun with it. Could be a joke, a quick pot shot about Oklahoma, anything you'd like it to be. 

A few examples are below (you don't have to follow their format) of John Kerry on Harvard and Michael Dukakis on Yale. 
I'm just looking for a sentence or 2. 

If you could e-mail me back, I'd be eternally grateful. 

Thanks for your time.

Dear Mr. Bush, I wish to make a personal appeal to you prior to leaving office. My wife and I met you and the cabinet last Dec. Unfortunatly it was at a clemency hearing. You impressed me as an educated, honest and caring individual who actually was familiar with each case. My particular issue involved a $50,000 fine. I did not persue this any further becuase there is no way on God's earth I can pay this. You pointed this out to Mr. Crist at the time, very realistic. You invited me to try before you left office, so here it is. I did indeed pay some court costs while in work release. I also saved the State a considerable sum by participating in a new & unique program that involved taking inmates, training them, and replacing the cleaning contractors at D.O.C. headquarters. This resulted in a savings to taxpayers of about $250,000. I am disabled, recieve no benefits from gov't. or private sources. I do try to make a living with artwork we produce. I declare this income on my taxes and thru VSA and Florida Dep't of Education, contribute 50% of sales to other disabled persons. I am not a saint, but made serious errors and regret this. You have had these issues in your own life with your children. This is sad, hard on a family, mine or yours. If substance abuse is a disease, I did not meet anyone convicted of having cancer from cigarettes in prison!!! The DOC, in fact treated me well and will provide my best references to you. Ask the staff who dealt with me personally, incl. then Secretary Moore and Mr. Wolfe. Fireworks are illegal, but multi- million dollar stores selling them abound in So. Florida, Sir. The people who buy them are arrested.
    We have a teenage daughter in the Sherrifs Youth Ranch at our own expense to try and get her on the right track, and are grateful for this program. As a father with child problems, I'm sure you must understand. I am not a whiner, don't think I deserve any thing special, but would like to vote and try to change things that need changed. I am not trying to "suck up" either. You did strike me as man with integrity, lacking in many political figures today. As a life long Democrat, for what it is worth, you would have my vote in the future. I mean that as a compliment to you personally, as the man you are. I did use the training provide by DOC to get a job promptly upon release, also further used it to get certification in home inspection, also at my own expense. I did mention this to you in Dec. that I tried to assist during our hurricane crisis by using this education, but was denied as a convicted felon!!! A person should not pay forever because of substance abuse. Child molesters, car jackers, rapists, quite possibly so. We are from the same generation, not an excuse or justification, but a fact. We have been forced to take a 2nd mortage for homeownwers ins. this week, although have never made a claim. These problems must be acted upon and voting is the essential first step. Your consideration in this is most appriceated, and regardless of outcome, our best wishes for you and your familie's future endeavors is humbly and sincerely extended. I'm trying very hard to change many things and your consideration is valuable, sir. My goal is to display my art in the Capitol Gallery and contribute to society as much as possible the rest of my life. My entire family now lives in Fla. and this all matters to me in a deep way.

Re. Appointment of Louise B. Zeuli, Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida.
 
Prior to retiring to Florida in 1981 I was employed for thirty years working for the Federal Government as a registered nurse at the Louise Nourse Rogers Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts. I worked up from a staff nurse to several supervisory positions and was certified by the American Nurses Association as a Geriatric Nurse Specialist. In addition to providing direct patient care I was actively involved in support to families and other care givers after patients were discharged from inpatient care status. 
 
My present activities include participating in the Retired Senior Volunteer Program in Seminole County.
 
When I needed legal advice two years ago to update my will I turned to the Internet for Attorney Resumes before making a decision. I was really impressed with the background information which Attorney Louise B. Zeuli presented. Not only did she have excellent legal credentials but I recognized that her nursing background was a real asset in her dealings with clients.
 
My personal contacts with Attorney Zeuli confirmed my initial impression that she is a warm person who is genuinely interested in providing the best advice to her clients and she never fails to explain matters so that they are fully understood.
 
I strongly support the appointment of Louise B. Zeuli to fill the vacancy for circuit court judge in Seminole County. She is honest, even tempered, knowledgeable in many areas of the law and has been a general civil litigator for twenty three years. Additional life experiences which could be very helpful include her background as a Critical Care Registered Nurse, Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner, Mediator and Arbitrator.

Subject:	Expedition of Investigation supporting Application for Restoration of Civil Rights

The Honorable Jeb Bush

Governor of the State of Florida

 

Governor Bush:

 

This is the third email I have sent you regarding my application for restoration of my civil rights in Florida.  I am sorry to be such a bother. 

 

My application was filed in November 2004.  On June 16, 2006, I received a letter from Janet Keels, Coordinator of the Office of Executive Clemency, informing me that I had been accepted for restoration of civil rights without a hearing and that the file was being forwarded to Mr. Hebert for investigation.

 

My request is that you ask Mr. Hebert to expedite the investigation.  I need the Certificate so that I can take the Bar Exam on July 25 & 26 of this year.  A computer check will verify that I do not have so much as a speeding ticket since my felony in 1998. My civil rights were restored in Missouri before I moved to Florida, but the FL Bd of Bar Examiners takes the position that since Missouri prohibits ex-felons from serving on juries that I must have a FL Restoration Certificate before I can take the Bar, thereby achieving full Florida citizenship.  

 

Please understand that I hold two of the three badges of Florida citizenship.  That is, I am a registered voter and I can run for most offices, including Governor.  [I am not planning on running, however, anytime soon.  This is an attempt to instill a little levity.]

 

Reasons to consider in giving me special consideration are:

 

1.	I am already a voting Florida citizen.
2.	My application is 20 months old, so I am near the top of the pile anyway.
3.	If I cannot take the bar in July, this puts me back nearly one year in getting back to a profession I hold more dear than I ever thought possible. [Nearing 60, I agree with the President about age.  However, the years grow more precious the older you get and I have a lot to make up for.]
4.	I worked with federal authorities to atone for my behavior even after I had served my sentence.  [I don’t consider this a big deal.  I wish that I had gone to the Feds much, much earlier.  I have learned the hard way that the Marine motto – Death before Dishonor – is the only way the live – or die.]
5.	I am a good father and husband, and in committing my offense, the only persons hurt were myself and, eventually, a bunch of bad guys.  No, I do not consider myself a bad guy even though I sinned and sinned mightily.
6.	In my career and personal life I have contributed to the greater good.

 

Finally, I have asked the assistant US attorney who prosecuted me – James Crowe of the US Attys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri to forward a recommendation to you.  Mr. Crowe returns to his office on Monday, July 10, 2006.  So, if he decides to recommend that you cause my investigation to be expedited, his recommendation will come no sooner than July 10, 2006.

 

Please also know that I chatted twice with Vickie Brennan of your staff about my request and I have promised her I will not bother her again.  Please also know that I appreciate the courtesies of Ms. Brennan, Ms. Keels’ Office and the time you take to review this.  If you decide my request is without merit, I understand.

 

If I am eventually successful in gaining admission to the Florida Bar, I certainly intend to tell my story to as many in the Bar as will listen.  My negative experience, I believe, can become a positive lesson for many.  In addition, should you ever be interested, I believe my experience has given me a unique and valuable insight into several challenges facing America.  I was on the top, then on the bottom, and I have been on the road back since my fall from grace.  As the old saying goes, “What don’t kill you, makes you stronger.”  It can also make you better, if one is willing to accept the truth.

 

Thanks.

Re:	Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee

Dear Governor Bush:

Enclosed on behalf of Frank Nutter, President of the Reinsurance Association of America, is a "Questionnaire for Gubernatorial Appointments" regarding a possible appointment to the Governor's Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee.

As you can see by the enclosed questionnaire, Frank Nutter has long years of experience in the property and casualty industry and has been President of the Alliance of American Insurers (which recently merged with the NAII to become the Property Casualty Insurance Association of America), at that time one of the three national property and casualty trade associations.  He also has chaired the National Disaster Coalition and is on the Board of the International Hurricane Center in Miami. 

The RAA is a national trade association representing property and casualty organizations that specialize in reinsurance.  The RAA membership is diverse, including broker and direct, U. S. companies and subsidiaries of foreign companies.
 
The fact that Frank Nutter has stated his interest in serving on the Committee as a representative of reinsurers indicates his awareness of the challenges facing Florida and other hurricane prone states, and his desire to make a positive contribution in solving the current homeowners' insurance crisis.  Obviously, reinsurance is a key factor in the resolution of these problems and the RAA member companies want to share their experience and advice to that end.

Mr. Nutter is currently out of the country.  He has approved the enclosed application and has authorized his signature to be appended.  Upon his return to the United States next week, a notarized questionnaire will be promptly forwarded to your office. 

Thank you for considering Frank Nutter as an appointee to the Committee.

Sincerely,


Dennis C. Burke

Sir,
 
Attached are letters of recommendation regarding my notary application. Please, please reconsider your decision to deny a notary appointment. I understand the morals and values you feel important for a notary appointment. I was young, stupid and involved with the wrong people when I was charged with these crimes. If you need anything else to help in the decision process, please let me know. I apologize for being such a pest. I am in the construction industry and it would be so convenient since we have to notarize so many things.  Thank you very much!!

Heather, I spoke with Jean Hartman last week and she suggested I amend my notary application by including some letters of recommendation. I am attaching five letters, one from my current boss (Jason Seubert), one from a previous employer (Marilyn Driver), one from my father (William R Buffkin) and two from life long friends (Brad Staats and Scott Shore).
 
Do you think I need more reference letters? Is that anything else you can suggest? Would you like Jeff Davis, FPC to provide a comment since he has done all the field work for my pardon. Thanks for your help!!

Jean,
 
My notary application has been denied by Jeb Bush, according to Heather Slager. I cannot get a reason from Heather or from the agency in Orlando that processed my application. I have been granted clemency, re-instating my civil rights by Jeb Bush and a full pardon is underway. The investigation is complete, nothing in my file to prevent a FULL pardon, according to Jeff Davis, Florida Parole Commission. All of this documentation was included in the FedEx package with my application on March 31.
 
I have left many voice mails and sent many emails requesting to speak to a person. Will you please call me at 321-436-7718? If not, please refer me to the appropriate person that I may speak with.
 
Thanks.

Thank you for contacting the Governor’s Notary Section!  Since the appointment of a notary is a discretionary act, there are no set criteria to guarantee a notary appointment.  (Please refer to section 117.01, Florida Statutes)  Additionally, the Governor does not give reasons for appointing or denying anyone an appointment.  You can either reapply for a commission or write the Governor's General Counsel requesting reconsideration at the address below.  Again, there is nothing that can be done to guarantee a notary commission appointment.
 
If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

When I call Florida Notary, they refer me to the State. When I call the State, they refer me to Florida Notary. Today I spoke to Doris and MaryAnn, both with the State, who referred me to you.

Greetings, 

Could you please direct me to the proper information source? 

My county, Volusia, is a charter county. 

We are presently undergoing the charter review process as required by law. 

I am concerned about the results of our Charter Review Commission's planned ballot question to amend our charter. 

I have contacted my County Council and County Attorney with my concerns. 

 I have been advised that County Council has no authority over the Charter Review Commission. 

I do not see how this is clear in either Florida Statute or our  Volusia Charter. 

My letter of concerns  to the county is attached and also appears below. 

I appreciate your guidance.

DATE:   June 8, 2006 
TO:             Volusia County Council 
RE:             Volusia Charter Review Commission Authority 

Greetings County Council, 
As a Volusia voter, I have questions and concerns with regard to the authority of Volusia’s Charter Review Commission.  

Florida Statute 125.64 Adoption of charter; dissolution of commission.-- 
 (2)   The charter shall provide a method for submitting future charter revisions and amendments to the electors of the county. 

Section 1303. Charter Review. The commission shall be funded by the council and shall be known as the "county charter review commission." It shall, within one (1) year from the date of its first meeting, present to the council any recommendations for amendment of the charter. After receipt of the charter review commission's recommendations, the council shall conduct a series of not less than three (3) public hearings on the recommended changes to the charter and shall thereafter schedule a referendum on the proposed charter amendment at the next general election.

Recommend is defined by Webster Dictionary as 

                To present as deserving of acceptance 

                Advise 

                Counsel 

I believe the above charter language clearly dictates that the CRC plays a limited role in the amendment of our charter in that the charter commission members are to review the charter and present their recommendations to county council and the public for review. Thereafter, the County Council will schedule a referendum on the proposed charter amendment but no where does our charter state the proposed charter amendment will be the exact worded recommendation of the CRC or that it has to be CRC’s recommendation at all. 


To date, the CRC has drafted a ballot that I feel opposes the goal and policies of our comprehensive plan which is to keep the Natural Resource Management intact.

The CRC suggests renaming our NRMA the Natural Resource Planning Area, ultimately divided with urban planning agreements between County Council and 16 municipalities.

As a citizen of Volusia, I bring these observations to Council for two reasons: 

	1)      I was advised by a member of Council that Council must accept and place on the ballot whatever the CRC comes up with (why then the 3 public hearings?) 

	2)      The CRC NRMA recommendation has been written by an attorney who sits on the CRC and represents several large landowners who own property within the NRMA and would greatly benefit from a strategically worded ballot question. 

	I do not see anywhere in the charter where the CRC is to actually write  a ballot question but only that it make  recommendations to County Council.  Shouldn’t the county attorney actually write the ballot? 

	I hope you can clear this up for me.

You need to intercede and remove this woman from her position.  A position

Then her racist remarks about Orlando's finest was an addition breach of

She should be removed from office immediately and replaced with someone who
isn't so racist in her attitude.

Dear Gov Bush    
 
I have been involved in the insurance business over forty years and have been invilved with Home Owner Associations and Condominium Associations for over 50 years. Currently I am President of a 92 unit Condominium Association in South west Florida. We have just received a 180% increase in our insurance premium that went from $108, 000 per year to $299,000 effective as of 6/6/06. We are concerned about the future of the Property & Casualty business in Florida.
 
I realize that this Increase is a result of the hurricanes that have devestated Florida over the past two years. However. we feel that their are solutions to the problem. 
 
The committee that your executive order created looks as if it has to move swiftly to meet the deadlines in the order.
 
 I and our board  would like to help through testimony as a condominium group. Our board is basically made up of individual homeowners that are classified as a commercial enterprise and as such are caught up in insurance property  rate increases that apply only because our association is filed as a corporation.
 
Because our organization is made up of Individual Executives  who were captains of industry in various fields of Insutance, Investments and Banking that we may be able to contribute significant information to the committee. 
 
We are willing to testify or work as part of the committee that will help formulate recommendations to Items 3a through 3f of the Executive Order Number 06-150.
 
Therefore I and the board of Indigo Shores at West Bay Club Condominium Association, Inc of Estero, Florida 33928  are willing to provide comment as mentioned in item 4 of the Executive Order Number 06-150

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
Please call for a special election to replace City of Yankeetown council persons who have resigned. 
 
Because of an additional resignation(s), no quorum exists and no quorum can be called in order to call to order a meeting to replace council members as contemplated under the City Charter. 
 
A special election is needed to replace these council members and should be held as soon as possible. A special election may be set through the Dept of State through Florida Statutes, Sections 100.111(5) and 100.342. 
Florida Statutes Sections 
100.111 (5)  In the event of unforeseeable circumstances not contemplated in these general election laws concerning the calling and holding of special primary elections and special elections resulting from court order or other unpredictable circumstances, the Department of State shall have the authority to provide for the conduct of orderly elections. 
 
100.342  100.342    Notice of special election or referendum.--In any special election or referendum not otherwise provided for there shall be at least 30 days' notice of the election or referendum by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, district, or municipality, as the case may be. The publication shall be made at least twice, once in the fifth week and once in the third week prior to the week in which the election or referendum is to be held. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, district, or municipality, the notice shall be posted in no less than five places within the territorial limits of the county, district, or municipality.”
 
The Supervisor of Elections stated that a Special Election could be organized and held in Yankeetown in as little as 6 weeks. 
 
Thank you for your continued attention to this matter,

Tallahassee, Florida

 

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

A judge should have broad legal experience, knowledgeable in many areas of the law and been a general civil litigator.  As someone who has had the good fortune to know Ms. Zeuli on both a personal and professional level I have experienced her dedication, honesty, patience and the respect she has achieved within the community.  I am very confident she is qualified for this appointment.

 

I am a resident in Seminole County and very active in the community. I initially met Ms. Zeuli at the Seminole Regional Chamber of Commerce.  I was the founder of the largest Business Network International group in Central Florida and she was a key member.  I am also on the Board of Directors for the National Association of Professional Mortgage Women and she graciously took time out of her busy schedule to be our keynote speaker of the month on Estate Planning.  As a member of the Board of Directors for Dignity U Wear, a charity organization found by Mr. Henry Lindwirth, she was a supporter of our fund raiser last November.  As you can see her service to the local community is very consistent.

 

As a friend, I have a tremendous amount of respect for her high degree of ethics and personal integrity.  She is very fair minded and such a good listener.  I can always rest assured that when I make a personal or professional appointment with her she will definitely be prompt and on time.

 

I have also relied on Louise’s expertise as an attorney.  I can assure you, that with her as your choice, you will have chosen a judge who not only meets all of the 

requirements, but who is committed to preserving the values upon which our great nation is founded.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
After reading Mr. Warnstadt’s letter to Deputy General Council Nathan Adams, I can no longer continue to be apart of the governing body of Yankeetown after eight years of service. I would like to address some of the points that Mr.Warnstadt has made in his letter that caused me to resign. He states that I, the vice-mayor, have not attended meetings since April. I have attended meetings in April, May, and June. I have missed four of the nine posted meetings. I apologize for missing those meetings, but my husband has cancer and was in the hospital for 3 weeks in April and also caused me to miss other meetings in May and June because of his continued health problems.  I was informed before all meetings that I missed that the mayor had a quorum. She continued to include a council member who had resigned immediately on May 11th in order to make the quorum, however he chose not to make the Mayor’s quorum for two of the four meetings I missed. 
 
The mayor states in the letter that”the Town is now without the ability to make required payments to the State, to suppliers, and to execute payroll checks”. However, the mayor knew that there were still two signatures that could sign on the checks, the mayor and I. In fact, I prepared the June 15th payroll while the mayor was on vacation for two and a half weeks. All the mayor had to do was co-sign the checks for the employees. As it turned out the mayor did not return to town when she said she would and the employees’ checks were late.
 
 I believe that the town could have continued operating and moving forward with the paying of town bills and day to day operation. The mayor chose to shut down Town Hall based on Mr. Warnstadt’s letter and Nathan Adams response to that letter. The mayor could have called for an emergency meeting to hire a town clerk resulting in having Town Hall open for business. Nor did she call for an emergency meeting to fill a council seat. Also, she did not post a workshop on improvements to the town water system planned for June 30th. Instead of having a public workshop, the council members had to meet individually with the engineer in order comply with Sunshine Rules. If we had this workshop the council could have shown that we could function and have meetings. 
 
I know that it is in your hands to bring this town back together again. I hope you will consider on an emergency election for the three vacated council seats instead of allowing Mayor Johannesson to appoint the vacancies. If she appoints, she will have appointed four of the five council seats. If that happens we will no longer have a democratically elected government in Yankeetown. The people of Yankeetown have been torn apart by all the dirty politics of the last six months. A democratic election will help to heal the town by giving the people a choice in who represents them in government. Please do the right thing for the people in Yankeetown and set an election.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Mary Pate

Subject:	[*] Louise Zeuli for Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County

Importance:	High

Honorable John Ellis "Jeb" Bush, 

It has been my privilege to know Louise Zeuli for the past ten years.  During that time, she has represented me in several legal matters and has become a personal friend of my wife and I.

I am a Client Partner in a Professional Services and Software Company, which is the largest Applications Software Company in the world.  In my role, I advise CIOs, CFOs and CEOs for some of the world's largest corporations.  My primary focus for these companies is to create business processes that can be used on a global basis.

Some of the companies I have assisted are The Coca Cola Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Dupont, Walt Disney, Siemens Corporation and Colgate Palmolive.  

I realize what it takes to be effective in the business world and the importance of interpersonal skills.  These companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the endeavors to revamp their business process.  

Louise had the business world understanding and the interpersonal skills to make her an effective litigator and mediator to bring a consensus solution to the problems she has to resolve.

Louise has extensive legal experience which she applies to resolving business issues.  She understands that the rule of law must apply, but she strives to bring adversaries together to bring about solutions, while not fearing the courtroom, if necessary.

Here are a few of the descriptions that I would use to describe Louise: 

1. Impeccably Honest 
2. Posses a rare ability to listen before forming any opinion.  She is intent on doing the "right thing", not just pushing forward without all the facts.

3. Extensive legal experience, seemingly conversant on all aspects of the law. 
4. Well respected, both professionally and personally. 
5. Diverse life experiences, which she can draw upon for her efforts on the bench. 
6. Her demeanor is always professional. 
7. She has always been prompt and punctual for any meetings, personal and profession. 
8. My wife and I find her a delight personally and enjoy our time together. 

Louise leads a very busy professional and personal life.  But she always seems to find a way to go the "extra mile".  My schedule is hectic and I fly out of town each week.  Louise has changed her schedule and visited us at home to meet on the various issues she has resolved for us.  

I will follow this short email with a letter outlining more of my reasons for recommending Louise for this opening on the 18th Judicial Circuit.  I wanted to get this email to you so you are aware of my whole hearted support for Louise.

My wife and I are registered Republicans and want our voices to be heard in support of Louise.  It's important to know that our Republican officials in Florida are listening to the voters who placed them in office.

Subject:	Florida's Selective Justice System

Since the federal government seems intent on letting your former employee, James Crosby, off the hook with no arrest or indictment -- so that he can get on with his life, as his attorney smugly stated -- I would hope that Florida's Attorney General would bring state charges against him that WILL result in an arrest, conviction and jail time, especially since he committed these crimes on your watch.  Otherwise, this is a travesty that makes a complete mockery of Florida's justice system.  Apparently the powers that be in Florida, including many politicians and judges, practice selective redemption.  That Mr. Crosby and others can commit such serious crimes "while in office" and get nothing more than a slap on the hand is an utter outrage!  Anyone else would have the book thrown at them and be thrown in prison.  If he does not face consequences like the rest of us, this will be a huge, ugly black mark on your history as Florida's governor.  After all, my family and I, after 8 1/2 long years of putting up with stupidity from Florida's legal system, would like to get on with our lives, as well, including the former victim who resides in our home but the powers that be seem hell-bent on not letting that happen.

Subject:	BCAIB Gubernatorial Appointment

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Good morning!  Last fall I submitted an application to your Appointment Office for a consumer position on the Building Code Administrators and Inspectors Board.  I would like to request that you please reconsider my application should a position become open.  I had spoken numerous times with Jennifer Bartolucci in the Appointment Office and by copy of this to her I am requesting that my application remain open.
 
I do, however, have some questions and concerns.  For a consumer member how do you check a person's qualifications if not through personal references?  These are the references I listed on my application:
 
1.  Hon. Jennifer Carroll (R), State Representative (904-573-4994).
2.  Hon. Glorious Johnson (R), City Council At-Large, Jacksonville (904-475-9335 home).
3.  Hon. Art Shad (R), City Council District 5, Jacksonville (904-613-7289 cell).
4.  Dr. Sally Hague, General Director of School Choice and Pupil Placement, Duval County Schools (904-390-2082).
5.  Ms. Lenelle Cruse, President-Elect Florida PTA (904-363-1936).
6.  Ms. Terri Florio, Executive Director Mal Washington Kids Foundation (904-301-3786).
 
Mr. Bush, not a single one of my references were contacted.  And, yes, I have spoken with each of them.  They all know me personally and I have worked with each one on various issues, boards and projects over the past decade.  I met with Representive Carroll last Thursday and she encouraged me to contact you and let you know that I am still interested and willing to serve on this Board.  I would be happy to provide more references or letters of recommendation if you so request.
 
I have a deep love of this State and commitment for the betterment of Florida for all citizens.  I am a 3rd generation Floridian.  My father is 87 years old and still living in the home he was born in.  My family taught values that I have tried to pass on to my children.  I have been very fortunate to have opportunities open to my children and that is why I've been extremely involved in community and education issues so that everyone in Florida will have the best possible future.  My son was a 1998 graduate of Stanton College Preparatory High School, earned 2 Bachelor degrees from UNF in 2001, graduated from Florida Coastal School of Law and passed the Bar in 2004 at the age of 23.  He was the youngest graduate in the history of Florida Coastal and the Florida Times-Union did a feature article on him for his accomplishments. My daughter will be a junior at Stanton this fall.  All children and all citizens deserve the best we can offer and I want to be a part of making that happen.  I have attended several BCAIB Board meetings in the past and plan to attend future meetings at my own personal expense.  I am very interested in serving on this Board and respectfully request that you consider me for any future opening.
 
Thank you for your time and the wonderful job you do for our great State!

It happened in 1994 in Lake County Florida, I was convicted of Conspiracy to commit robbery with no violence.  At the time I was heavily into drugs.  I am now a Christian and a minister.  I am hoping that you will show me a little mercy and allow me to have that one mistake removed from my record so that I can find a decent job and also move on with my life.  I have been praying that this and the other e-mail get to you.  I know that you are a very busy man and that I am really a nobody to you, but please at least consider a plea from someone who has paid for his crime and moved on to become a better person.

Subject:	12th Circuit JNC

The Honorable Governor Bush,

 

A number of years ago, perhaps 8 or 10, I served a brief period of time on the 12th Circuit Judicial Nominating Commission as a lay member.  I only went through one actual appointment when I received my notice that lay members were no longer going to be on the Commission, only Bar appointees and Governor appointees.  I would very much like to serve again, this time as your appointee.

 

The reasons the JNC selected me were many:  I am a Registered Nurse, as such, I am extremely analytical, persevering, and calm. My skills were quite handy when I ended up having to investigate a probate proceeding handled by one of the attorney-candidates.  Due to my research and interviews, I was able to uncover some blatant ethical violations that precluded this applicant from sitting on the bench.

 

I am deeply committed to a strong, unbiased and fair judicial system. I think you will find me to be just as valuable to the 12th Circuit JNC today, as I was the first time I served.  During the next round of appointments in November, I would appreciate your thoughtful consideration of me as a Governor appointee to the 12th Circuit JNC.

 

Thank you for your time; I look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	immigration

I agree with what's written here. We've spend many a dollar over the years to preserve what we believe in, as much blood has been spilled on many shores to do the same. Now it's time to protect our own shores and remove all those who have entered it illegally and refuse to adapt to the AMERICAN way of life. If these people can pay a coyote $3000 to transport them illegally into our country they can certainly stand in line at the immigration office and do it correctly. If they cannot denounce the country they came from they have no right to be here.
   
   
   
   
  This whole immigration debate has been covered and debated by all the talking heads, but what do real people think and know about immigration?  How does it all affect us and what should we do?  I don’t claim to have those answers, but like most problems, you can turn to history to see the right and wrong way to handle it.  Like most people, the history I know best is my own, and I’d like to share a bit of immigration history from my own life.  
  My Mothers family arrived in the colony of Pennsylvania in the late 1700’s from Germany.  Not sure why they came, I’m sure they just wanted a better life, than what they could have in the “old country”.  I’m not sure what the immigration standards where at that time, but I’m sure they followed what rules and laws there were.  They didn’t stay long in that area, and quickly set out for the frontier of Virginia, know as Kentucky.  My Mother was raised in the area near where her German ancestors settled.  My mom doesn’t speak German, or carry a German flag.  She’s an American.  Red, White and Blue to the core.  4th of July parade watcher, Apple Pie baker, and has been know to grill a good hot dog.
  My Fathers family arrived separately, in the early 1920’s from Wales.  My grandfather arrived first, with his brothers.  They went straight to work, doing all kinds of jobs, like digging ditches, to save enough money to bring over their families from “the old country”.  Since this part of the family immigrated much more recently, I know that they came to the United States to find a better life for their small son, my father.  I really couldn’t tell what the immigration laws were at the time, or how it was done, but I do know that what ever laws and rules were in place my grandfather followed them.  
  My father became a naturalized citizen of the United States of America at a time when the head of the house became a citizen, so did his dependent's.  My father was a fierce patriot, served his country during World War II, and was a highly decorated Air Man.  My father appreciated all things American, and while his parents spoke the Welsh language in private at home, his first and only real language was American English.  He worked hard and graduated from Case Western University after the war, and went on to be a successful businessman.  His love for God, Family, and Country has always been an inspiration to me.
  That’s not where my story ends, because you see I met and married a man from the Philippines, while working on an island in the British West Indies.  I stood in line, 3 months pregnant with him at the United States Embassy while applying for his working papers.  My husband was being transferred by his American company in Florida, since I did not want to have our baby in another country.  
  We waded together through the overwhelming mountains of paperwork and processes necessary to have the legal documentation for a man with a job, and a United States Citizen for a wife.  I do know what that was like, and what it entailed to legally enter the United States of America.  It wasn’t easy, but it was necessary, and we got through it.  
  My husband worked two jobs for many years so that I could stay at home with our two children.  He pays his bills on time, and his tax records are flawless.  He has never received anything from the Government by way of assistance.  He moved from the Green Card status, to Permanent Resident status, where he lingered for some time, and debated applying for citizenship.  That was a huge decision for him to make, and one that I did not want to influence.  
  It is a monumental transformation, to become an American.  It meant that he would no longer be a Filipino.  He would now be of Filipino decent, but once you become an American, that is all you can be.  He understood that, and deliberated carefully.
  My Granny passed away in Kentucky while my husband was still on the fence about his citizenship.  She left behind the small funds necessary for my husband to become a United States Citizen, along with her sincere wish that he become a United States Citizen.  That was the extra little push he needed and in January 1999, my husband proudly renounced his citizenship of the Republic of the Philippines, and took the oath of Citizenship of the United States.
  My husband is a proud, flag waving, card caring registered voter, and American through-and-through.  He is a hard working man, who speaks American English as his first language, even though he was raised to speak another language.  He has melted into the pot, and is as American as his children, who trace their citizenship as far back as the late 1700’s.  
  So what’s the moral of this little story?  What do you take away from my little history?  To me there are 3 very simple principals that stand out:
  1.      People come to the United States of America from all over the world, because they want a better way of life.  It’s not perfect, but it must be better – or they wouldn’t come here!
  2.      We are a nation of laws – that is what makes it better.  Our immigration laws should not be changed to accommodate law breakers.  There are ways to come here legally, and if you can’t do that, then sorry you can’t come.  
  3.      If you want to be truly an American – you follow those laws including immigration and you melt into the big pot of people from all over the world.  You lay down your flags and posters from other places, and you learn to use the language.  You should be proud of your heritage, and you preserve it, but you are an American first and foremost.  
  It just seems so simple to me!  If you’re here by birth, appreciate the sacrifices that were made to get you here.  If you came here on your own, it’s time to melt already, if you haven’t, and appreciate the privilege of being here.  If you are here illegally, get out.  Come back when you can do so with your head held high like so many before you, and legally cross the borders.  Legally work for what you have, and pay taxes to help us stay a great nation.
  It’s time to stand up – even quietly from your busy desk and do something.   If you agree – do something today!  I’m sending this little note to my Congressman, and Senators.  You can do the same!  Us the link below to find out how:  http://www.conservativeusa.org/mega-cong.htm
  It’s time to do something to keep America great, by keeping what great about it!  Benjamin Franklin helped change the new world over 200 years ago by spreading the word of freedom and democracy through his writings.  Not that I’m in his league by any means – but you never know what a few moments and forwarded emails can do!  Help to show the people in power that the people they govern have something to say about their country.
  Thank you!

Subject:	H1 B Visas and Off-Shoring

Governor Bush,

 

I have long been a fan of yours.  I believe that there is no other governor in any state that can handle a crisis situation like you can.

 

What I am contacting you about today is the need to stop the flow of IT jobs out of this country and into the hands of foreign workers.  I never minded competing with other US programmers for jobs that, after all, is the America way.  What I do object to is competing with foreign IT workers.  These workers are not US citizens.  They are not even in the US in a lot of cases.

 

These workers are reported to be better qualified and more skilled than programmers in the US.  I do not for one minute believe this.  We have some of the finest universities in the world while some schools in India and other places are turning out programmers as if they were parts on an assembly line.  They look okay but they are flawed.  They are trained too fast and given just what they need to get by.

 

As a US programmer, I find that it is almost impossible for me to compete with workers from India who are getting paid what we here would consider slave wages.  They are working in what are called body shops (not unlike a sweat shop).

 

Please take some time to research this issue.  Don’t get your information from any source that is currently passing both H1 B visas and off-shoring as the future of IT.  There are many misconceptions and many outright lies.  One of the biggest lies to date is that using H1 B labor will create more jobs.  I have yet to figure out how they come up with that one since if you send programming jobs overseas or give them to workers temporarily in this country and you pay them less, what jobs will that create?  Jobs as overseers?  Not my idea of a fun job, how about you?  Besides you will only need approximately 1 overseer for every 10 to 20 programmers, so that does not sound like a good ratio to me.

 

Our universities have already seen a decline in the number of programmers and other IT fields leaving their doors.  Soon there will be no IT jobs left here in America and we can’t be cutting edge and a leader and innovator in the Tech industry if we have no one to do the dreaming, creating, and innovating.

 

There is a lot more that I could say but I will just make a few suggestions as to where to begin your research.  Check out the contract for hire sites, they are full of Americans competing with foreigners for jobs and usually losing because we can’t charge $1 per hour and make a living.  Check out the job hunting sites, they are full of programmers looking for jobs.  Some of these people have been looking for a job in their chosen field for several years.  Check out sites like Programmers Guild, they have done extensive research and have done their math correctly on the salaries being paid to these workers, the number of jobs leaving this country each year, and have good solid rebuttals to the lies being told to the American people.

 

I understand that you are busy but this issue could mean a bright future for our country or the beginning of the end.

 

Thank you,

 

Tommie Burchfield

Subject:	Property Tax Reform Committee

Dear Governor Bush,

 

It is my understanding that you often read your own email and this is a commendable trait in an elected official, considering most officials are so distant from their constituents.    I am emailing you as a supplemental to my recent application submitted to Celeste Lewis for the Property Tax Reform Committee.

            I am a native Floridian, born in Tampa in 1970.  Though I resided in Atlanta for a few years as a child and went to college in NY, the vast majority of my life has been spent in Florida.  I have extensive family ties in Florida with grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins all residing here.  My family runs the spectrum in types of employment, from retired US Custom's agent to homemaker, from public school teacher to student, from entrepreneur and business owner to career employee with the phone company.   As for myself, I have been involved in the Information Technology industry for 15 years but am undergoing a mid-life career change.  I have been admitted and will be attending Florida State University's College of Law starting this fall. 

            My interest at being on the Property Tax Reform Committee stems from my interest in private property rights.  I was active in a campaign locally to protect private property from abusive eminent domain actions and applauded your signing the state law significantly curtailing such activity.   Property taxes can have similar deleterious effects by forcing owners to take some action.  Whether forcing long time homesteaders to stay in their residence, because they can't afford to move into a similar home with the increased property taxes, or, as the situation existed prior to Save Our Homes, home owners maybe forced to move because they can no longer afford the property taxes on their skyrocketing home values, it must be acknowledged that property taxes have an effect on the free market in real estate.   

            My own interaction with property taxation has been multifaceted.   I have been both a home owner and commercial property owner.  Currently I lease an apartment and am significanty impacted by the property taxes paid by the apartment complex.    I, and other tenants, don't benefit from any form of homesteading or Save Our Homes.  With the recent sale of my commercial property and the cooling off of the home real estate market, I am once again looking to purchase a home and property taxes certainly will have an impact on my decision making process.   

            You'll note, if you review my application, that I am a registered Libertarian.   While I do hold specific philosophical ideas about taxation, I am also a pragmatist.  I will work within the committee to arrive at a practical consensus solution that benefits Florida's citizens, taxpayers and property owners. 

Thank you for considering me in this opportunity to serve the people of Florida.

Subject:	Steven Bromstrop appeal to Clemency Board

Gentlemen:  The Palm Beach Post made reference to Steven Bromstrop, inmate K63957, who has asked the State of Florida Clemency Board to hear his appeal to reduce his sentence to house arrest, so he can become a public speaker and tell young people about his ERROR in judgement.
 
On behalf of all victims of drunk drivers, DO NOT release this person, nor reduce his sentence any further.  His CHOICE on the terrible evening was his alone.  The other young people CHOSE to ride in a car with a SOBER and licensed individual.  Their untimely death
was caused by a person who had no care about his life nor that of other individuals  Miss McKinney will forever be in mental and physical pain when she relives that day.  
 
The families according to the law, regardless of age, sex, or color  DESERVE to see the person who caused their pain, receive the full punishment allowed under the law.  He already has had his sentenced reduced, but apparently this is not sufficient for his so called convenience.
 
Let him and his family continue to have the billboard placed in the community while he endures hs legal sentence.  This visual reminder willl have more impact on the people who see it on a daily basis then one speech.  As a high school teacherI, in the 1980"sI  with the permission  of Wanda Yarboro,my  principal, had the opportunity to lead the FIRST DRUNK DRIVER ASSEMBLY.  We listened to speakers and gave out breathalazers to all the student who in turn PROMISED not to let themselves or their friends drive while intoxicted.
The impact and the message was very emotional and strong.  That is until the next FRIDAY evening when the parties continued.  Martin County has a very high rate of drinking and drug consumtion.  DO NOT send a message to our young people that all you have to do is have money and a GOOD lawyer to get your sentence reduced so you can become a public speaker.    Send the message that  "ALL  Will be punished," (William Shakespeare) who do not obey the law and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  
 
In 1978 my son was hit by a drunk driver, comatosed and in rehab for 18 months.  He lives today with a closed head injury and the loss of his potential.... at that time no laws protected him. The driver who drove at 5:30 in the afternoon got  a slap on the hand and a fine... and we got $10,000 from his insurance company.... A life full of potential taken way for the remainder of his life, dependent on his parents and social security to llive  his life as a  handicapped individual.  So you can see that I have  a stake in this community and the lives of other innocent victims.  DO NOT reduce his sentence or you will make a  laughing stock of this case.

Re: Appointment of Louise B. Zeuli, Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit for Seminole County
 
Dear Sir,
 
My name is Thomas Carter. I am an ex-corporate officer of several different companies in the supply chain / logistics field. My job was to set up and manage companies to manufacture for and supply McDonald’s restaurants in Latin America. I (we) opened Mexico, Brasil, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico to McDonald’s. In the course of my corporate role, I have been to court in several countries and experienced the best and worst of attorneys and judges. Louise Zeuli exemplifies the best of the attorneys and would I believe, carry that over to the bench. 
 
I met her while volunteering in Dispute Resolution Services for the 9th Circuit in Orlando. She too volunteers her time in that circuit as a mediator in civil cases. I have worked with her now for four years. She is one of the very few attorneys that I know, who I would recommend to the bench. 
 
Ms. Zeuli is tireless, energetic, and thoughtful in her decisions. I have never seen an ethical lapse. I am in contact with approximately six or seven attorneys per day and ethical lapses are all too common in their zeal to advocate or protect their own ego. While clearly an articulate and intelligent attorney, Louise has a common touch with parties in dispute resolution conferences. She has the ability and desire to foster self-determination between the parties. She works easily with both attorney and pro-se parties. 
 
A personal observation that I value and find in Louise is that she interacts well with clerical support staff in the court, is patient, and shows them due respect; not a common trait in busy attorneys and judges.
 
While I cannot speak in detail to her technical legal ability, a review of her resume indicates legal experience and leadership roles exceeding many of our current judges. Everything about her indicates she will play an ever expanding role in the community and still be the “best of the best” as a judge. She is the type of judge who will help the 18th Circuit become the icon the 9th Circuit has, “a respected and well known model for judicial practice”.
 
I believe Louise has ideal characteristics for a judge. With her energy, she will be able to handle the all too heavy case load while not losing sight of the humanity of the parties. She is compassionate but will enforce the rule of law. 
 
It is difficult to find truly qualified people like Louise who are willing to make the sacrifices necessary to serve on the bench. We will all be better off if Louise is appointed to the 18th Circuit Court Bench. 
 
Please do not let this opportunity escape us. Louise Zeuli will bring tireless energy, ethics, honor, and respect to the position of Circuit Judge in the 18th Circuit.
 
Appoint Louise B. Zeuli, Esquire to the Circuit Court Bench in the 18th Judicial Circuit for Seminole County. 
 
 
Respectfully, 
 
 
Thomas C. Carter

To Whom It May Concern:
 
I am a close family friend of Pamela Reynolds, who has been imprisoned now for over a year, she was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence for a drug offense, she has been denied her appeal and now was denied a sentence modification.  Pam is a first time offender with a record of good behavior while serving her time. She is 53 years old and has led a pure, honest good life until this incident.  A family woman , a treasured loyal friend, a caring compassionate person who has done so much for others all her life. I   appreciate your giving me your time to hear my plea for justice. 
 
First I want to tell you that I have seen the destruction drugs and the lifestyles attendant thereto produce. It is a terrible and painful thing to witness and unfortunately too many of us have been close enough to those who have made these mistakes. It hurts so many that have nothing to do with that lifestyle, yet love those who have fallen. 
 
My friend has made a serious mistake in her life and better than anyone she knows this. Her mistake has led to a lot of pain for herself, her family and friends. All of us are anguished by this and wish she had had the resolve to not have fallen. However we cannot change the past and must look to the future with the hope that her life will regain the positive direction she has always maintained. 
 
I  would like to take this moment to tell of this woman’s accomplishments, filled with a great deal of unselfish work for others. Her commitment and devotion as a teacher for almost thirty years and also as a coach. Pam lived for her students, she helped so many for so many years never wavering always putting others needs ahead of her own.  Pam  a caregiver to an ailing aunt who had Alzheimer’s disease,  she moved her in with her to allow for her final years to be filled with love and comfort. Pam is a wonderful Mother and grandmother to her daughter Megan and her three grandson’s all who have different degrees of MS.  Pam’s absence in their lives is now what is most painful. The absence of their grandmother during these early years is not something that could ever be replaced. This year and a half has already been too much.   A volunteer in her community for many events, for years Pam was always there ready to help.   She has overcome some of life’s hardest challenges, serious life threatening illnesses to herself, her Mom, Daughter and Grandchildren, cancer has plagued her and her family,  losing her youngest sister to a battle with cancer just a few years ago. She is a woman with a  very big heart always helping others, a kind compassionate, loving woman this is who Pam is. Anyone who knows her knows this of her.
 
My friend had no record prior to this and will  never  cross such a line again.   She knows her mistake has caused all of us great pain and is more than remorseful. All of us Pray for her daily and need her back home with us. For we all in a sense have been punished to a different kind of imprisonment. The pain is deep and the loss is great. 
 
 I just hope that you can see the person I know and see that there is the hope and promise of redemption for her.  Be certain that my friend will walk the path back to freedom from this evil and be grateful for a chance to begin rebuilding her life.
 
I am not familiar with these matters and wish I never had to write this letter, but as a friend and a Christian I have a duty to her (and society). Knowing her I know she is not only remorseful, but repentant and willing to do anything the court would mandate to regain her life. She has given to so many for so long. I hope that you can see the good in her even now, while incarcerated Pam has been a mentor to many.  Helping others, tutoring them, assisting in the teaching and education of those less fortunate. Just speak with the teacher she assists at Gadsden Correctional and hear what he has to say of her.
 
We are already paying the price drugs cost us in so many ways, having Pam incarcerated is not helping anyone. 
 
You have a task I would never wish to have, one that balances justice with compassion, truly it must be a difficult one indeed. I place my trust in You and Pray for Him to grant you wisdom and guidance in this matter. 
 
Please I beg for any guidence to allow for  parole or for clemancy to be given now.
 

Respectfully submitted,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
An article in our local paper, Venice Gondolier, sparked my interest....as I am manager of a real estate office and licensed to sell real estate, the current state of real estate being what it is, I think exploring real estate taxes is a great idea.....

Dear Governor Bush:
My name is Schmeka Walker I am a thirty year mother of two, struggling to survive in today's society. About nine years ago my husband, cousin, and I had an argument over a personal issue. And things got out of hand, the police were called by me and I ended up getting arrested. I had did nothing wrong other than being hurt and disappointed in the two of them. And when I asked them to leave my mother's property over seven they insisted on dis cussing the issue and proceeded to enter the property. When inside I was choked and held against my will. when I escaped I ran to my neighbor's house and called the police. By the time they arrived I was in the front yard waiting, while being taunted and called names by the both of them. When approached by the police I was to upset to talk so he asked me to sit in the back of the car to calm down. and he went over and spoke to the both of them after awhile he came over to the car opened the door "I replied Thank you!" and got out of the car He placed my arms behind me and told me I was being arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. I had a breakdown in the back seat and all of this was done in front my five year old daughter and my five month old son. To make a long painful story short, I bailed out, obtained a lawyer lost my job over it, couldn't afford the lawyer and their advice to me was to change my plea from not guilty to guilty and take the withheld adjudication and eighteen months of probation. The lawyer told me I would never have a record and it wouldn't affect my job. All that was a lie and for the next four years, I couldn't obtained a decent job over eight dollars per hour. I was young,scared,and uninformed and I trusted my lawyer when he only wanted to break even after knowing I lost my job. This was my first offense and the original charge was decreased, only to discover this would follow and haunt me the rest of my life. Right now I am a divorced preschool teacher struggling I am enrolled in college to become certified teacher with The Broward County School Board. And last year this case was heard before The Broward County Child Care Licensing Agency with taped testimony from my husband and I that he and my cousin lied out of anger and spite. My record was sealed only within Broward County and only for child care facilities. It is hard to apply for a lease or a decent job and I am trying to better my self for my kids and to be a voice and example to single mother's every where that we can succeed in life with hard work and determination. And to send a message to people every where that justice still prevails no matter how long its been. I never got my right to a fair trial I was innocent of the charge and still am, I just want what every American wants a life for me and my children. I am asking you to help me obtain or grant me a pardon. I promise with the help of God I will work hard and do whatever it takes to follow through stipulations,rules,court preceding and I will travel if I have to. The life that my children and I could have is in your hands please I beg you to consider the life we have right now full of struggle, heartache and tears when I think of where we should be in life right now. More so God has given me a gift and talent with children, and there is a great need of teachers that care about the welfare of the child not just a paycheck. I have the heart of teacher If I can't teach I don't know what else I would do. I also plan to relocate to Georgia after college to purchase my first home for my children and I. And it would be a waste of time and money, to go to college and not gain employment because of my background. Please take into consideration that I am a positive influence in my community, church and family. PLEASE HELP ME TO PURSUE MY DREAMS AND WALK INTO MY DESTINY!!!!!!!
