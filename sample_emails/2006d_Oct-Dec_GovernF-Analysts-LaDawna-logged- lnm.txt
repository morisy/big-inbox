To the Honorable Jeb Bush:

The staff of People in the Community sponsored a Men 
& Women Conference on December 1st and 2nd in 
celebration of the impact we have had in touching so 
many lives in a positive way for the past six years.

This was our first celebration after the existence of our 
online  (2000) and the newspaper/magazine (2002). I 
am sorry, that I didn't get information to you in advance 
but we would like to have a letter of commemoration 
from you for our memorabilia since you have been a 
part of our publication. Please view online at 
http://www.PeopleintheCommunity.com/Conf.htm

I know you have met so many people, since you 
became Governor, but I will forever remember our nice 
chat while buying groceries one Sunday after church at 
Winn Dixie on Magnolia.

I wish you and our First Family of Florida much 
success.

Dear Governor Bush:

I would like to request for a “greetings” letter from the respectable Governor for inclusion in our Christmas Souvenir Program. Our Filipino American Association of SW Florida Annual Christmas Charity Ball will be on December 23, 2006 at La Venezia Ballroom in Cape Coral from 6p to 10p.  

 

The Filipino American Association is a 501 c 3 organization which aims to promote unity, camaraderie and goodwill amongst the members of the community. 

Our goals are aimed towards building funds for our educational scholarship, civic, social as well as cultural projects in SW Florida. We also raise funds to help the needy and the sick in our own country- the Philippines.

We have participated in the International Presentation at Gulf Coast University this year to promote the Philippines. We have participated in many various projects where our country is featured.

We have given rewards to deserving students with our 123- ABC Project when students present their report cards. 

 

Our deadline for the submission for printing is December 10 , 2006.

 

Thanks for your help.

Can you send me a copy of the format? Who is introducing Speaker Rubio?
 
Have we provided talking points to Speaker Rubio's office?
 
How many tables, confirmations (to date)?
 
What time is the speaker expected to arrive/depart? The Speaker has another engagment and we need to make sure he is in and out in one hour.
 
Who is sitting at the Speakers table?
 
Are all the HBCU Presidents confirmed to attend?
 
Let me know where we are.

Jackie, I spoke with Amber last week. Things are still on target for the December 1st lunch. The request from the Tampa chapter to do something in February caused a little hick-up, but I think things are straight. I don't think the Speaker will be able to do both lunches (given the close proximity in time). I would imagine his staff will look at the request but it's probably going to be difficult to make them both work.
 
Speaker Rubio is very supportive of UNCF and wants to be as helpful has possible, but his time is just like the Governor's--very precious.
 
I told Amber I planned to attend the lunch (we need to make sure the Speaker is in and out in during the designated hour).
 
Talking points. We need to get the info to Amber and/or Bill to include in Speaker Rubio's remarks.
Can you send me the latest/greatest on tables sold, confirmations (attendees), program format (mc, who is introducing the speaker, etc.)
 
We should probably try to set up a time to have a conference call with Amber. I'm traveling this week, but perhaps early next week.
 
I'll touch base with Amber and see what works for her.
 
Looking forward to Dec. 1st.

On December 19th over 1,500 leading philanthropists and community leaders from throughout the U.S. will participate in the International Awards Dinner of Colel Chabad Lubavitch in the New York Hilton.

 

Colel Chabad will honor noted philanthropist Alex Blavatnik of Aventura, Florida. Yonit Duchman of Miami, Florida will receive the Aishes Chayil Award. 

 

The event will pay tribute to the late Captain Hyman Galbut of blessed memory, a Naval Captain and WWII veteran. Captain Galbut’s four sons are all leading doctors and lawyers in the Miami area who are dedicated to philanthropic causes both in Florida, New York and Israel. The evening will be chaired by Mr. Russell Galbut, one of the principals of Crescent Heights, Inc, a prominent real estate development firm operating throughout the US, with headquarters in your fine State of Florida. 

 

Colel Chabad was established some 200 years ago by the founder of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, of blessed memory.  It is the oldest continuous charity in Israel, whose purpose is to provide spiritual, material and social support for the less fortunate regardless of affiliation or background through a wide network of day care centers, soup kitchens, holiday subsidies for poor families, widows and orphans fund, job retraining for new Russian immigrants, and much more. 

 

We would be honored if the Senator would share in this special event through a greeting to Mr. Alex Blavatnik, Mrs. Yonit Duchman and dinner chairman, Mr. Russell Galbut. 

 

May Almighty G-d bless you both materially and spiritually and may you see much success in all your endeavors. And may G-d bless America!

Shirley was President of our club in 2001 and 2002, when we ran into a snag in 2006, Shirl stepped in again to be President.
 
I think you know how much she has done for the Republican Party in Florida and in Lee County.  She has been a tireless supporter of the Bush family.  If you could write something for me to read at the December 20 meeting, we would really appreciate it.  She says she is retiring to the sidelines.

Governor Bush,
                           On behalf of Connected by 25 project I am writing you to ask you to write a letter of support for our Walk-A-Mile project. Cby25 has partnered with DCF and from November 13 through December 15 we will ask our state and local policy makers to partner with a youth aging-out of foster care.
 
We hope that both the policy maker and the foster care youth will come away from the Walk-A-Mile experience with a better understanding of each others lives.
 
We would utilize your support letter as an attachment to our invitations for our policy makers.
 
If you have any questions we can be reached at teen@hillsboroughkids.org or 813-314-2070.
 
Thank you again,
Ashley Kyle

RE:  Request for a “congratulations” letter
Honorable; Gov. Jeb Bush
 
 
On behalf of The Art Institute of Weston, I respectfully request your assistance.
 
            We are approaching our 5th Anniversary and we are publishing a hardcover yearbook for our students/parents and we would like your participation in this project, through a letter of congratulations.
 
            Our Master Artist Conchita Firgau has dedicated her life to teaching children and adults the skills of visual arts, especially the Classic Traditional European Style of Painting. As the founding member of the Institute she has trained our 18 teachers and today we have almost 500 students (478) due to her effort and dedication.
 
            As you may remember, on your visit to Weston in 2002 the International Chamber of Commerce presented you with a very special 3D painting by Conchita.
 
South Florida has benefited tremendously in having such a Master Artist willing to teach and share her knowledge with everyone that comes to the Art Institute of Weston.
 
            In our State of Florida there are no other Institutions that specialize in the teaching of this Realistic Style of paining. She was trained in Spain, at the same Art school where Master Artists like Dali and Picasso were students.
 
Young children as early as 5 years old, come to the Institute where they learn the love of art, and develop the fine-motor skill, concentration, and self pride through the arts, one of the basic foundations to become a better contributor to our community.
 
I would be very pleased to provide you with any further information and be available if you have any questions.
 
Our website is;

Most Respectfully yours

Dear Mr. Bush:

        Greetings! My name is Jennifer Aboderin I am a Coordinator for a National Youth Organization known as the Holiness Young Peoples Auxiliary (H.Y.P.A).  The purpose of the H.Y.PA. is to build high standards of Christian Character among young people and to nurture and develop potential leaders. The H.Y.PA is composed of highly motivated individuals up to the age of twenty- five, each year around the Thanksgiving holiday the auxiliary holds its national conference in cities throughout the United States. This conference is a very high-paced, action oriented affair, providing seminars with a wide range of national and international speakers and facilitators. Also the conference offers educational fieldtrips, tours of outstanding landmarks in the country, and individual input and participation in oratorical contest, spelling bees, and talent programs.

     The 2006 National S.M.M.A/ H.Y.PA. Conference will convene in the state of Florida in the beautiful city of West Palm Beach, November 22-24th.  This conference will definitely have an impact on Palm Beach County in terms of revenue. I would like for our Governor to extend a warm welcome to the conference delegates by drafting a letter which we will include in our program booklet. We would also like to include an official picture with your signature. Thank you for taking time to consider to this very important cause, your contribution and generosity is greatly appreciated. I would like to commend you Governor Bush for your outstanding service to the state of Florida for the past eight years. May god bless you and your family.

Dear Friends,

 

The importance of ABiCC is constantly growing in Florida, and it has now taken the role of a strong leader in defending the interests of the international business community. Florida is the ideal location for international and global business, whether it is in finance, trade or tourism, and it is therefore essential that we create the ideal climate to invite further international companies to establish their base for the Americas in our State. The role of ABiCC has now become essential in helping Florida to set the right climate for these invaluable corporations. ABiCC unites countries from all continents of the world, showing that strength comes from unity and cooperation.

 

I am proud to see the numerous world leaders that have been keynote speakers at ABiCC's events, and I am delighted to see that the President of IDB Mr Luis Alberto Moreno is the Guest of Honor at your upcoming Installation Dinner, and will be receiving the well know ABICC Award for Leadership in Global Trade 2006. 

 

I would here like to congratulate the new directors of ABiCC for their recent nomination, and I would like to wish them a successful and prosperous year. I commend the directors of the board for their many hours of hard work and dedication, and would like to thank you for your voluntary and invaluable contributions to our international business community.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jeb Bush
