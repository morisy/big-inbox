Dear Governor Bush:

Please do all you can to keep the laws and Beliefs of our Forefathers in 
the Rules and Laws of the America we believe in. This country has faltered 
because this is no longer done, and we Need to be back where the 50 State 
Preambles all Speak of God and Our trust in Him.

My forefathers farmed here since the early 1720's and this is wrong that 
foreign immigrants are trying to run this Country.

We are allowing the Freedom of Speech to change all the Laws and 
Amendments.

Please do what you are able to help = have your leaders vote to stop this
and be straight and narrow to the Christian Belief that God will aid us.
Thank you for listening.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Governor,

     I recently heard the events that made me relize that we as americans 
have taken the removale of church and state to an level that is alarming.  
Our country was founded upon prayer.  Letting this congress man swearing 
in on his own "bible" is a slap in america's face.  Our forefathers worked 
hard for a land that was founded on bibical knowelge.  You had to take an 
oath on the holy bible upon your swearing in didn't you?  Why should you 
let some of different faith take americas' traditions and throw them out 
of the window.   Look deep down inside of our heart.  Listen to our 
forefathers turning in their graves looking at america now.  I know that 
it only takes one voice to turn events.  Let your voice be heard as I am 
letting you know my thoughts.  Yes you are just one man but I am only one 
women who knows when to make the holy bible a place in our swearing in 
cermonies.  God placed you in a place of leadership for a time that 
Floridians need you most.  This time is now.  I'm asking you look in the 
mirror and ask yourself who are you.  Than make your decission.  Thank you 
for taking the time to read this Email.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Senator, I am really appauled that the idea should even be 
considered. I am not a racist by any means but I believe that anyone 
living in the United States of America should take any oath for Local, 
State, or Federal on the book that our country was founded on. That book 
and I know you know is our Bible,God's Holy Word. For anyone to take an 
oath of office on any other book will not only open the door for others to 
try to do the same thing but will be a slap in our face! If someone has a 
problem with taking an oath on the Bible they should not be considered for 
any office! You would not do that in another country and shouldn't. If I 
moved to another country and became a citizen then I pledge my alegiance 
to that country and I would be expected to take an oath on the book that 
they would use. Enough is enough! God's Holy Word is our book that we take 
an oath of office on, let's not let someone change that too!

Dear Governor Bush:

Keith Ellison, D-Minn., the first Muslim elected to the United States 
Congress, has announced that he will not take his oath of office on the 
Bible, but on the bible of Islam, the Koran. 

He should not be allowed to do so -- not because of any American hostility 
to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization. 

First, it is an act of hubris that perfectly exemplifies multiculturalist 
activism . Mr. Bush, I am totally 1000% against this action. He should not 
be able to use the koran to be sworn in. I know you are on a state level, 
but we need safeguards in the state of Florida also.

Dear Governor Bush:

A first for America…The Koran replaces the Bible at the swearing-in oath

I ask that you introduce and help get passed a law making the Bible the 
book to be used in swearing in Representatives, Senators, the President 
and Vice-President and other public officials.

Why are the Unites States government people in the senate and congress 
{democrats not republicans} doing everything to show the whole world how 
the United States will do everything to keep every other country strong 
with their government beliefs and religious beliefs and extremely willing 
to throw our own away in a shallow show that we would rather adopt their 
ways rather than stand strong for our own like we want them to stand 
strong for their own?  

It's truly sad and scary that the democrats believe that if they smile at 
all other countries and give them everything they want and give up 
everything that is, or has been the USA, that, that is some how 
"intelligent politics", but the truth is, all these other countries are 
laughing at how weak our government has showed themselves, immediately 
willing to give up everything that our history shows made us great and 
calling ourselves strong to the world in this way.

I truly believe that if today's United States were to go to war with the 
world war II United States and weaponry being equal, that the government 
and people of the United States in WWII being much stronger with the God 
and Jesus Christ of Israel in their beliefs would wipe out the United 
States of today, as more than half of our government leaders today are 
atheist's and rebellious against God {they don't care he exists or they 
have created a God in their own image} and more USA citizens today do not 
even believe or care to believe in the God of Israel at all.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you on this matter 
of importance to my family and me.

My grandfather came to America from Lebanon and raised his family here  as 
Moslems, yet my father as a soldier pledged allegiance to his country as 
well as when he took legal oaths sworn on the bible as that is the holy 
book of this great nation. 

We were taught to honor and obey the laws of our government.  ALSO, we are 
taught as Moslems that Christians and Jews are people of the book (Bible) 
and we are to respect them.  I know that is not happening amoungst some 
Molems!

There is nothing correct in dishonoring the Holy book of America, it is 
the foundation that gives us all the wonderful liberties this nation has 
over all countries.

Keith Ellison, D-Minn. should swear his oath of office on the on the 
Bible, he is first of all an American citizen, no matter what his faith.

I came across an article where Keith Ellison (D-Minn) wants to be sworn in using the Koran not the Bible. I think this is a terrible precedent to be setting. This country was founded on the principles of the Bible. Jews have been sworn in using the Bible without believing in the New Testament without complaint.

 

Please do the right thing and stand up for what is right. Do not let this nonsense continue. Talk to your brother and please convince him that this is so very wrong and have him speak out against it.
