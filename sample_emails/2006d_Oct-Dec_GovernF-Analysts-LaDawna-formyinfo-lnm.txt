Dear Governor Bush:
   I e-mailed your office early September and received a response that very evening!     Needless to say I was quite surprised.   Unfortunately, the answer I received was just a run-around.  
 
   15% of my Social Security is being taken out of me because of a glitch in the system that Social Security says is a State problem, and the State says it's a federal problem.  Meanwhile I'm left without means to support myself.
 
   I humbly ask, could you feed, cloth and shelter yourself on $534.50 per month, Governor Bush?      Praise God for my church family!
 
   PLEASE HELP ME
