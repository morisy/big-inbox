To whom it may concern,

My name is Leslie Galvez, I am currently 25 years old, married with 2 children (a girl who is 6 years old and a little boy who is 2 years old), I became a Permanent Resident in October 2006, I have lived in this country since 2002 and I would like to be a Police Officer, I understand that in order to become one, I need to be an American Citizen, unfortunately that will happen in October 2009, I am married to a US citizen and that is why it will be 3 years until I can become a citizen, I felt so frustrated when I tried to get a job close to what I want to do the most..."to work at the police station"... even if it was only the filing clerk, but I was not eligible because... I am not a citizen, I am currently unemployed, I lost my job before Christmas and I was not able to get one, I want to be a Police Officer with a passion, so I can give my kids a better future and also to set an example of persistance and to follow your dream till the end, I know and I have heard many people say: ..."but it's only 3 years..." but to me it can't wait that long, at least maybe I could study and start getting ready to do it but again... it's a requirement to be a US citizen.

I am sending this email looking for somekind of assistance in order to see if I could accelerate the process of being a US citizen or if there is a different solution to this problem, I love this country and I want to contribute to PROTECT and SERVE other floridians like me and I want to be admired by my children who will look up to me and follow my steps, I don't want to be "just" an office clerk, I have a dream, and I hope you can help me make it become TRUE!!!

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

Dear Gov. Jeb Bush:
 
I am a resident of Ft. Lauderdale, my name is James Wm. Pandeli.  I was hoping that you might relay a message to your brother, the President.  
 
It is not us that he should be talking to about the war in Iraq, nor the Iraqi leadership.  He should be talking directly to the Iraqi people including the insurgents (whether Iraqis or others) of the consequences if they do not allow the US to establish a new Iraqi nation.  He should make clear that it is OUR national interests and a very important matter to us.  He should allow a possible senario if they, the Iraqis, do not appreciate this fact. 
 
Presently, we are moving at too slow a pace, and the massacred of US troops is unacceptable.  We appear too incompetent and the Arab world is laughing at us.  The President should allow advisors who understand things apparently a lot better than he does  (no disrepect intended.) and most present advisors, including the military.  I cannot begin to tell you of things I have analyzed without benefit of CIA or other information...just through a reasoning process.
 
Allow me to give one example.  When Zarqawi was killed in Bakuba, Iraq, the information of his whereabouts was given to us over the TV before the fact.  In the films from al Jazeera we saw Osama walking around the mountains with a walking cane.  Another film showed Zarqawi shotting a gun and in the background was a level surface.  In Swahili, the first three letters of 'walking cane' is 'bak', and the first three letters of 'flat surface' is 'uba'.  Bingo...Bakuba!
 
Thank you for your attention, and I wish you and your family well.

Subject:	Social Security Disability

Recently I saw on the news that Florida and maybe particularly the Tampa Bay area, ranks number 1 in the country as the slowest to issue Social Security Disability decisions.  For that reason I am writing to you not only for myself, but any others in our state who are in my situation.

 

I filed for SSD in March 2002 and was denied twice and finally had a hearing on March 16, 2005. During that hearing the judge asked that I accept my disabled date as my 50th birthday (Oct.2003) instead of when I lost my job in May 2002.  My attorney and I went downstairs to confer with my husband about it.  Upon our return to chambers, no more than 25 minutes later, the door was locked.  The bailiff told us that the Judge, his assistant and the vocational expert went to lunch because they got tired of waiting and couldn't find us. Those three people couldn't wait to have lunch for 25 minutes but I've had to wait for nearly 5 years for a decision to get financial aid from a government program into which I paid for 30 years?

 

I had a new hearing in May 2005 and was then denied SSD in Nov. 2005. My attorney promptly filed and appeal. In order to prepare for the appeal hearing my attorney has requested transcripts of the hearings but has only been sent the May 3,2005 records as if the March 16th hearing never took place! There are many more disturbing details concerning this case that I won't go into here.

  

Needless to say, this almost five years without income has been disastrous on my health and our financial lives. I've heard of people dying before their cases are settled with SSA.  I will not die from my condition but I will have it the remainder of my life and will need medical treatment from now on.  

 

In summary, can you help me find a way to move this along?  I don't know who judges report/answer to but, how can they treat people this way? Please let me know if you or your office can help me and how.

 

Thank You.

Subject:	Request to Expedite Name Check Application with FBI on Adjustment of Status Application

Sub: Requesting your kind assistance in expediting my FBI Name Check 

Respected Governor of Florida, 

Mr. Jeb Bush,

I am working as Finance Program Manager with Siemens Communications Incorporated at Boca Raton, Florida ( A Fortune 50 Company). Prior to arriving at USA, I had been working with Siemens Canada Limited, as Manager Financial Analysis. All my working life, I have worked with Siemens Group of Companies. I am writing this letter to bring to your attention the problem related to my Adjustment of status (I-485) petition. Me and my family filed applications for permanent residency (I-485) under the Multinational Manager/Executive category on June 6th. , 2006, My I-140 was approved on January 25th. of 2006. 

However the I-485 application has not been approved so far. I have technical difficulties in traveling abroad to attend meetings and conferences, since my I-485 is pending. On the family side also, they have difficulties traveling abroad to visit relatives in India. 

I enquired several times with the USCIS (California Service Center) and got the answer that the case is awaiting security clearance since June 2006. The FBI claims that all security checks are completed in most cases in 90 days. I tried to contact FBI, but they do not answer telephone anymore. I understand that the name check process is an essential requirement for national security. But I am concerned about the extremely long period of time it takes to complete the security check. It is deleterious both for national security as well as for the applicant. It would be ideal if the security check can be done in a reasonable time frame, which will increase its efficiency as a national security tool. The expedition of the process will also help the applicant to enjoy his privileges as a permanent resident. 

Therefore I request you most humbly to obtain information regarding the status of my name check with the FBI, and request the FBI to expedite the process. I declare and certify under penalty of perjury that I have not involved in any criminal activities in my life. 

 

The details for my case is provided below: 

Name of the primary applicant: Prinitesh Bhattacharya 

Address: 21355, Town Lakes Drive, Apartment # 1412, Boca Raton, Florida 33486 

Date of Birth: August 2nd. 1965

Country of citizenship: Canada

Mr. Jeb Bush: 
      My name is Jaime Aveytia and have been serving my country in the U.S Navy for 10 years. 
     I applied for my citizenship in 2005  and completed all my interviews by early 2006. I went back to check on the status of my application in March 2006 because I was going to be leaving to Kuwait City for my next station-- HS-15 Navy Air Ambulance.  My Legal Officer in my command advised me that since I would be leaving, I should put my application on hold in case that I would be called upon, it wouldn't be held against me as failure to show.  

So that is what I did. When I got down to Kuwait City,  I tried to have all my documents send down there so I can finish up with my citizenship; however, they told me that they were still waiting on my background check.  

     At that time, my Command Legal told me that I had to wait, so I did, and still am.   I came back from Kuwait City on November 23, 2006, after being away  from my family for a little over 6 months.  During this period of time, many of my fellow Sailors became U.S. citizens in a period of 3-6 months and I am still waiting...As a matter a fact, I went to the INS office to check the status of my application, and to my surprise, I am still waiting on the FBI to complete my background check. 

     I understand that to become a U.S. citizen there is a process to go by.  My question to you is "If I can serve my country in a time of war, recieved awards for my performances, served faithfully for 10 years, had my wife and two daughters waiting for me for 3 tours, doesn't it seem foolish to be cleared through my whole U.S Citizenship application except my Background check?  And that is all I am waiting for?"

     Mr. Bush, I don't really know if you are the person that I have to contact about this. I am asking for you help on my case.  I already consider my self a proud American and serve my country with honor, I just don't have it on paper.  Please help.

     I appreciate your time.  Thank you in advance.

Subject:	A few questions

Jeb Bush,
 
First of all, I hope that you had a Merry Christmas.  I actually have a question about what is going on right now  with the swearing in of Keith Ellison, the first Muslim member of Congress.  Is there anthing in the constitution that does not allow to get sworn in by another religious book?  
My thinking has guided me to this.  By allowing another book other than the bible, this may cause a slippery slope in which some may want to be sworn in by books for example like the Jedi(Star Wars) code(do not know if that is real)and may lead to diminishing the sworn testimony or oath.  I guess this could also lead to changes for all other sworn testimony.
I just do not see why though that someone would not allow a muslim or rabbi to be sworn in by the book that they would hold to the greatest degree of respect, and how the united states with the freedom of religion would not allow or uphold that sworn oath.
I feel like I am being pulled from both sides, and not making any ground on the subject.  Please help.  Any insight would be valuable;even if it does not pull just for one side
 
Thank you,

Gov. Bush,
 
I have been associated with two children, ages 18 and 16 who has just found out that they are on the deportation list.
 
They were not aware of this.  They are originally from St. Maarten and have lived in Florida for about 10 years.  They have no father and their mother was working on their US citizenship when suddenly she passed away 5 years ago.  Both children were young and believed that their Uncle had taken on the responsibility of their citizenship.  Unfortunately he did not.
 
These are wonderful, beautiful children and had no idea this has happened.  IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT!  THEY WERE CHILDREN!.
 
The 18 year old lives with my family now and all he wants is to go to college, get a job and be able to drive.  
 
Could you be of any assistance to how I can help this kids get citizenship.  I would be happy to provide any information you need.
 
We have gone to Senator Martinez's office and they tried to help but were told there is nothing they can do.  I have the paperwork stating this.
 
Please let me know what I can do.

Dear Mr Bush,
     I would like to begin by thanking you for your years of service to the state of Florida.  Your leadership has sparked changes in the state that will keep us moving in a positive direction.  Your support during difficult times, like the hurricanes, will be remembered by many for years to come. 

     I am also writing to you to ask a favor.  My daughter has been selected by her school to travel, with a group of 36 students, to travel to Washington DC this spring where they will perform at the Kennedy Center.  They will be in Washington from March 23 until March 28, 2007.  They are being invited to perform because our school, Cypress Elementary School, in Kissimmee, is the first Florida school to be awarded the National Creative Ticket award.  This award is presented to schools who effectively integrate the arts into the daily lives of the student body.  We have applied to get permission for the group to tour the White House, but I would love to research the possibility of having the students be able to meet with the President or the First Lady.  Would you be willing to help us see if that would be a possibility?  

   I have attached a photograph of my daughter, in a much younger form,  being held by your mother at a campaign rally in Orlando.  I would love to be able to see if she would be willing to sign a copy of the photo for her scrap book, but am not really sure where to send it.  If it would not be too great of a difficulty, could you also tell me where to send the picture? 

   Again, I thank you for your years of service to the state of Florida.  I pray that God blesses you in your future endeavors.

dear sir
I have been a green card resident since 1963 and retired to florida in 98 . in 2006 I got remarried to a german national in key west, when she visited on a 3 month visa.
at present I have filed through an attorney my citizen papers and her application for a green card . since her visa ran out in oktober she had to return to germany. I also was told that she could not reenter into the usa  for  1 year or till I get my American citizen ship. I think this is rather inhumane to keep to married people apart when we are both over 60 years old and retired . she has her own income , 3 married daughter with 5 grand children .
I would like to know if there is any way she could enter the usa on vacation for an extended time so we could be together till i receive my citizen ship which at that time will give her a green card in 3 to 4 weeks I hope.
I would greatly appreciate any assistance you could give me .

At the beginning of her sentence, I had contact with the bureau of prisons on her behalf.  But I was told that any consideration for her release or parole was way too early.  But now she has served over half her sentence, and I need to know who to contact in regards to a possible release for her.  She has a family back in Athens, Georgia who need her desperately.  2 young daughters.  Your brother, The President, is the one who gives pardons.  As I know that I cannot talk directly to him on her behalf, could you?  Being his brother, this would speed up the process greatly.  I thank you kindly for any consideration on her behalf.

PLEASE
 
THIS IS SOMETHING I AM NOT TAKING LIGHTLY.  IF THIS MAN PASSES (DIES) 
WITHOUT HIS DUE HONORS - IT SHALL BE COME MY LIFES PATH TO FOLLOW, NO 
MATTER THE STRUGGLES, BRING ATTENTION TO THIS FORGOTTEN ISSUE. NO MATTER 
HOW HIGH, NO MATTER WHOM I WILL REACH AND CONTINUE UP THE LINE, BRINING IT 
TO OUR GOVERNMENT, SENATES, LOCAL OFFICALS, AS HIGH AS IT MUST GO - TO 
SPEAK FOR THE ONES NOW TO OLD (IF NOT ALREADY PASSED ON) TO RECIEVE THIS 
SIMPLE REQUEST.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE ARE TODAY WHAT THESE MEN FOUGHT 
FOR - AMERICA.
 
I was told about this A WW11 veteran named Roy Robinson, by another 
veteran. The other veteran told me of the severe torture Mr.Robinson 
endured while serving the freedom and good of his country. I asked to met 
Mr.Robinson. 
 
During my encounter with Mr. Robinson, just to shake his hand. He not 
once, spoke of his war time afflictions. But this when I saw the saddness 
and hurt in this mans eyes. I found out the listed below reason for this:
 
He mentioned one thing trying to get his medals. He'd contacted a couple 
of veteran facilities in order that he could receive his (in my words - 
DUE ACCOMMODATIONS) medals.  
 
Mr. Roy Robinson is a sickly man. Yet he sits at a tiny flea market, in 
the cold selling bits and pieces. I do believe Mr. Robinson's days are 
few. 
 
I  AM VERY ANGER:  This man - has not received, nor heard any response 
regarding: possibly the only meaningful thing in his life.  
 
These medals made of something simple, maybe tin - But could be what 
enables him to on knowing what he stands for and believes in - America.
 
My words: without the men, long ago, fighting for our country, is what has 
enabled us to be were we are today!?!
  
In Mr. Robinsons finally days, could it not be so simple as to 
complete/grant this request!?! To give him his finally happiness!
 
Saddness this fills my heart.
 
I sent this information to you on December 6th and have heard no reply. I 
even requested where to be directed!
 
ROY L ROBINSON:  34-541-897;  4129TH QUARTERMASTER SERVICE COMPANY, 
HONRABLE DISCHARGE, 25 NOVEMBER 25, 1945.  BORN 12 FEB 1922.  SERVED IN 
WW11.
 
If it is that the medals must be PURCHASED, which is outlandish - I will 
from my personal social sercuity check due the honors of paying for them.
 
SINCERELY, REGRATEFULLY,

I was not asking for a major intervention.  My sisters immigration process has come to the final stage of issuing the visa after having come  from Baghdad  for it. She went through the interview and was told she will hear from them in 2-6 weeks. It has been more than 7 weeks . Having made the dangerous bus ride from Baghdad to Amman,  she is sitting in Amman waiting, afraid that if she returns to Baghdad to wait for the visa, after going through the dangerous bus ride to Baghdad, she will have to come back to Amman when the visa is issued. I don't believe the counselete workers in Amman realize how much risk people endure  when they travel the Baghdad - Amman route. I was hoping for a friendly reminder to the counselete workers to speed up the issuance of the visa, in case it is laying forgotten on someones desk. Have a Merry Christmas.

> Dear Governer Bush ,    My name is Siham K Toma , I am a retired physician ,after serving St. Johns County for 33 years . I need  your  help in a very urgent matter. In 1954  I applied for immigration  for two sisters I have living in Iraq . Finally after years of waiting they were advised to come for visa interview.My sister Wafa  Naman  was given a date for November 5th, 2006   and Faiza Naman, my older ister, who is  72  years old  , a date for March 19, 2007,  without any consideration for how difficult it is for anybody to make the trip from Baghdad to Amman . My sister Wafa took the bus to Amman ,leaving my other sister back  in Baghdad. She did her visa interview and was told that they will let her know in few weeks.She has been waiting since  November 5th to hear from them,and is becoming very desperate not knowing whether she should return to  Baghdad or stay and  wait ,while being  worried about my other sister who is 72 years old . Could you please help facilitate their immigration. We are christian family, in the spirit of this holly season , and good will,  I ask for your help. All my sisters are looking for is to get to see their family here..

Please tell your brother that there are a lot of Americans very proud to have him as president of our country. He has brought back a sense of moral decency to the Whitehouse, says what he means and means what he says. That is a good thing although the far left don't like it.
No president in the history of the United States has had to deal with the adversity he has had to face. I shutter to think what would have happened if 911 or Katrina had happened under "Sweet Wily's" watch.
Thank you for being the best governor this state has ever had. I hope you run for president in my lifetime.

The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush
Capitol
Tallahassee, FL 32399

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to you to see if you can help me with my husband, David Seitz.  If you recall, I was appointed by you to  the State Board of Nursing and had to resign this summer due to my husband's health problems.  

Since that time, David has had severe problems with his eyes due to a stroke, and just this past week has had a major stroke that has left him with paralysis on his right side.

We have tried to get disability for David, and have been turned down twice, and now it will have to be reviewed by a judge sometime within a year.  The stroke that he had last week has completely left him incapacited physically.  I have sought out a rehab place that will help him return to a better condition, and the least expensive place is $1000.00 a day.  David's insurance will not cover it.  With long term disability treatment, it will be an enormous expense for us.  I could lose everything that I have.  

I am asking you if there is anything that you could do to get the disability for him expedited to take financial pressure off of our family.  Anything that you could do would be of great appreciation to myself and David.

Please let me hear from you as soon as possible.  You can contact me by phone at (863) 214-5943.  

Awaiting your reply, I remain

Sincerely yours

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing with the hope that you can get a message through to the President.  On his new conferences he refers to our men and women in the Armed Forces receiving all the help they need.  I want him to be aware of a situation that I have just learned of.  This past August my son (37 years old) felt that his Country needed him.  He resigned from his job of 10 years (working in a factory) and enlisted in the Army.  He has now completed his training and is so proud to be serving his County.  We are also very proud of him.  I was, however, shocked when he was in basic to learn that soap was not provided for their showers.  He was lucky as our family rallied around him sending all he needed.  These items were quickly stolen by those who were unable to get things sent to them by family.  I understand that a number of personal items should be supplied by the soldier, but please - even soap?  These are the young men and women training to protect our Country!  This is not the main reason for my letter, but the following is.  Upon completion of his training, he was allowed to have some time off and he went home.  Yesterday he was visiting with the friends of a childhood companion.  His friend is a Capt. in the Army and has served 2 tours in Afghanistan and 1 in Iraq.  While serving all 3 tours, they said there were so many necessary items that were not provided our soldiers.  They told my son that they had to send power saws, nails, space heaters, etc.  They have offered to do the same for my son as we will also.  These items will be shared with the entire unit, but I am angry as a tax payer to learn that needed items are not supplied.  I voted for President Bush.  I believe in President Bush and I do not feel he can be aware of this basic of needs being denied our soldiers.  
Thanks you for your time and MERRY CHRISTMAS!  Sincerely,  Lynn

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
 
        My wife and I are both US citizens. I am a state certified teacher with a Master's degree from FAU with multiple content area coverages ( Math, ESE, Computer Science, and Ed. Leadership) . I am currently employed by the School Board of Broward County as a Math teacher for over  7 years. My wife is a Registered Nurse and she is employed by Jackson Public Healthcare System for over 3 years.
 
        Attached you will find the invitation letter that I have sent for my aunt, but she was denied a tourist visas. I have also sent, along with the letter, all the necessary notarized documents to prove and support everything that my wife and I have worked very hard to achieve, which has included notarized copy of documents about our professional lives, our financial assets, and our credentials.  
 
        Upon the approval a tourist visas, I would be willing to put up any collateral as a bond to secure and guarantee her return to Haiti.  Let me assure you, Mr. Governor,  that If her visas was granted, she did not and would not have any intention to stay in the US, nor I would let her do so because I have too much respect for the law.
 
        I would appreciate any assistance to make the wish of my children come true for the holiday. Mr. Albert C. Jones, your recently appointed school board member, personally and professionally knows me. He should be able to talk to you about my character reference if you choose to approach him.
 
        My best wishes to you and your family for the Holiday Season and my anticipated thanks for your help in this matter!
 
May God bless the state of Florida, you, and our incoming governor, Mr. Charlie Christ!

I am sending this to you because I heard on Fox that you read your emails.  I am sure your brother doesn't and I doubt seriously if he is even given feedback by his staff so maybe you could pass on a word or two over the holidays.
 
 Here is the note:
 
Could you pardon the border agents like you did the drug dealer in Iowa?  Do you know what meth has done to the state of Iowa...and  alot of meth  now comes from Mexico. "Forgive those that trespass against us" must apply only to drug dealers since the one that was involved with the border agents was also forgiven. 
 
 What has happened to this country????  I am so disheartened for the life that awaits my grandchildren as we see our country disintegrate right before our very eyes.  I am very disappointed in your administration's inability to confront the border problem and what it is doing to our society.  And I know full good and well that you will never see this nor will you care.  Maybe that's why the Republicans took a beating in the elections.  What goes around comes around.  I am saddened.

Today I take my Bush 04 sticker off our vehicles and mourn the loss of our Countries greatness. Two border patrol agents are sentenced to prison for shooting a illegal criminal in the buttocks. They thought they had seen a gun, but could not swear it was a gun. It was stated that they could not chase this suspect; it is against border patrol policy.

President Bush has pardoned, but will not pardon these 2 “heroes”, who risked life and limb every day protecting our border. An illegal felon can bring charges against thes 2 American heroes, and Win.

I have NEVER missed a vote, and I have supported the Republican Party and their war on terrorism. Where is my party now, when 2 heroes need them, and in the home state of our president?

Our country has given more rights to illegal felons, then to our citizens and especially those protecting our border. I AM SO DISGUSTED THAT I AM SCREAMIMG MAD. I hope Democrats fill congress, win the Presidency as they surely can not throw 2 innocent men under the bus any worse than these 2 men have been.

This injustice sickens me, I will not vote for anybody who does not publicly stand against this injustice. I will vote for whoever does Republican, Democrat, or Independent.

America was the home of the brave and free, now the home of the illegal alien/felons home.

Heartsick and resolute,

I hate that you will be leaving office soon, I am a state employee and many 
of the changes that have come about while you have been in office have been 
beneficial to my clients and myself.

I, however, have had a problem with the us postal service.  I used their 
website to complain about the postmaster of the Sorrento (32776) post 
office.  When they  received my complaint, they referred it to the .....(get 
this).....postmaster of the Sorrento post office to handle.  I think you can 
understand why I am annoyed.  The man treated me with disdain, spoke to me 
like I was an idiot and exhibited zero customer service skills.  And now 
that I have complained, he has been assigned to handle my complaint.  I am 
sure he finds this quite funny.  I find it inappropriate.  I would never 
treat a client like I was treated, and if someone felt the need to complain 
about me, it would go to my supervisor to handle, not to me.

I am quite disgusted.

Dear Governor Bush,
    
      Doris M. Sanchez (on the left in the picture) has been a member of our Dental Team for just shy of 2 years.  She is an immigrant from Columbia.  She has a work permit and a Social Security number.  Her greatest desire in life is to receive her Green Card. She had been in pursuit of the dream for many years. Her English is impeccable, and she is teaching us phrases of Spanish on a daily basis.
    Last month she received an invitation for an "interview" by the Immigration Office in Tampa.  We were all thrilled for her as she felt that she was getting one step closer to her dream.  It was with heartfelt excitement that we all wished her well for her interview and celebrated the moment .
     When she arrived for her "Interview" she was informed that she had missed a court appearance, and was immediately arrested. She NEVER received any notice of this mystery court appearance. She  is being held in  the Pompano Beach detention center.  Her family is in the process of selling many of their possessions to try to afford to help her. (Including their car)
     Doris is a full time employee for us, and attends Edison Community College Full time at the night. She is studying Pre-Dental to hopefully apply to Dental School when she is able.  This young lady is brilliant and will achieve her goals if she is given the chance to. 
     Immigration has done us all a disservice. She is no threat to our county, and is the type of immigrant that our country was built on.  I beg of you to  PLEASE help her. 
   Her information is:   Doris Mercedes Sanchez
