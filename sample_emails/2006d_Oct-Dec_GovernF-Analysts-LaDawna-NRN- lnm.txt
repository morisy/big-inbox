My name is Ronald W. Smith.  I have been for 20 years the owner ,operator of a small charter boat for fishing and sightseeing in the Cape Coral area.
 
In March I started the process of renewing my Coast Guard License and have not yet received it. Nine months seems like an awful long time to wait for a license renewal.
 
For six months I have been out of business and unemployed.  Please help cut through the Government red tape and avoid any more delay so I can return to work.

Please get after George to pardon  the two border guards who have been arrested. He is ruining the Bush name. We are so disappointed with his concern about illegal entry into the US we have taken our name off of the Republican party and are now Independents. Maybe he'll listen to family. Sincerely.

Dear Mr. Bush,
    please help secure a Presidential pardon for Messrs. Compeon and Ramos.  They should not have to go to jail over Christmas for doing their job.  We need agents like them who are willing to risk their lives to protect Americans.  In fact, we need them here in Florida as we are sick and tired of the illegals and how they flagrantly violate our laws.  
 
    My family and I had to wait 9 years in Argentina before being granted a visa to immigrate to the USA. We didn't sneak in because we are law abiding people. 
 
    We are tired of the lawlessness and violence.  Yes, Florida has become a Banana Republic!  That is why we left Buenos Aires in the first place.  We were tired of the corruption.  Florida is no better than the country we left.  In fact, we are leaving here to find a more civilized place again, for certain decent people refuse to live with high crime. Our streets are no longer safe.  
 
    Your brother is right in using a heavy hand, that is why my family voted for him twice, because overseas Americans are thought of as weak and stupid.  Please call him and ask him to not punish these two men who were defending us.  Punish the drug pushers. Send them a message that we will not tolerate the crime they bring to our neighborhoods.
 Respectfully submitted,
Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
This morning on Longboat Key twenty-five (25) Cubans came ashore in the early morning hours.  I know you are aware of the landing.  My question to you is: Where are the Home Land Security people that are suppose to be watching our shores?  These people could have been our enemy from the Mid East with an intent to due harm to Mc Dill Air Base and Central Command Facilities.  They could have motored into Tampa Bay for all that matters and landed on the shore of Mc Dill.
 
I thought the U.S. Coast Guard was incharge of this task, but I bet ships were tied up at dockside in St.Petersburg Basin.  There are so many ships that are tied up that could be patroling our coast.  If the Coast Guard doesn't have enough ships, put some Navy ships on patrol form our Florida Navy Bases.  This was a serious breach of our shoreline this morning and no one is asking, "Where were the patrol boats"?
 
I know you have a short time left in office, but this breach of security should be placed on the top of your stack of work.  Thanks for listening to a frustrated citizen.

Dear Mr Bush

My husband and I were on L1 and L2 Visas respectively whilst residing in
Florida.

We are now living back in the UK having set up our internet bulb company in
the USA.  We have been in business since 1860  and supply many members of
the British Aristocracy, not to mention supplying historic houses etc. in
the UK.

Whilst being treated at Celebration Hospital over three and a half years ago
my wife was subjected to extreme cruelty.  I contacted Pat Hall and also
engaged the well respected firm of Bogin, Munns and Munns to deal with this
matter.

Too date this matter has not been resolved, although we now live in the UK,
as Bogin, Munns and Munns decided to drop the case.

My wife, Naomi Blom suffers from panic attacks and was on the drug Xanax, at
the time she took 10 X 2mg of these tablets, she was extremely anxious, as
her best friend in Malaysia had just died and on the same day discovered
from her mother in the UK that her father had cancer.  She panicked, after
taking these tablets and I immediately took her to ER at Celebration
Hospital ( at this conjesture, I must add that she had afull unopened bottle
of 100 X 2mg of this drug, so, obviously her intention was not to kill
herself).  We have three boys whom we both love dearly.

I am sending you these photographs of her hand, where an orderly grabbed her
whilst I was out of the hospital trying to reach the British Embassy,  the
incident with the ordrly left her hand disfigured, not to mention the severe
PTSD she still suffers.  I thought that you should be aware of this incident
as it happened in your State.  Pat Hall has always been and continues to be
most supportive of both myself and my wife.

Whilst writing, I must congratulate you on the high standards of education
in Osceola County, our children flourished whilst they were there, in
particular my eldest son Chris, who took part in band and had the
opportunity to play at Disneyworld.  He is now studying A Levels here and
hopes to be able to attend medical School in New York.
The hospitality we received from your fellow citizens was fantastic and we
were very sorry to have to leave when business brought us back to the UK.

By nature, we are Conservative and therefore Republicans.
Your brother, The President is doing a fantastic job, it's a pity that more
world leaders do not have his strength and absolute resolve.

I am sorry that I have had to contact you with regard to this, however would
not like this sort of incident to occur to anyone else.

Yours most sincerely

I realize you are leaving offiice but I wanted to send you a concern of mine.
Upon arriving in Miami last week I was faced with a dilema that our state has allowed. I need assistance and use a wheelchair. I am stuck so to speak. I quickly realized that the person assisting me could not speak a work of English. I arrived to my home country and am literally not able to communicate with the staff. Two people she stopped to chat with could not communicate either. I was late for a connection and was very worried. 
 I am not going to bore you with the rest of the details but why has this been allowed? A person working with the public must be able to speak the language of the country. I was saddened and angered. Is anything being done to correct this, or is it just going to get worse?

PLEASE

THIS IS SOMETHING I AM NOT TAKING LIGHTLY.  IF THIS MAN PASSES (DIES) 
WITHOUT HIS DUE HONORS - IT SHALL BE COME MY LIFES PATH TO FOLLOW, NO MATTER 
THE STRUGGLES, BRING ATTENTION TO THIS FORGOTTEN ISSUE. NO MATTER HOW HIGH, 
NO MATTER WHOM I WILL REACH AND CONTINUE UP THE LINE, BRINING IT TO OUR 
GOVERNMENT, SENATES, LOCAL OFFICALS, AS HIGH AS IT MUST GO - TO SPEAK FOR 
THE ONES NOW TO OLD (IF NOT ALREADY PASSED ON) TO RECIEVE THIS SIMPLE 
REQUEST.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE ARE TODAY WHAT THESE MEN FOUGHT FOR - 
AMERICA.

I was told about this A WW11 veteran named Roy Robinson, by another veteran. 
The other veteran told me of the severe torture Mr.Robinson endured while 
serving the freedom and good of his country. I asked to met Mr.Robinson.

During my encounter with Mr. Robinson, just to shake his hand. He not once, 
spoke of his war time afflictions. But this when I saw the saddness and hurt 
in this mans eyes. I found out the listed below reason for this:

He mentioned one thing trying to get his medals. He'd contacted a couple of 
veteran facilities in order that he could receive his (in my words - DUE 
ACCOMMODATIONS) medals.

Mr. Roy Robinson is a sickly man. Yet he sits at a tiny flea market, in the 
cold selling bits and pieces. I do believe Mr. Robinson's days are few.

I  AM VERY ANGER:  This man - has not received, nor heard any response 
regarding: possibly the only meaningful thing in his life.

These medals made of something simple, maybe tin - But could be what enables 
him to on knowing what he stands for and believes in - America.

My words: without the men, long ago, fighting for our country, is what has 
enabled us to be were we are today!?!

In Mr. Robinsons finally days, could it not be so simple as to 
complete/grant this request!?! To give him his finally happiness!

Saddness this fills my heart.

I sent this information to you on December 6th and have heard no reply. I 
even requested where to be directed!

ROY L ROBINSON:  34-541-897;  4129TH QUARTERMASTER SERVICE COMPANY, HONRABLE 
DISCHARGE, 25 NOVEMBER 25, 1945.
BORN 12 FEB 1922.
SERVED IN WW11.

If it is that the medals must be PURCHASED, which is outlandish - I will 
from my personal social sercuity check due the honors of paying for them.

SINCERELY, REGRATEFULLY,

Gov Bush i know you will wonder why i am appealing to you for help being i am in NC.  I am getting no help here and i am appealing to you to forward a message to the President.  I have sent several emails to the White House and many other agents and not getting the help i need.  I am a republican and not getting any help from my republican people.  The problem is that nothing gets to the senators nor the congressman.  They are halted at the local offices and get no futher.  Let me say before i explain my problem is i am a retired minister also.  I spent 28 years in the Christian Ministry and never lied about anything to get what i wanted and i am not starting now.
My wife is from Australia.  We had known each other for almost 4 years.  She wanted me to come to Australia but we knew i could not become a citizen there because of my health problems.  So she decided to come and visit me.  After she had been here about 2 weeks i knew how much i loved her and she felt the same way.  I did not want her to go back and she did not want to.  I am on disability and did not have the money for all that.  We also knew it could take her another year to get back here with all she had to do.  At that time i called Senator Elizabeth Dole's office and asked if there was any way she could stay here and be legal.  They called me back and said if we got married in 90 days she could stay and be here legal.  We were also told she would be on a 2 year probation before she could get a green card and a ss card.  That was fine with us at least we would be together.  Her 2 years is up now and i called INS and asked for the papers to fill out for her green card.  In the meantime while we were waiting for the paper work her daughter called and asked her if there was any way she could come back to Au and be a part of her wedding.  Every mother wants to be with her daughter during this important time of her life.  I told my wife i had to do some calling and find out.  I called the INS and told them all she had was her Au passport and a copy of our wedding cerificate and wanted to know was there any way she could go and get back here ok.  I also explained that she did not have her green card but we were waiting for the papers to file for it.  The agents response was even if you had the papers in hand right now you could not get them done and approved before she wanted to go, but she will be ok.  I asked again and said are you sure and he said yes.  So iput my wife on a plane after the tickets got here that her daughter paid for and sent her to Australia.  When she got ready to come home she presented her passport and her marriage cerificate and the airport in Brisbane.  The lady at the airport said they had no problems sending her home but she needed to call LA Homeland Security to make sure she would be ok.  The agent there refused to let her board the plane.  The Au lady asked why, she has her marriage cerificate showing she is married to an American Citizen and been married for 2 years.  They still refused.  The authorities at Brisbane callled me and told me what was going on and asked if i would call LA and explained to them what the INS told me.  I said yes i would.  She gave me the number and i called.  I told the agent who i was and gave him my wives name and tried to explain to him what the INS told me.  I could not get 4 words out before he would interupt me and say, "Your eife not come home here, your wife not board the plane."  Yes i ahd a foreign person in charge of the HLS.  Everytime i tried again to explain, i got the same answer.  He was very rude and nasty to me.
I spent frm sunday night till wednesday night sending emails and making phone calls on the state level and to Washington to try and get this solved.  No one would do anything because i did not get the agents name.  When i got the State Dept they said it was HLS issue.  HLS would say it is a State Dept issue, and on and on one group puts it on another group.  When i called Senator Dole's office they changed everything they had told me before.  There was a new lady there and was not the one there when my wife first got here.  I know it was another cover up to protect the lie and the misleading given to me by INS.  Senator Burr's office is the only that has given me any help at all.  They told me to do a I-130 form and she could get home.  But it will take 6-8 months to get her back.  Now i know that Senator Dole did not see any of my emails or i might have gotten more help.  
Sir my wife and i should not have to wait 6-8 months to be back together because of a mistake made by INS.  I am 66 years old and not in good health.  I am a bad diabetic and recently had a heart attack.  I have been back in the hospital 4 times with heart problems since i had the heart attack.  
All i am asking is for someone to admit a mistake was made and get my wife back home.
I hope you will let Governor Bush see this email and maybe he can get it to the President or the Vice President and get me some help.  There is no need to send it to INS because i ahve talked to them many times.  I talked to a Dr. White in DC and she said she was going to pull all the tapes around that day to the number i called and have them listened too.  Sir do you think that is going to happen?  I don't.  Even if they do they will never admit it.
Sir i just want my wife back.  I need her.  I miss her and i love her.  Right now she is very upset and so am I.  I cannot believe my govt has turned their back on an American citizen and will give no help.
I told someone the other day i taught govt and us history in high school working my way through college and seminary.  Right now if i was teaching govt i could not use the text book about my govt and my govt officials.  I would ahve to write my own text book.
Please, i beg you, whoever gets this email, please let Gov Bush read it.  Please help me get my wife back.

SS Benefits 
Instructions are at the end. 
Subject: Social Security 
My mom was a homemaker and dad worked all his life and paid into Social Security, dad has passed away and now my mom can barely make ends meet.  While the possibly "illegal" alien in front of her at the grocery store buys the name brands, my mom goes for the generic brands, and day old breads. 
She doesn't have out of state calling on her phone, because she can't afford it and shops at the thrift shops and dollar stores while the "illegal" aliens go to Macy's, Gap, J.C. Penny, Banana Republic, etc. 
She considers having a pizza delivered once a week "eating out".  She grew up during the depression, watched her husband go overseas to fight in WW II a year after their marriage, and then they went on to raise, feed and clothe 5 children, scrounging to pay tuition for parochial schools. 
I'm sorry, but I can't see how the Senate can justify this slap in the face to born and bred, or naturalized citizens.  It is already impossible to live on Social Security alone.  If they  give benefits to "illegal" aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave us that have paid into Social Security all our working lives? 
The Senate voted this week to allow "illegal" aliens access to Social Security benefits.  Attached is an opportunity to sign a petition that requires citizenship for eligibility to receive Social services.  If  you do not wish to sign the petition yourself, please forward on to anyone you think might be interested. 
PETITION FOR: President Bush Dear Mr. President; The petition below is a protest against the recent vote of the senate which was to allow illegal aliens access to our social security!  We demand that you and all congressional representatives require complete, permanent citizenship for anyone to be eligible for Social Security and social services in the  United States.

Thank you for responding, but I think/believe, based on the information we have been given recently – that we are taking in 1million+ immigrants per year –somebody better check on what it means to our kids & grandkids –do the future numbers & things don’t look to good for any of us….or the immigrants.   I do believe we could help their country be a better place then they would not feel they must leave their home –that’s got to be hard for them & I now the friends I have that have come from other countries do wish they didn’t have a country that was so hard to live in –they would have liked to stay in their own country with their families there.

Thank you for sharing your views about proposed changes to United States immigration policies.  Governor Bush appreciates your concerns and asked me to respond on his behalf.

 

Governor Bush believes it is important to secure and protect our borders rather than create provisions that are punitive to those immigrants who make a unique and important contribution to our country.  Protecting safe, open, and legal immigration for those who come to America creates a more prosperous United States of America.

 

Because this issue is so important to the security and continued success of our country, it deserves a fair, transparent hearing in Washington.  Please rest assured Governor Bush understands your concerns and is confident that resolving this critical issue is a positive challenge facing our country rather than a negative one.  The Governor will remember your concerns when speaking with and federal officials.

 

Thank you again for writing.

I and other Americans/Floridians I work with and in my neighborhood are getting very worried & concerned about all the immigrants.  We all agree we like to help people but what about ‘our own’?

I just learned that California must build 1 new school each day to keep up with their growth due to people coming in from other countries – mainly Mexico.  This is really not good for America.  What can Floridians do to help the situation?  Please advise on what I can pass on to neighbors, co-workers & business owners in the area who are worried & concerned about the immigration situation.

Thank you for any help & advice you can give.

If this doesn't open your eyes... nothing will! 
 
From the L.A. Times 
1. 40% of all workers in L.A. County ( L.A. County has 10.2 million people) 
are working for cash and not paying taxes. This was because they are 
predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. 
2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens. 
3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens. 
4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien 
Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers. 
5. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers 
are Mexican nationals here illegally. 
6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages. 
7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles 
are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border. 
8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal. 
9. 21 radio stations in L.A. are Spanish speaking. 
10. In L.A. County 5.1 million people speak English. 
3.9 million speak Spanish. 
(There are 10.2 million people in L.A. County). 
(All the above from the Los Angeles Times) 
Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, 
but 29% are on welfare. 
Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth 
 (and over 90% of California , Florida , and New York ) 
results from immigration. 
The cost of immigration to the American taxpayer in 1997 was,
 (after subtracting taxes immigrants pay), a NET $70 BILLION/ 
year, [Professor Donald Huddle, Rice University ]. The lifetime 
fiscal impact (taxes paid minus services used) for the average 
adult Mexican immigrant is a NEGATIVE number. 
29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens. 
If they can come to this country to raise Hell and demonstrate by 
the thousands, WHY can't they take charge over the corruption 
in their own country? 
We are a bunch of fools for letting this continue. 
THE U.S. VS  MEXICO 
 
On February 15, 1998, the U.S. and Mexican soccer teams met at the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. The crowd was overwhelmingly pro-Mexican even though most lived 
in this country. They booed during the National Anthem and U.S. flags were held 
upside down. As the match progressed, supporters of the U.S. team were insulted, 
pelted with projectiles, punched and spat upon. Beer and trash were thrown at 
the U.S. players before and after the match. The coach of the U.S. team, Steve 
Sampson said, "This was the most painful experience I have ever had in this 
profession." 
Did you know that immigrants from Mexico and other non-European countries 
can come to this country and get preferences in jobs, education, and government 
contracts. It's called affirmative action or racial privilege. The Emperor of Japan 
or the President of Mexico could migrate here and immediately be eligible for 
special rights unavailable for Americans of European descent. 
Corporate America has signed on to the idea that minorities and third world 
immigrants should get special, privileged status. Some examples are Exxon, 
Texaco, Merrill Lynch, Boeing, Paine Weber, Starbucks and many more. 
DID YOU KNOW? 
Did you know .. that Mexico regularly intercedes on the side 
of the defense in criminal cases involving Mexican nationals? 
Did you know .. that Mexico has NEVER extradited a Mexican 
national accused of murder in the U.S. in spite of agreements to do so? 
According to the L.A. Times, Orange County , California is home to 275 
gangs with 17,000 members, 98% of which are Mexican and Asian. 
How's your county doing? 
According to a New York Times article dated May 19, 1994, 20 years after 
the great influx of legal immigrants from Southeast Asia, 30% are still on 
welfare compared to 8% of households nationwide. A Wall Street Journal 
editorial dated December 5, 1994 quotes law enforcement officials as stating that Asian mobsters are the "greatest criminal challenge the country 
faces." Not bad for a group that is still under 5% of the population. 
Is education important to you? Here are the words of a teacher who spent 
over 20 years in the Los Angeles School system. "Imagine teachers in classes 
containing 30-40 students of widely varying attention spans and motivation, 
many of whom aren't fluent in English. Educators seek learning materials 
likely to reach the majority of students and that means fewer words and 
math problems and more pictures and multicultural references." 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG 
I remember hearing about the immigrants that came through Ellis Island . 
They wanted to learn English. They wanted to breathe free. They wanted 
to become Americans.   Now, far too many immigrants come here with de- 
mands. They demand to be taught in their own language. They demand spe- 
cial privileges ... affirmative action. They demand ethnic studies that glorify 
their culture. 
NOW .. 
WHY CAN'T WE SEND THEM HOME

 Governor Bush:

As part of Congress.org's virtual hearing on immigration reform, I want to 
share my views on this important issue.  I support focussing on border 
security first. No to amnesty, No to citizenship to criminals.  NO to 
guest worker programs that don't work. Find all of the people our 
government lost first. People are paying up to $60,000 to get into the usa 
illegally, and politicians worry that a $300 fee to take a test is too 
much, come on. No politician objected that iIhad to go without healthcare 
for year until my medicare kicked in, and iIhad just had a heart attack. 
We need to enforce our employment laws, no one should profit from a crime.

Subject:	Re: letter from concerned citizen directed to ICE

I really appreciate your response. It meant a lot to know somone cared enough to respond, sometimes I feel like I'm all alone dealing with this whole mess, on top of it being a full time student.
I understand the lack of jurisdiction in this case however my question is that my fiance, Emmanuel and I were supposed to be married before this all happened and we would like to still be married. I have hired a lawyer but he tells me we have to gain permission to be married. I understand, however if Emmanuel is married to a U.S citizen he would become a U.S. citizen and thus legal in this country. I wrote a letter actually to ICE about our relationship and how they were taking the love of my life, my biggest supporter away from me when I need him the most. Is there anything you know of that could be done to have us married and go on with our lives?
 
My other question is about my fiance's brother, Frederich, who has a different case. He has been a full time student except for this last past semester. Frederich's girlfriend and I have been working together, yet have been utterly astonished as to this point as to the extent of ambiguity in responses we have been receiving from governement officials. First we hear that Frederich was being held by INS, then we heard that the state had a hold on him, then we hear the federal court doesnt know what to do with his case. What has complicated Frederich's case and has proven to be a major problem was that he was convicted, a black man, by an all white jury in Gainesville, Florida. Now I am studying criminal justice in school and have learned that juries are supposed to be a whole representation of the community and if they are not, they then can be challenged. The law enforcement officer was the only one who said he was pushed by Frederich, the other two witnesses said Frederich did nothing. However he was convicted off the basis of one police officer's statement and an all white jury, which if I may say, doesn't sound like justice. We are trying to get the case appealed, however in the mean time the state will not reinstate his bond and insist on keeping him illegally confined in jail until his sentencing date. We still to this day do not know why Frederich was detained, and in my opinion that is a pretty big deal to incarcerate someone for no reason.
 
 
Thank you again so much again for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: letter from concerned citizen directed to ICE


Hello, 
If you could please take the time to read this I would really appreciate it. It is about my fiance who was picked up by ICE and my encounters with the rude and unprofessional governement officials that I think you should be aware of. Thank you so much.

To Whom It May Concern:

It is unfortunate that tonight as I, a hardworking and responsible college student sit to begin my research for an upcoming paper, am overwhelmed with concern and sadness. I sit distraught, as I have for the last three weeks, wondering if I will ever feel any better, wondering if I will ever get answers. You see, around three weeks ago, my fiancé and his brother were picked up by ICE at their very own apartment and taken to a local county jail. Ever since then my encounters with ICE have been very dissatisfying, disheartening, and frustrating to say the least. I feel that it is my duty as an American woman, a fiancé, and a friend, to draw your attention today to such a serious and growing problem. Not only am I concerned for my own well being, but for others who may possibly be experiencing similar incidents, who may not have the capability nor knowledge to speak out.
In my opinion, dealing with immigration is very complicated as I'm sure you would agree. However, what amazes me is that when you deal with immigration cases, you take custody over people who have developed lives for themselves, grown as human beings, just as you and I have in this world; have families, relationships, foundations, standards of living. So when you take away one character in the scene of life, you have everything and everyone else remaining, but with a void. Everyone surrounding feel the effects. Now granted I am a firm believer in paying for your mistakes, don't get me wrong, however, my point is that people who are in charge of immigration (transportation, deportation, investigations: ICE) need to be more weary of this fact that concerned family members will be inquiring often. Make our time when dealing with such a devastating period a little easier by just being helpful professionals as you so call yourselves. 
I cannot begin to tell you how unprofessional and rude some of the people I have spoken to who have worked for ICE have been. Today even I spoke to an officer at Nassau County Jail who was very helpful and polite. He agreed when I jokingly said "I really appreciate how respectful and helpful you have been today, what a coincidence you must not work for ICE since you are being so nice today." I even spoke to someone at The Department of Homeland Security who agreed as well that ICE officials were known to not be helpful and possibly be rude. Why would you want to have a reputation as such? I only wish I had taken down those names of ICE employees I encountered, however I've been so frustrated and on the telephone so much over the last three weeks, that I most likely would not have had enough paper to write everything down on. It is sad that I have almost memorized the recording on Krome Processing Center's menu about how they intend to adhere to us, the public in a "prompt, courteous, and professional manner". I've never laughed so hard in disbelief, for it was even a miracle to have someone answer the phone at Krome. But that's sad, very sad. 
Why should it be so difficult to find where my fiancé's property went after he was detained? Why when I call ICE who supposedly are in possession of his belongings can I not get an officer to call me back or answer the phone or for that matter even transfer me to the right person? Why can I not check up on his account to make sure the money I have been sending him has been received? I am a family member trying to find out information so I can get in contact with a loved one! How would you feel if you haven't spoken to your loved one in over two weeks? How would you feel if they were in a completely different state alone and you didn't know how they were doing? My point it is completely unnecessary for me to have been treated the way I have been for the last few weeks. There is no excuse what so ever. I was going back and forth today all afternoon, transferred from one place to another, given thousands of telephone numbers, different names, only to get in the end a bunch of generic recorded menus, no returned phone calls, and thus inevitably a dead telephone battery. It just seems like a reoccurring problem, that no one (most at ICE) has any clue as of what is going on around them, nor care to help you find a solution. I was taught at the age of seventeen even at a part time job in the mall that you always have to come up with a solution. We were always taught that there was an alternate solution so one would say to the customer, "such and such might not work, BUT THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU…" I was taught that was your job as a professional. If part time employees at a mall can get this down then why can't federal government officials? Take pride in your work and do it well. Being who you are you take on a major role in how our country runs, and as a citizen I am very disappointed the way you serve as a  representation of America. 
Something needs to be done to fix this problem. I have never been a selfish person, never ask for much in life, but this struck a nerve and I would hope after reading this letter something be done. I am not happy, not happy at all, that this place I call my home, my beloved country would employ government officials who would ever treat anyone like they have. 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Thank you for the reply. The reason I why I addressed this concern to Mr Bush, was that a few days ago I read an orbituary article about a WWI veteran who also was a navy corpsman and apparently no medals were ever issued to him. It mentioned that at a brief ceremony, Governor Bush presented him with the medal for his service to this country. Hopefully with the information given, I should be able to go to the right source.

Good morning Sir:
Would like to ask you a small questio as perhaps you could direct me to the right department. I had been working for a disable person for the last six years. He had proudly served as a navy corpsman during WORLD WAR II aboard the battleship USS IOWA in the pacific and atlantic theater. My question to you is: What can I do or whom should I contact for him to be given the medals of his service for his country? Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

LaDawna,

 

I have attached last year’s welcome letter from Gov Bush for your reference. We are requesting an updated letter for our 2007 Palm Beach Jewelry & Antique Show catalogue. This year it will be an impressive hard cover book.  

 

For purposes of updating the letter, this is the 4th annual Palm Beach Jewelry & Antique Show taking place every year over Presidents’ Day Weekend (Feb 16 – 20, 2007) at the Palm Beach County Convention Center. I have taken the liberty of a draft letter that may be of some help as time is of the essence. We would appreciate a final letter by next Monday, Oct 30th.

 

Thank you so much for your prompt attention to this request. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Dear Governor, Jeb Bush,
 
Warm greetings to you and your staff, and thank you for receiving my email message. I want to let you know how much I appreciate the phenominal work you have done for this state over the past years. This is the first time I have ever attempted to contact you, therefore I apologize if I am not following proper lines of communication. 
 
I currently have the privilege to work for the Transportation Security Administration at the Orlando airport and appreciate the important role we have in the security of our passengers and the safety of the traveling community. However, as you may or may not know, there is very little (if any) positive press about our organization and I would like to make a small contribution towards changing this image with your assistance and advice. 
 
As a result of the current restrictions on liquids due to the elevated security level, I estimate that we throw away or recycle hundreds of pounds of plastic every day.
I understand that there are companies that construct playgrounds out of recycled plastics and would like to inquire what government programs and/or grants I may be able to utilize so that our organization may give back to local communities by providing playgrounds out of the tons of plastics we discard every week. 
 
As an organization that is frequently in the media spotlight, I feel that we have the means to demonstrate and exemplify a sense of environmental ethics while adding value to local communities in addition our main objective to protect the traveling public from potential threats. I would greatly appreciate your assistance with this tremendous endeavor. Again, thank you for receiving my email and I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Kind Regards,
Luis Aponte

Dear Governor Bush
 
Thank you very much for they reply sent by your aid LD McDonald.  I realize how may peices of mail you must get everyday and even for your aid to reply is appreciated.
 
I realize that "immigration" issues are for the most part overseen by the federal government, this I fully understand.  I also appreciate your referral to the Honorable Mel Martinez and the Honorable Bill Nelson.  I will, as you advise, contact both of these individuals.
 
Your aid in her e-mail stated "the Governor wishes he could be of more assistance, please know this is due to lack of jurisdiction and not lack of concern".  This I believe and it is appreciated.  Though the overall immigration issue is a Federal issue, in this particular case the immediate concern is with Catherine's drivers license, a state issue and hopefully one where you can intervein.  Here I hope that you will be able to offer some assistance.  
 
I won't ramble on or take up more of your time, I know it's limited.  I'll just close by saying, It's just one individual, one who cannot even vote.  This however doesn't make her less of a person or her individual situation less of a concern.  She is a 50 year old lady, one of the nicest that I've had the pleasure of knowing.  She is caught up in a situation for which there seems to be no solution.  She is a home owner, pays her property taxes, has excellent credit, speaks perfect English, and would do anything to help anyone.  I hope you can be of some help to her.  All she needs at this time is to be able to drive so that she can earn a liveing, go to the Doctors and buy groceries.  She owns her car, has full insurance and is a threat to no one.  
 
She is "very" proud of America, we should be proud of her also and help if there is a way.
 
I wish for you, your family and your staff a Happy and Safe Thanksgiving.
 
For reference, in case needed, I re-attached my original letter.
 
Best Regards

Subject:	IMMIGRATION AND INSURANCE ISSUE

Dear Governor Bush. 

I am extremely disappointed and irritated in the way that my situation is being handled…Here's a brief synopsis. 

On 6 September 06, while my daughter was in college, she was hit by a gentlemen who left the scene of the accident because he did not speak English.  I have contacted the Chief of Police in Maitland Florida where the accident occurred and cannot get a correct answer out of them.  Luckily, my daughter was not hurt, however, her brand new 06 truck was.  I had to initiate a Florida Department of Insurance investigation to even determine if this person has insurance.  It turns out he is an illegal immigrant..who according to the Department of Insurance is on a list to be deported.  I was furious when I found this out.  The Department of Insurance said it did not fall within the scope of their department.  I then contacted the Department of Immigration and the State Attorney's Office and was told by both offices.."unless he has committed a felony, we don't care".

After several months, I found out the owner of the vehicle did have insurance.  I have contacted his insurance company, which has been about 2 months ago.  I have heard nothing.  When I once again called the Department of Insurance to make a complaint against the insurance company I was told "If the driver does not coorperate, we do not have to pay your claim!"  What?  What makes you think someone who never reported the accident to begin with..is going to cooperate?

There are several issues regarding this case that I want answers to and I feel that you are the only one who can give me the answers.

1.  Why is an illegal immigrant who is on a list to be deported even allowed to get a Driver's License in the State of Florida.  If I have a suspended license in another state, I certainly won't be able to get in the State of Florida…Why is a illegal able to get a Driver's License?

  
2.  According to the DMV..it is against the law to leave the scene of an accident.  Why was this man allowed to leave the scene of an accident.  How do we know he was not DUI?  What if my daughter had been seriously hurt and needed medical attention? Would she have possibly died because "he did not speak English?"  Isn't this preferential treatment?

3. Why when officials from your state have been notified that an illegal immigrant with a name, address, and driver's license number is on the list to be deported…no one wants to do it?

According to all the information I have received…an illegal immigrant who is on a list to be deported who probably does not pay taxes or have a contractor's license allowed to do this.  

I have given this country 23 years of my life.  Both my husband and  I -pay taxes and pay insurance.  However, an illegal immigrant who is not even supposed to be in this country has more rights than we do.  This is extremely sad and I'm embarrassed to call Florida my home.  Do what's right.

I am standing by right to present documentation and well as to clarify any information, should you need that. 

Very Respectfully,

Thanks for the reply.  I can't say I am surprised that you passed the buck, however I was hoping the respnse would have been different.  Obviously, "The Governor" never sees these e-mails.  I honestly believe (or certainly would like to believe) if he did, he might offer a different suggestion than to contact my state senators in Washington.  This is not a problem that can wait years to resolve.  My former husband will be without health insurance on December 9th and because of his disabilities cannot obtain private health insurance and because of some flaws with the Social Secuity and Medicare laws, he cannot get Medicare until July 2007.  Are you seriously telling me nothing can be done and we  have no assistance in the State of Florida to help with this?  He makes $1,350 per month from SSA disability and has an IRA with $7,000.00 in it.  How sad is it that such a small amount of assets prevents him from receiving any type of aid from a state in which he has lived for 50 years!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to you on behalf of my former husband, Philip Fiorentino, who finds himself in a difficult situation at this time regarding health insurance and needs your help.
 
Just so you understand, we were married for nearly 25 years, have been divorced for 3 1/2 and remain very good friends, so we try to help each other out whenever we can.  Insurance is my field of expertise to some degree, therefore I am trying to help him. 
 
In an attempt to keep this brief, Phil is currently on disability income as a result of several dibilitating conditions.  He was first approved for this in January 2005 and received his first state disability payment in July 2005.  Since we are a relatively normal, my (former) husband and I always had good jobs with excellent health insurance so we never had any problems in that area until now. 
 
In a nutshell, there are some serious flaws to the Medicare laws that relate to disability recipients.  If this has come to MY attention, I am sure you are aware of it, but Phil needs a solution now so I am contacting you for help.
 
After he was unable to continue working, we COBRA'd his health insurance from work.  Well, his COBRA runs out December 9, 2006.  I called to register him for Medicare, (after all, he is on disability, right???) only to find out he is not eligible for 2 years AFTER he began receiving his SSI payments, (which is 2 1/2 years from his approval date!)  I am floored! Clearly, this makes no sense.  If someone is on disability, obviously, he can't work and there are significant pre-existing conditions. If there are pre-existing conditions, no one wants to insure you, and if they do, the coverage is limited and the premiums are "through the roof", especially considering he is on a fixed income.  I made calls to several private health insurance carriers and even IF they are willing to cover him, the premiums are unaffordable.
 
The Social Security Office suggested applying for Medicaid, but already told me that his income is to high for assistance.  That also is ironic because if he has to pay what I have been quoted for health insurance, then his income qualifies him as poverty level.
 
I guess my question to you is: How can someone on disability not qualify for Medicare and what can be done to get him insured right away?  I have left 2 messages at the Medicaid office, but have not yet received a call back.  I currently live in Central Florida, but have plans to go to South Florida this weekend to help Phil sort this out. I took the day off work Friday so we can go to the Medicaid office , if necessary, but since I haven't heard back from them, I am not sure if this is a wasted trip.
 
If you need more information from me as to Phil's condition, or specific research I have done, I will be happy to provide that to you.  All I know is he cannot be without health insurance and if Medicare or Medicaid are not available to him because of flaws in state & federal laws, he and others like him should not be the ones to suffer and we need to know what to do.
 
Please help.
 
By the way, I mean this sincerely...it has been a pleasure and honor having you as this State's Governor.  A greatly admire you and your entire family and look forward to seeing you in the White House in the near future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Linda Fiorentino

Dear Gov. Bush,
This past weekend after being graciously asked to participate in the Veteran's Day Parade, I accepted for multiple reasons. One being the proximity of the parade, which was in "Inverness" which is so near to Bushnell National Cemetary, which is my husbands final resting place, and also because I am a "Navy Mom". My son is about to venture on his 4th deployment overseas since his enlistment in March of 1998. Yes I am a very proud Navy Mom.
Unfortunately I am also ashamed, that after I went to pay my respects to my late husband, who just so happens to be my "Navy Sons" dad, I am saddened to have discovered none of the grave sites bore a flag for this holiday, and I now have to share that information with my son, that what he is currently fighting for, our own country can not honor those who have fought in the past. My son enlisted, feeling proud to be a third generation "Navy Man". And right now while always so proud of my son, I am not feeling very proud of my government.
Besides that, I witnessed young women, kneeling on the ground over new graves with out markers yet, which demonstrates they are recent burial sites, and these poor widows, whose husbands gave the ultimate did not even see one sign of recognition for what they have given in the name of our country. I witnessed a man, actually laying on his sons grave, also as yet unmarked, weeping having given his only son, and he is keeping the grave warm with his body, as also there was no flag. Where is our patriotism? Do our tax dollars have to go to other countries to rebuild, to feed the poor, and yet we can not allocate a few dollars to show our gratitude and respect for our own dead a few times a year?
When my son leaves for his fourth deployment this January, I now know that if he does not arrive back to me intact, that once I am no longer here to honor and respect him, that neither will my State nor Country.
Oh how sad Gov. Bush, how very sad. The shame should be put upon our leaders, you can take our sons, daughters, husbands, wives, and yet you can not honor them with 12 cent flag. Shame on our administration on all levels.
Unlike former times, my son was not drafted, he volunteered to join and re enlisted because he believes in freedom and the need to protect his country at such a very delicate time in history, and what is his country showing for his honor?Ignoring the simple task of honoring the dead before him who have served.
Gov. Bush, I ask you, you still have time before you leave office, honor my son by honoring his father and grandfather and all the others before him, give them a flag, show them they are not forgotten.
thank you, 
Dale Helms

Governor Bush,
 
Let me start off by first saying that it is my pleasure to have this opportunity to write you this letter and hope that it does reach you.  My name is Belinda Dareus and I am a student at Hillsborough Community College.  Every time I turn on the TV and I hear talk of immigration I get very sensitive to the matter.  Me being of Haitian background, I don’t like to see immigrants being talked about as if we do not contribute to the population.  Just imagine yourself on one of the little boats or even a piece of a raft just trying to make it to the United States.  Have you ever asked yourself why we as humans would go though so much just to get here.  
 
            I can remember as a little girl hearing of stories of how people would walk for days just to try to get to the U.S. from Mexico and how people would be on a small crowded boat for days or even weeks at a time with little to no food.  Have you ever once stop to ask yourself, “Why is it that people would put themselves through all of this?”  Is it just so that they can say I made to the U.S. or come here and see how many jobs they could take from us, and I do mean us, native born Americans.  Or maybe they just want to test their survival rate at sea and they love to conduct this type of risky research.  NO.
 
            I will not say long I know that you are a very busy man and this not the first time you have heard talk of immigration and it will not be the last.  But for once put yourself in their shoes.  Think about your love ones you will have left behind; not to hurt them but to try to make a way to help them.  I leave you with this in hope that one day immigrants will to have a voice.
 
                                                                                    Respectfully Yours
                                                                                    Ms. Belinda Dareus

Thank you, and our dear Governor, for the reply. As I am e-mailing 
Representatives I am learning that one needs to contact only those on a 
federal level. I will be contacting the Senators you so kindly directed 
me to. It is such a shame that Governor Jeb Bush cannot run for another 
term, he has been an outstanding Governor and is a great, decent

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would like to start by saying how proud I am to live in Florida and to have you as the Governor.  I have been a Florida residence since 12/96.  I lived the rest of my life in Ohio where we could not count on our Governor or others in office.
 
It makes me very proud to say I live in Florida and I stand up for what you are doing and have done for this state.
 
The reason I am writing you is that as of April 2005 I have been unable to work due to my health.  My health still has not improved for me to return to work.  I have worked since I was 14 years old by example of my parents.  Thank God for my parents and the morals they instilled in me.  
 
I need your help, I filed for disability through Social Security April 2005.  I have been denied twice and had to hire an attorney.  I was recently told that it could be another 18 months before we have a hearing before the Judge.  My attorney said there is 3 judges who handle the cases and they can only do 40 a day.  We have to wait our turn that we are in a pile like all of the other 7500.  That many die before there case ever goes before the Judge.  
 
We can't afford to wait much longer.  Every month that goes by puts us deeper in the hole financially.  We never expected that I would not be able to return to work.  I have gone to every county agency to get assistance but was told that either my house payment was too high or my husband makes too much money.  Our church has helped as much as they could.  We are not one for gifts or charity but when your back is against the wall you do what you can.  We have cut our expenses to the bare bones.
 
If we were to try and sell the house we would be taking a loss.  Still would have to live somewhere.  Since my husband is a heart patient, I try to handle as much of the finances to allow him to focus on work and not be stressed.  I have not been successful as he is stressed daily between my health, our finances and the possibility of loosing our home.
 
We need your help!!  Governor Bush is there anything you can do to assist us?  Look forward to hearing from you.  Appreciate any assistance you can give.
 
Lord bless, your sister in Christ,

Mr Bush , 
 
    Joe Lester from Panama City Beach ( currently working in Oklahoma ) ....
          This may seem to be  a strange request  ,but I need a little help or guidance...  This is my problem . I'm a FAA Commercial Helicopter pilot , 3050  accident/incident flight hrs . ( 2200 in Jet helicopters )  I'm 45 yrs old , Prior service Military police .I put myself through flight school and love flying helicopters ! ...
    I'm a very proud American and I love this country so much  !.. It's difficult to watch our Armed forces fighting and dying  while I sit on the sidelines .. I feel as a citizen I'm not doing enough to help with the war on terror and  I would love to re-enter the Army as a pilot but I can't get an answer from the Army...
      I'm  very qualified , I know many Army Aviators and I have more professional flight hrs, than most 15 yr, Army Pilots !   I'm  fit/athletic and can go toe to toe with men half my age , However I'm 45 and probably viewed as an " old man "
    
   I sent an e-mail to the President and to Mr Cheney as well... I asked both Gentlemen for help in influencing the Army decision makers. I wasn't surprised to receive the standard auto-reply , just a bit disappointed.. I do hope that somehow , someway it will find it's way to them.
  IF YOU CAN GET MY E-MAIL TO THEM , I WOULD BE FOREVER IN YOU DEBT !
   
  Sir , I would quit my job tomorrow and report for duty the day after if I was allowed .
 
  Please help if you can, My best wishes to you and your family
 
  Respectfully ,

This video of our soldiers was sent to me thru my email. I cannot believe the people in charge or our men and women in Iraq allowed this! It goes beyond inhumane animal cruelty and disgusts me to know my tax dollars pay for atrocities like this. Below i have placed the link to the video. It would be nice to know someone is spoken to about this and to receive a reply to let me know my Governor cares other than the generic thank you for writing.
Thank You.

I SO much appreciate your taking the time to reply to my issue! What the problem is is that  I all ready HAVE made the attempt to go through my congress people and since it has been well over a year, they still have done NOTHING! My poor little girl has been wronged and I need something done about it, in talking to my attorney he tells me to apply to you! I guess if there really is not a thing you can do to help us, then there is just nothing you can do! I just am the only person able to fight for her and I am desperately trying and getting NO help.

I have been dealing with an awful lot of mistakes on my child's disability case! I am extremely disappointed in the way it is being handled. I am disabled and had to go to the extent of hiring an attorney to wait another year and a half just to go to a alj hearing that to me was ridiculous, my 6 yr. old daughter has a very serious mental brain disease she is schizophrenic, this disease runs in my family and they receive benefits to live! My child was kicked out of pre-school failed knidergarten and now failing first grade, noone is able to deal with this but me. school just looks the other way and offers absolutely nothing! Now, she is being denied her medical benefits through dcf as well as her food stamps. I live on disability and that only pays my rent, her father lives in another state and lives with his mom, therefore offers nothing to the child financially. I feel my daughter was wronged and that at this time you personally should  authorize her payments that she has now been denied for 3 times and not getting anywhere with the recent alj hearing! i feel after years of counseling and many medications and a mental hospital stay, she needs her benefits paid immediately! what are you able to do for my child? I have been told to at this point to contact you this told me from my attorney! Please respond asap! thank you so much for your valuable time!  Child's name: Marla dae-Estelle Atnip...

COMMENTS: To Whom It May Concern,
     My name is Amber Dennis and I am 16 years old. I am sure that you wont help 
me because nobody else would. But I am still going to ask. Here is my story:
     My grandmother, Betty Arbogast, passed away on July 8th of 2006. My 
grandfather, James Arbogast, was left with the guardianship that he shared with 
my grandmother of my 5 cousins. My grandfather retired on August 21st. The day 
that he turned 65. He is in debt at least $2500 or more that I know of. But 
please do not quote me on that because I may be wrong. He is in danger of losing 
his home and my cousins. Because if he loses his home then he will lose them 
too. He owes $1400 on rent. You should know that it was the Social Security 
Administration office that put my grandfather in debt. They made mistakes and 
then did not fix them. They took the money that was owed to my grandmother and 
they put my grandfathers bank into the red. They have not fixed it yet. My 
grandfather does not have the benefits to pay ANYTHING. They have a hold of some 
type on his retirement so he cannot get it yet. I do not know what to do to help 
my grandfather. He really needs the help. If there is!
  anything that you can do then please PLEASE let me know. In case you would 
like it my grandfathers phone number is 863*297*5611. this is also the phone 
number that you can reach me or my mother, Irene Dennis, at if you have anymore 
questions.

Dear Jeb,
  Your brother, the president, probably gets so much hate mail on the war and illegal immigration that it's impossible to reach him, so I'm writing you.
  Plese tell President Bush that I don't want to support illegal aliens, that I want the money back that I've spent supporting them in the past, that I want a fence the entire length of the border and I want him to put the needs of Americans above the needs of illegal aliens.
  Please tell him I hold no respect for him and that I consider his support of the senate amnesty bill an open invitation for all Mexican illegal aliens to come here.
  Please remind him he is not a dictator and cannot unilaterally make deals with foreign governments, as he has already done.  I am appalled that the 109th congress has allowed this man to ignore laws and run roughshod over We, the People.
  If even one American is injured by terrorists coming over our southern border with Mexico, I will find him personally responsible and hope that the American public is brought to a frenzy that results in his disgrace and incarceration.
  By the way -- did I tell you I have come to HATE PRESIDENT BUSH.

Dear Sir,


    I have never done anything like this before, so I hope you can bear with 
me and understand fully what I and my son are trying to accomplish. My son 
is 20 years old and is a Home School graduate. he has been trying to get 
into the Navy since this past March. He made a really high score on his 
ASVAB test, his Home School file was all approved and accepted at the MEPS 
center up in Montgomery, Alabama and he also cleared his physical and drug 
testing. In other words, he has passed everything for the Navy, the rest is 
to go back up and pick chose his job and swear in. The problem is he had a 
Felony when he was 14 years of age. And the Navy and the other three 
branches of out Armed Forces have labled him as a Tier II, which says he is 
a Drop-out. If he was treated as a Tier I, which is a High School graduate, 
they said he'd be in. Justin has been hanging on and waiting and waiting and 
hoping to get into the Navy since March. He is not giving up. It is his 
dream to serve his country in the U.S. Navy! I have also given you a link 
which your brother, our President and the military's Commander-in-chief did 
for Home School graduates this past Jan. 6th , please read!!!!    
http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/hslda/200601/[REDACTED].asp
As you'll read, you will see, as we did, that President Bush signed Public 
Law 109-163. You, as we did also, will also read this...."Homeschool 
graduates who desire a career with any of the four Armed Services are 
currently designated as "preferred enlistees." This means that homeschool 
graduates who enlist in the military will be treated as if they are Tier I 
candidates even though their formal status will remain Tier II. Therefore, 
homeschoolers will receive the same educational benefits, cash bonuses, and 
available positions in the Armed Services that they would receive if they 
were Tier I candidates." We have showed this to the Navy and they totally 
agree with it, but they said until it is put into their manuals, they cannot 
and will not abide by it. We want it put into all four branches of our Armed 
Forces manuals. Not only will it help Justin but any other Home School 
graduate who is facing the same problems! Please Gov. Bush, please help my 
son with this. We do not know what to do. There has got to be someone that 
can take that Law and make sure it is enforced by getting it into the 
manuals and effective immediately!!!! Justin and I do not wish to give up on 
this very important matter. We need your help, if you can or direct us as to 
who is the person that can help us. We figured since our President is your 
brother, just maybe you could get the ball rolling, so to say. We are not 
trying to change a law or make a law, we are just trying to get it into the 
military's manual, therefore enforcing it and making it effetive 
immediately. If you need Justin and I to come to Tallahasse and talk to you 
face to face, we wil. We live in Panama City, Florida...about 3 hours from 
you. If our President needs Justin and I to go to Washington and talk to him 
face to face in regards to this important issue, we will. Justin needs your 
help!! Please Gov. Bush, don't ignore us, please from the bottom of my heart 
help Justin. if yoo could see him and talk to him, you'd see he is an 
excellent candidate for our Navy. But like I already said, he has done 
everything but pick out his job and swear in. It is the Law your brother, 
our President wrote that we desperately need to be enforced and put into the 
Armed Forces and all four branches manuals and effective immediately!!! 
Thank you so much for the time you took away from your job as our highly 
respected Governor to read this.

Dear Governor Bush,
This morning at about 9:45 A.M., Gary Click, DCF in District 7 and Meg with the Legal Department at District 7 telephoned my husband to tell him that they had reviewed the documents regarding the wrong date issued by the Immigration Department which both Senator Nelson's office and Senator Haridopolos's office had seen and they were in agreement with them.  The evidence supports the date of March of 2000.  However, Gary and Meg in District 7 said that they were limited to the guidelines and could not deviate.  The approval had to come from Tallahassee.  The documents from Senator Nelson's office were being forwarded to Tallahassee for final approval which Gary and his staff indicated could be by Tuesday, October 24th.  I will keep you posted on the progress and I am grateful for your taking the time to hear me so far.

Dear Governor Bush,
Today, at 9:30 A.M., my husband had a conference call from Gary Click at District 7 DCF and the legal counsel to determine if I had proof that Mrs. Chang was to have had her LPR processed in early 2000.  The counsel asked that I fax to Gary Click's office the documents to support Mrs. Chang's error with Immigration so that the eligibility for Medicaid be established for Mrs. Chang.  After several attempts with my home fax and then with Office Depot's fax, I contacted my husband who was in a meeting in Orlando that there was a problem.  He left his meeting at lunch, went to Senator Nelson's office and picked up copies from the file with that office.   He then, hand delivered them to Gary Click at 1:30 P.M.  At delivery, my husband showed the copy of the Social Security Card issued in 1999 upon receipt of the I-485 which is required before a social security card is provided, the US Postal Money order to pay for the processing of the I-485, the signed receipt from Immigration in Orlando of the I-485 and the money to process, including the rest of the documents from Immigration approving the change of status to permanent resident dated February, 1999.  He confirmed that he would confer with Counsel to make sure these are the only documents needed to complete the investigation and telephone my husband by the deadline which is now been extended to 11:00 A.M. Friday, October 20th.  
My husband spoke with Loraine Frappe who is personally familiar with Immigration and confirmed that the issue of Mrs. Chang's Social Security Card in 1999 confirmed the start of the processing of the I-485.
I am anxious to know that the legal has been able to help Mrs. Chang.  I will continue to update the Senator's office and your office on the progress.

Subject: Kuei-Mei Tsai Chang-Social Security [REDACTED];LPR A[REDACTED]

Dear Governor Bush,
I am contacting you since I have exhausted all other areas I have been referred to in getting assistance for my mother, Kuei-Mei Tsai Chang.
My mother came to this country on September 11, 1998.  She originally came to visit me from Taiwan, but her health deteriorated and I applied for her LPR in November, 1999.  I was assured that because she was the mother of a US Citizen, there was no quota and she would be approved and dated March 2000.  
I continued checking by telephone and in person with the Orlando Immigration office and told to be patient.  After September 2001, as you know, everything came to a hault.  Once the office began processing application again, I began checking and was told that I had to prove the the I-485 had been paid with a money order.  I was able to get a copy of the US Postal Money order and finally, was told that the application was never received, even though I had the proof.  I was told to submit a duplicate application which I did at the beginning of 2005.  Instead of adding the application to the existing case, a new case was opened and started.  
Then, in October, 2005, my mother was in an automobile accident.  She did live and is on a feeding tube, blind, and in a wheel chair since her left side is paralyzed.
With the help of Congressman's Weldon's office, I was able to move her case forward and her LPR card was issued.  However, it was issued with a date of March 2006, not March, 2000 with the old case.  
Therefore, she would not qualify for any medical assistance after the insurance ran out.  Therefore, I went to Senator Nelson's office for help with correcting the wrong date.  I was told that immigration had made an error in issuing the date of March of 2006 because they had established two cases and that once the card is issued, there is no way to correct the date.  I was referred to Eric Enrique, an immigration attorney, who confirmed that although he could get the case before a Judge, there is no law requiring Department of Homeland Security to correct a mistake.  He advised that I contact a State Senator to get a waiver of the Medicaid requirement since the date is wrong and there is no law to change it.
I began working with Senator Hairdopolos office, in August,  to get a waiver for my mother.  You see, my mother is in the Titusville Rehabilitation and Nursing Center.  The insurance money ran out at the end of June, and now, my mother has to sue the insurance company for the rest of the money.  The attorneys say that it will take at least 18 months to two years.  In the meantime, Titusville Rehab issued a 30 day notice on September 20th that Mrs. Chang, regardless of her condition, is being discharged for lack of payment.
I kept telling them that the Senator's office was helping us, but, Mary Kofil, the social worker, said that she did not care.
At 3:00 P.M. this afternoon, Gary Click from the Orlando DCF telephoned to explain that so far, he has found that Mrs. Chang qualifies for Emergency Medicaid for Aliens but that he cannot find any emergency assistance for the nursing home since the Medicaid laws do not take into effect any mistakes from Deparment of Homeland Security.  After talking with Gary Click for a while, he said he would continue working to see if there is any exception that would allow assistance for Mrs. Chang in her current condition.  He referred me to the Long-term Care Ombudsman Office with Lorainne Frappe in Orlando.  She had stated that the Nursing Home cannot just leave Mrs. Chang with her condition.  The doctors have refused to remove Mrs. Chang's feeding tube since she has steadily been losing weight over the last four months.  I cannot take care of Mrs. Chang in her condition at home.
Governor Bush, even though Loraine Frappe with OMBudsman has said she cannot be just discharged, Ken VanDyck administrator with Titusville Rehabilitation and Nursing Center, called my husband at about 3:30 P.M. and told him that the discharge is scheduled for 11:00 A.M. on Friday.  If we are not there to pick her up, he will have her delivered to the house under police escort in her wheel chair with her feeding tube.
Governor Bush, I have not waited until the last minute, but, I have worked with every organization, Senator and Congressman that is in my district.  There must be some type of assistance available to someone who falls into a situation with so many errors made involveing their case.  I am really at my wits end trying to find a way to help my Mother receive Medical Care.  Please help me.  My husband must call the Titusville Center by tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 P.M. to confirm Mrs. Chang's discharge.

Well if you wanted the next Governor to be a Republican you would give the Brits there green cards on the condition that they vote.
Why do you make it so hard for the Brits to stay in America, I thought we were your greatest allies ???
I went to give blood the other day, because I was not a U.S Citizen I was not allow, but standing in line was a towel head and he was a U.S Citizen, lets hope I do not need blood in the future.

Mr. Bush,

   I am a retired veteran (Navy) and now a Government Employee with the Navy. I would like to ask you some questions and help in understanding immigration requirements. Being born, raised and schooled in the U.S. I always understood the desire of people from other countries wanting to immigrate to the U.S.; I also thought I understood the immigration laws.

   I have a dear friend from Scotland who is now 41 married with two great sons. He served 6-8 years in the Scottish regiments (Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, then the TA) and was also the Pipe Major of their world known Pipe Bands. He has always been interested in immigrating to the U.S. knowing that his sons would have better opportunities here then in Scotland. He is a licensed and practicing Funeral Director with training also in Forensic Science (not sure the extent of this though). He has applied for several positions, one in Sarasota and one in South Georgia. His problem when applying for immigrations becomes a catch 22 type situation. He stated he needed to be registered in the State first, but in order to apply he needed a permanent residence.

   Excuse me for rambling a bit; I am hoping that I can clear this up. He was over to visit just recently and he informed me that he and his family are eligible for immigrations to Australia and could be as early as February when he leaves. His immigration is based on 1) he has a skill and two he is wanted in the police pipe band there. I find this hard to understand when we hear all the time that we have so many illegal aliens in this country and our Government is willing to give them amnesty to stay. Most as we know are unskilled and have large families who will end up needing financial aide. 

   I know this is the land of opportunity, but isn’t there and hasn’t there always been rules and guidelines for all immigrants? I would rather see those with skills and no chance of becoming a burden to us here then those who will be running our coppers dry. Don’t get me wrong, this is the land of opportunity, and everyone should have a chance, but there is an extreme unfairness in the laws that I do not understand.

Please excuse me for my rambling and I am sorry to bother you. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

P.S. I did vote for you and the President (your brother) and I just hope we can continue to keep responsible people in office. I am looking for to next months elections and hope we do well!

action program. Scott has Political science and HONOURS, but it is all

suffer and have been told not to return to school because we can not pay

opertunity and where our children can have a better life. We are slowely
falling apart here, and nobody here helps. The churches here only help the
millions of AIDS orphans.
Scott wants to come over and write the bar exams. But how can he do it
when there is so much red tape. I wish the world knew what really went on
here in this ocuntry they only see what this government allows them to
see. The other terrible situation is the horrific crime. We have lost two
friends this year to violent crime.
Please ask Governor Bush to try one more time and see what he can do. I am
not giving up, because my family is suffering and it is so unneccessary.
Please can you also tel PRES GEORGE BUSH that he is the hero of my
children. They love him. Our hearts lie with America. We are not part of

Subject:	US Citizenship

Dear Madam and Sirs: 

As a native Floridian , I am writing to ask for your assistance. I have contacted the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to determine the process for becoming an illegal alien.  

My primary reason for wishing to change my status from U.S. Citizen to illegal alien stem from the bill which was recently passed by the Senate. 
If my understanding of this bill's provisions is accurate, as an illegal alien who has been in the United States for five years, all I need to do to become a citizen is to pay a $2,000 fine and income taxes for three of the last five years. I know a good deal when I see one and I am anxious to get the process started before everyone figures it out. 

Simply put, those of us who have been here legally have had to pay taxes every year so I'm excited about the prospect of avoiding two years of taxes in return for paying a $2,000 fine. Is there any way that I can apply to be illegal retroactively? This would yield an excellent result for me and my family because we paid heavy taxes in 2004 and 2005. 

Additionally, as an illegal alien I could begin using the local emergency room as my primary health care provider. Once I have stopped paying premiums for medical insurance, I could save more $10,000 a year. Another benefit in gaining illegal status would be that my daughter would receive preferential treatment relative to her law school applications, as well as "in-state" tuition rates for many colleges throughout the United States for my son. She is currently a senior in FAMU and is applying for graduate school. 

Lastly, I understand that illegal status would relieve me of the burden of renewing my driver's license and making those burdensome car insurance premiums. This is very important to me given that I still have college age children driving my car.

If you would provide me with an outline of the process to become illegal (retroactively if possible) and copies of the necessary forms, I would be most appreciative. Thank you for your assistance. 

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. LD McDonald
 
I did not write the e mail for the purpose of the solicitation of sympathy from the Governor, although in some tangential way, I do appreciate it.  Please thank him for extending it to me.
 
I hope I did not mislead you with the subject of the e mail "I don't have a Congressman."  As you may know, Governor Bush and the current US President are kin.  He is the head of my party.  My purpose was to transmit informantion to the President.  I'll try to be more direct in this regard.  I doubt however that your suggestion that I contact Bill Nelson will help solve the political/energy/national security problem facing the nation and the Republican Party at this time.
 
Please read the e mail and see if you can help me.  If you can't, that's ok.  Just say so.  If you can send it up the chain of command one step, then fine.  Have your boss send me the next response.
 
Thank you.

Dear Mr. Bush,

I have lived in Tampa, Florida for more than ten years as a resident alien. This morning whilst at the local office of Homeland Security, I was absolutely sickened at what I saw in line at the security check point. Standing in front of me was an elderly Hispanic lady waiting to go through the metal detector, she clearly was not English speaking. One of the security guards tried to get past her. Insted of politely saying excuse me to the lady he continued to say "lady, move! LADY MOVE! lady move out of the way! and then put his hand on her shoulder and pushed her gently out of the way. Everything in me wanted to speak up and tell the guy to respect his elders, but truly I was afraid that it might somehow jeapordize me getting my papers updated. I hope that this complaint is taken seriously. I understand that we are not citizens of this country, but we are tax paying, law abiding people that deserve the same rights as any other human deserves. I dont know the person who was mi!
 streated, nor can I even speak her language, Sir you can say something and not have to fear repercussions. Thank you and much respect.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

First of all I am we will miss you when your term ends. Now for the letter.

 

We are having a huge dilemma and don’t know where to turn. My wife Alejandra has applied for residency in the US around Oct 2004, we have already been through all the INS red tape, and have even gotten as far as our interview as a married couple on March 23, 2006. At that point we were told that we should be receiving correspondence from the INS within days for her to come down and have her passport stamped as a resident. 

 

Needless to say 30 days came and went with nothing, so we contacted INS and were told that they had no answer yet. We were very perplexed since after the interview we were told that we would get the residency card in the mail. We contacted our immigration attorney and after he inquired were told that she was selected for a random background check and that there was no time frame on how long that would take.

 

Well here is where we really need your help. Alejandra’s mother is 68 and was staying with us for vacation began to feel some pain in her hip; she was taken to the Dr. who diagnosed her with a broken hip. She immediately returned to Colombia so that she could have surgery preformed, and was told by her Dr’s that she has a tumor around her hip and that they would have to remove it before they could even begin to mend her hip and that she would require assistance with her recovery.

 

Needless to say my wife who is an only child who would like to be with, and help her mother who herself has no one who can help her in Colombia since she is a widow. Of course my wife may not leave the country because her case is still pending with INS, and her attorney strongly advised her against filing an I-131 for advance parole, because he said that it may have an adverse reaction on her return. His understanding is that the file is in "investigation" and there is no idea when the file will be complete. THIS IS LUDACRIS, it has been well over 6 months since our interview was completed and two years since the petition was files. How long does it take for the USCIS to review and close a file?

 

Is there any, or do you know ANYONE that we can appeal to help get this case moved forward? My wife Alejandra would like nothing more then to be able to be with her mother in her time of need, and yet some breakdown in the system has put her case an indefinite limbo.

 

Most of these e-mails fall on deaf ears, and as an American Citizen I am embarrassed by the lack of any feelings that the bearcats have. However I will keep on trying to help my wife see her mother before she dies.

 

Thank You,

Dear Govenor Bush
 
My name is Pamela J. Colbert, I wrote you a couple of years ago regarding a workmans compensation accident in 2002, you were very helpful with that, for that I thank you again.
 
I once again need your help.  I am a 48 year old single white female, since the injury, I have tried to work which is impossible. I have applied for Social Security and been denied a few times (I hear this is normal??) I have obtained an attorney which I am told is necessary (that is sad) I have a severe neck, back, and hip injury from the original accident in 2002.  The state has finally granted me food stamps (barely enough to eat on) I am not able to receive ANY medical help. I seem to fall through the cracks, I am in dire need of medical help, without proper medical care and medications I am unable to walk , stand or sit for any length of time.  I received a letter from the atty's that our SSI SSD system is now backlogged and to be patient it will only be a few months.  I was diagnosed by SSI/SD doctors along with my physical impairments I also have severe depression, post traumatic stress syndrome and a few other things. If SSI/SSD doctors say that I am unable to work then WHY? am I slowly loosing everything I have,? I write you as I will be homeless next month. This letter is very hard for me to write, I have worked in the State of FL since age 16 always paid my taxes and the system does not seem to work. I need some medical help to fix me or if permanate as I am told then given some releif and give me proper medical care. I cannot wait a couple of months, I have no husband or any other family support, so tell me Mr Bush in this situation what shall I do?  My education and prior hard work seem to be used against me.  I am not a lazy bum nor am I a drug addict. I am really hurt physically and mentally by this, my life is very hard right now. HOW can you work in the US /FL all of your life be hurt and not receive help, even when SSI/SSD doctors say the same thing I am saying.
 
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me before I am living on the streets!

He has tried to get  copies of his medical records but they are saying that they lost them, however a couple of months ago he received his  bronze star. Social Security is saying that  he has not worked enough years to receive this benefit and we need help with this matter. I will contact the media and do what I need to get the word out about this.

Dear Gov. Bush,

 

I am sure you are not the one to receive this e-mail however I will still address it to you.  I have written in the past about my disability claim filled with the state.  I originally filled in 10/2004.  I have been through the appeals process and currently have been waiting for a court date for over a year now.  This process is not only mentally straining but physically.  I have tried to contact the office to find out the status of my case and they have refused to provide me with information.  I have sent letters to update them on my current health and family status (still have not worked since 10/2004, gone to all appointments, for over a year I have been seeing mental health specialist; diagnosed with major depression and sever anxiety, my father committed suicide last September)  that is just to state a few.  This whole process continues to take a toll on my self as well as my family.  I have health insurance however the co-pays are costly.  My husband is trying to support me and two children with health needs as well on his salary as a deputy.  I have met people that received disability on the first try but are not even sick nor have they worked.  The system is failing.  I have pleaded with your office via e-mail and letters, my local representatives, social security, and others.  I am getting no where except further in debt wit h no resolution.  I have worked more than 10 years in public service but get nothing in return.  I asked how the state can say I can still work in the capacity of a police officer yet they revoked my certification due to health and syncope on the job.  They acknowledge limitations in my physical abilities yet say I can perform a job in the hospital as a tech.  Prior to leaving my position at the hospital I was doing as minimal as possible.  I was denied access to the nursing program due to physical limitations.  I was advised to resign from the hospital due to not being able to perform my job, missed work, and a liability to the employer.  I do not know where to go from here.  I have an Attorney that was suggested by Social Security but have not received any answers from them either.  Please I am pleading with your staff to offer any assistance possible to help me resolve this.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Good afternoon, Sir

My name is Andre and I wonder if you could help me on this subject.
I´m living in Portugal and I want to go to Florida for good, i´v been
there last year on vacations, My wife has Family living in Plantation
and they are American citizens.
And I went to an interview in a company that like me very much and
they would like to hire me in the future but, that company as an
internal law that don´t sponsor foreigners. My question is: is there
any way for me to went in Florida and get a work visa, without
applying at the usually way, at this moment I have tree company's
that would hire me if I have a license to work in Florida, and it´s
frustrating knowing that, they say that my resume is very good, I just
want a better life for me and my family and we love America.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon, I remain

Yours Faithfully

Mr. Bush:
     I am writing to you in reference to a 20 year old male that came into this country in May, 2006. He traveled from Spain where he is a citizen to Mexico and crossed the border into Brownsville, TX. He declared that he was a Cuban and asked for political asylum. This is not his case because he is a citizen of Spain and has lived in this country since he was 12 years old.Simply he was trying too escape from his obligations by coming to this country. He has left behind an 8 month old baby and his mother who is only about 18. He has left the parents of this young girl who trusted him enough to ask for loan against their house thinking that he would repay the loan, but instead he took off. Now, they are about too loose their home because they cannot afford the payments and he does not send them any money whatsoever.Not even for his baby.He currently receives medicaid, food stamps, and cash from Children and Families. His name is Arturo Alvarez and resides in 2700 Connie Circle, Orange Park, Fl. 32065. Last week the Clay County Sherriff's police confronted because there was an accusation made in Spain that he had raped a girl and that he would sell drugs there just like his father, His father is in jail in Spain for selling drugs. In my opinion he should be sent back to Spain where he is a citizen, so he confronts his obligations. I do not think he should be allowed to stay in this country where he has given false information and is simply using U.S. funds which are much needed for other important matters. Please, conduct yourself accordingly in resolving this matter.I think this individual should not be allowed in this country.

Subject: visas



Ma’am,

 

 

   My name is Nicholas Darwin Yancey; I am a resident of the great state of Florida.   I am currently serving in our nation’s Air Force, as a health services administration journeyman, and am stationed at Kadena AB in Okinawa, Japan. I would like to seek you assistance in a matter dealing with immigration of my family members to the United States. I have submitted an application to the US Consulate, Naha for my wife and step daughter's immigrant visas so they may join my youngest daughter and me upon our relocation to the states. Ma’am, my wife and stepdaughter are Filipino citizens. I began their visa application process in July of 2006 and have run into a little bit of trouble. Around the first part of July, we submitted part one of the application; shortly thereafter they informed us they had not accepted the documents as my wife was missing some addresses, and my stepdaughter’s birth certificate had an administrative error. We returned to the consulate around the latter part of July. At this encounter they informed us the papers were still incomplete because my wife had not included the correct addresses from her birth until now. After providing the requested information, the consulate staff informed us they would have to contact the Philippine Embassy in Manila, Philippines. They said that it would take six to eight weeks just to hear back from the Philippine Embassy. It has now been 12 weeks, and I still haven't heard anything from the Embassy. Here is where my problem lies. I am scheduled to depart Okinawa on December 9, 2006 for my next assignment in the states.  If I don't hear back from the US Consulate, Naha by the middle of September, I will most likely not have enough time to complete part two of the immigrant visa process. This is because it currently takes between two and four weeks to get a medical exam at the only medical facility, Adventist Clinic, on Okinawa authorized to complete the physical portion of the application. Following this appointment it will take another two to three weeks for the results to be submitted to the consulate staff, then another three to four weeks for the part two appointment at the US Consulate, Naha for her interview. Should they grant the visa at this appointment, the visas would not be issued until around the middle of December, which is beyond my scheduled departure window. With the current travel issues in airports around the world, this would make traveling alone very difficult and intimidating to say the least. Any assistance you could offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

 

 

Here again is where my problem lies Naha said they contacted the United States embassy in manila to do a fraud and marriage index on my wife Melouzina Oliver Yancey formally known as Melouzina Gerfaldo Oliver DOB: 31 Jan 1975   before she got married. And also on my step daughter Ma.Mariane Ashly Oliver DOB 19 NOV 1996. They told me it would take about 6 to 8 weeks to hear back from them, it has been about 11 and a half. I am leaving here in about 7 weeks. Would like to know if there is anything you would be able to do to speed up this process. My contact in Naha is Roskamp, Philip W [RoskampPW@state.gov].    And here is some more info you might find useful. 

 

 

My wife's full name as on her application Passport # and DOB

Name: Yancey, Melouzina Oliver

DOB: 01-31-1975

Passport: Philippines Passport No. KK795440

 

Her application # as filed with the consulate at Naha Case number: NHA2006193001

 

Any case # for Manila?

As far as I know, cases we send to Manila for investigation do not receive a case number.  Manila can correct me if I am wrong.

 

Has she been assigned an A #?  Her permanent file # Since the petition has not been approved, she has not been assigned an A number.  I am not sure what is meant by a permanent file number.  We only assign a case number here at Post.  

 

Your stepdaughter full name as on her application DOB?

Name: Oliver, Ma. Mariane Ashly

DOB: 11-19-1996

Passport: Philippines Passport No. SS0805189

 

Her application # as filed with the consulate at Naha Case number: NHA2006193002

 

This information was given to me on SEPT 8,2006 

 

 

In the end all I am trying to do is get my wife and step daughter's USA visas to go back to the states with me and my infant daughter. I really don't think that is asking too much as a United States Military Member. Any help anybody can give is welcomed.

Subject:	Re: DEA 's WAR AGAINST DOCTORS

Dear Governor Bush and Assistant:
I very much appreciate the response to my letter although it was not what I had hoped for.  I feel the Governor does have some interest in this travesty simply because it involves not only the Federal Government, but also the FDLE in cooperation with, and a part of the Joint Task Force.  These agencies have become hired guns.  With so much going on in this very state, I find it difficult to wrap my brain around local law enforcement and their eagerness to target the very men that they turn to when they are sick or injured.  It is really very simple.  The DEA and others can't win the REAL war on illegal drugs so they have found easy targets.  Family men who keep records, dedicate themselves for years to helping others and they don't shoot back.  The small town family physician is practically non-existent, but proudly I was married to one and he provided a valuable service to a very poor community.  And how is he thanked?   He retires in hopes to raise his youngest son, 9 years old, and is assaulted by this act of terrorism two months after retirement.  We have both been model citizens, active in the last two elections, even attended the President's Dinner June of 2005.  How disappointing that the very government that I have so vigorously supported would treat my husband and my family in such an egregious manner.  My  children are terrorized and I am so fearful for the fate of a wonderful and loving man I am proud to call my husband.  His former patients are appalled. If you read some of the literature concerning the DEA's tactics you might be appalled also.  I thought maybe I could turn to my own elected official for some ray of hope. 
Sincerely,
 
Teresa P. Ignasiak

Subject: DEA 's WAR AGAINST DOCTORS


Dear Governor Bush;
I am writing to you out of hope and desperation.  Are you aware of the aggressive pursuit and prosecution of doctors who, in line with accepted medical practice, are simply attempting to care for their patients presenting with chronic or intractable pain by prescribing medication to relieve pain in order for the patient to function and lead a productive life?  Are you aware that a Joint Task Force consisting of the DEA, FBI, FDLE and US Attorney's Office are targeting physicians and charging them with counts of conspiracy to traffic drugs, drug trafficking, racketeering and even MURDER? 
Governor Bush, my husband and I are proud to call ourselves professionals and law abiding citizens.  But now, my own husband is under
investigation.  He spent 21 years in private practice in Freeport, FLorida, a town which had no doctor at the time he set up his clinic.  We worked together and provided a much needed service to this small community and during those 21 years he never had a law suit filed against him.  He was, and is beloved by his patients.  When his patients were too elderly or ill to come to him, he would make house calls.  I can't think of another physician who does that anymore. 
Bob retired in December 2005.  Our youngest child is 8 years old and he desperately wanted to spend more time with him  Our other 3  children ages 28, 17, and 15 spent most of their youth without Dad at home.
I pray that you  will read some of the articles and cases which detail this crisis.  Our country should not make our physicians the enemy because the DEA is losing the REAL war on drugs.  Physicians are given a license to prescribe controlled medicines and then are fearful of being prosecuted for doing it.  And for good reason.  Many have been imprisoned for life.  
My husband is a compassionate and caring man.  I am sure this is the reason he is so missed by his former patients.  Many have written
to him stating how much they miss him and how no other doctor can take his place. 
In closing, I want to tell you how afraid I am of what is happening to us.  Yesterday the FBI called my husband's cell phone and asked where they could meet him in order to serve him with a subpoena.  We had our 8 year old son with us at the time which I explained to the agent.  We met at an agreed location within the hour and after Bob was served I realized that we were being photographed.  Another undercover agent pretended to "notice" that we were being photographed and presented himself as a "good Samaritan" by telling us.  I quickly came to the realization that he had to tell us in order to make it legal.  The FBI has admitted to me that this is true.  I know you are a father.  How would you feel about having your small child filmed without your knowledge, especially when you are trying to cooperate as any honest and innocent citizen would? 
I would very much like to meet with you to discuss this situation.  My family's welfare is at stake and most importantly my husband's future.  This family cannot live without him.  He is the most wonderful man I have ever known and anyone who knows him will verify that.  
Do we really want to live in a country where law enforcement officials tell doctors how to treat their patients?  Do we want to live in a state where staking out a law abiding family and targeting a retired physician is the norm?  Real people have real pain and they are entitled to treatment without fear of reprisal.  Physicians are ones we turn to for care and treatment.  Should they live their life looking over their shoulder because they treated someone for pain along with every other illness which presented itself?  I say definitely no.  If you will just take a moment to check into what is happening in our great state and in the nation you will see the terrible injustice raining down on those who devoted their entire lives to helping others.

How bad is Florida, compared to California?? I would like to know. Please respond.

Immigration

How do you think that this is going to affect our grand children in years to come?

From the L. A. Times:

1. 40% of all workers in L. A. County (L. A. County has 10 million people) are working for cash and not paying taxes. This was because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card.

2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.

3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.

4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.

5. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here
illegally.

6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.

7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.

8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.

9. 21 radio stations in L A. are Spanish speaking.

10. In L. A. County 5.1 million people speak English. 3.9 million speak Spanish (10.2 million people in L. A. County).

(All the above from the Los Angeles Times)


Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.

Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth (and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York) results from immigration.

The cost of immigration to the American taxpayer in 1997 was, (after subtracting taxes immigrants pay), a NET $70 BILLION a year, [Professor Donald Huddle, Rice University]. 

The lifetime fiscal impact (taxes paid minus services used) for the average adult Mexican immigrant is a NEGATIVE number.

29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.

If they can come to this country to raise Hell and demonstration by the thousands, Why can't they take charge over the corruption in their own country?

We are a bunch of fools for letting this continue.

THE U.S. VS MEXICO: On February 15, 1998, the U.S. and Mexican soccer teams met at the Los Angeles Coliseum. The crowd was overwhelmingly pro-Mexican even though most lived in this country. They booed during the National Anthem and U.S. flags were held upside down. As the match progressed, supporters of the U.S. team were insulted, pelted with projectiles, punched and spat upon. Beer and trash were thrown at the U.S. players before and after the match. The coach of the U.S. team, Steve Sampson said, "This was the most painful experience I have ever had in this profession"

Did you know that immigrants from Mexico and other non-European countries can come to this country and get preferences in jobs, education, and government contracts? It's called affirmative action or racial privilege. The Emperor of Japan or the President of Mexico could migrate here and immediately be eligible for special rights unavailable for Americans of European descent.

Corporate America has signed on to the idea that minorities and third world immigrants should get special, privileged status. Some examples are Exxon, Texaco, Merrill Lynch, Boeing, Paine Weber, Starbucks and many more.

DID YOU KNOW?: That Mexico regularly intercedes on the side of the defense in criminal cases involving Mexican nationals? Did you know that Mexico has NEVER extradited a Mexican national accused of murder in the U.S. in spite of agreements to do so?

According to the L. A. Times, Orange County, California is home to 275 gangs with 17,000 members; 98% of which are Mexican and Asian. How's your county doing?

According to a New York Times article dated May 19, 1994, 20 years after the great influx of legal immigrants from Southeast Asia, 30% are still on welfare compared to 8% of households nationwide. A Wall Street Journal editorial dated December 5, 1994 quotes law enforcement officials as stating that Asian mobsters are the "greatest criminal challenge the country faces." Not bad for a group that is still under 5% of the population.

Is education important to you? Here are the words of a teacher who spent over 20 years in the Los Angeles School system. "Imagine teachers in classes containing 30-40 students of widely varying attention spans and motivation, many of whom aren't fluent in English. Educators seek learning materials likely to reach the majority of students and that means fewer words and math problems and more pictures and multicultural references."

WHEN I WAS YOUNG: I remember hearing about the immigrants that came through Ellis Island They wanted to learn English. They wanted to breathe free. They wanted to become Americans. Now, far too many immigrants come here with demands. They demand to be taught in their own language. They demand special privileges--affirmative action. They demand ethnic studies that glorify their culture.

HOW CAN YOU HELP?: Send copies of this letter to at least two other people, 100 would be even better. Help us get the word out:

Do you know what happened....
156 years ago!

This week back in 1850:
California became a state.

The State had no electricity.

The State had no money.
Almost everyone spoke Spanish.

There were gun fights in the streets. 

So basically, it was just like California today except the women had
real breasts and men didn't hold hands.

Subject:	[*] View on Immigration

Dear Honorable Governor Bush:
 
I am a freshman at Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida.  I am sending an email to you regarding my views on immigration.  Immigration has been a hot topic both on a Federal and State level.  I would like to understand what measures you have taken on immigration during your term as governor.  
 
Immigration has many pros and cons.  My views are against allowing illegal immigrants into the United States.  I feel the borders should be more secure and a Visa or green card should be harder to obtain.  Illegal immigrants are taxing our state and national governments both financially and socially.  Illegal immigrants are not paying their fair share of taxes but expect the services that taxpayers are entitled to.  Also, our education system is being affected by this problem.  Teachers are expected to teach children that have not learned English.  More time is taken with these children and less on those that legally live in Florida.  Also, the issue of security to our borders needs to be addressed so we have a safer state with less crime and less ability for terrorists to invade us.
 
The favor of a reply regarding your views and actions during your term would be appreciated.  Also, do you feel your agenda will be carried on when a new governor is elected next month?
 
With kind regards,

Subject:	[*] Deportation of Dahianna Heard

Governor Bush,
 
I am writing regarding what appears to be the imminent deportation of Dahianna Heard. I am all in favor of immigration reform, and tightening our borders to ensure that all people who enter our country do so legally.
 
I am, however OUTRAGED that Dahianna Heard has followed all the rules, her husband has made the ultimate sacrifice and given his life for his country, yet his widow and child are doomed to be kicked out of the USA????? What kind of message does this send? That people who follow the rules and are making an effort to become citizens of the US get booted, yet countless thousands of other illegal immigrants remain??? She is only 3 months short of being able to stay, and Immigration Services chooses the family of an American war hero as the family they intend to deport?
 
I simply cannot tell you how angry this makes me and my family. I strongly urge you to use all means in your power to assist the Heard family so that they may stay in our country.
 
Thank you for any assistance you can render.
 
Sincerely

Governor Bush,
 
What the heck is this country coming to?  We send our Men off to fight in a war and don't protect and take care of their families?  There is a woman in Florida named Dahianna Heard, her husband was a Army Veteran and served in the National Guard for this Country, he was working in Iraq as a contractor, he was attacked and killed execution style.
 
She was 3 months away from her green card when he was killed, they have a 1 year old child.  He was delivering supplys to our Troops!!!  Their second anniversary would have been in July.  Now the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. is going to deport her because Jeffrey Heard died 3 months before the deadline.  Upon his death they voided her petition for a green card, which was her first step toward Citizenship.
 
This man was a Veteran and served his country, he died supplying our Troops and this is how our Government thanks this family for their sacrifice??????  What the hell is going on?  You need to get involved in this and help right this wrong.  I am so appalled at the lack of humanity shown this family.  This poor Veteran is turning over in his grave.  No wonder other countries think we're callous, if this is how we treat our own.  
 
Governor Bush, please do what you can by getting involved to help this family as she is from Casselberry Florida.

Subject:	SSD Question Please

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I previously wrote to you (a copy of that email is at the end of this letter) with regard to SSD and the fact that I had not heard from them regarding my application for disability.  I would just like to keep you up to date on what is going on.  I'm very discouraged at what I'm seeing in the way of medical reports from one of the doctors to whom I'd been referred by SSD.  I've included in this email copies of the reports, correspondence from me to one of the doctors and my correspondence to SSD.
Dr. Kanakis's report is at issue here (see my corrections below).  
 
I'm not expecting you to do anything about this personally, but I wanted to share with you what has been happening in my case, and to let you know that something just isn't right here.  I'm not sure who oversees SSD and their practices and/or their referred physicians, but honestly I believe this should be brought to someone's attention.  I understand it takes quite a long time to be qualified or denied, but things such as what I've been having to deal with just add to the wait and I've already been out of work for 7 months with no income and to have to wait much longer will result in my losing the few material things I have in my life, not to mention that my medical condition is getting worse day by day.  
 
Thank you for listening and for any assistance in this matter.

Dear Dr. Kanakis:
 
The Department of Health, Social Security Disability, for a psychological examination, referred me to you in reference to my applying for disability due to my medical problems.  In your report, you stated several incorrect responses on my part, as well as omitting several responses which I consider extremely critical in determination of benefits.  I am enclosing a copy of a letter I sent to SSD as a response/correction to your report on our session.
 
These are blatant misstatements and I have made it a point to let SSD know that your report is incorrect.  I’m not sure why you would change the details of what we talked about and I would like an explanation, as well as a corrected, truthful report sent to SSD as soon as possible.
 
While the lower half of my body isn’t functioning as it should be, my brain works just fine.  I can tell you, verbatim, the answers I gave to the questions you posed to me in our session.  You left out critical information as far as I know, in addition to making false statements about alcohol use (see enclosed).  As you well know, SSD is extremely difficult to obtain if alcohol or drug abuse is involved.  In the beginning of our session, you made it a point to tell me that you stated you had nothing to do with SSD or eligibility of patients referred to you, but I’ve since learned that is not the case.  All one has to do is go to your website, and there it makes it clear that you are connected to disability issues.
 
I’m not quite sure why you chose to falsify my psychological examination report, and honestly, I would love an explanation from you.  And, again, I am requesting that you correct this report and forward a copy of it directly and immediately to SSD and my rep there.  In case you need the address, here it is:

Re: Jennifer Lynn Heyser
SSN:  [REDACTED]
Casenbr:  1453326
 
In response to Dr. Kanakis’s report dated 09/05/2006, I would like to correct the following statements he made:
 
Relevant Background information
 
Paragraph 1:
 
I reported that I’d had somewhat of a volatile relationship with my father at the age of 15 wherein my father found out through my sister that I’d been having sexual intercourse. I also told Dr. Kanakis that I never got along with my adoptive sister who is two years older than I.  I stated to Dr. Kanakis that my father got out of control and grabbed me by the neck and held me up against a wall, calling me a slut and a whore before letting me down.  I also told Dr. Kanakis that my father and I did not speak to each other for two years after that incident, but that as I grew older, our relationship has become one of mutual respect as we put aside (as in never ever mentioned) the past.
 
Paragraph 5:
 
I, indeed, did tell Dr. Kanakis that I suffered a head trauma in 1976 at the hands of my husband (then boyfriend) wherein I caught him in bed with another woman, left the scene and attempted to go home.  (I don’t believe I mentioned to him about finding him with the woman however because I was getting upset at going back to all that bad stuff.)  He followed me outside while I was waiting for a cab and blind-sided me with a fist to the left side of my face.  I fell to the ground (sidewalk) and the impact split my head open requiring a trip to the emergency room to get 10 stitches in the right backside of my head.  I’d gone unconscious for approximately 30 minutes while my boyfriend picked me up from the sidewalk, put me in his car and drove me to the hospital.  I came to during the drive to the hospital, not having any clue as to what happened to me, felt a pounding in my head, reached up and felt something wet and sticky where it hurt, took my hand down and saw it was blood.  I didn’t realize he hit me until after the doctors started asking me what happened.  It took me about 30 minutes to finally register it all and then I more or less figured out that I’d been socked in the face and had blunt force trauma.  
 
I married this person and mild to severe physical, along with great emotional, abuse was a part of my life for the next 18 years.  I was afraid to turn him in because we had two little babies and he insisted that I stay home and care for them and I had no money and no self-worth and he continually told me that no one would have me and he’d leave me out to dry.
 
I also mentioned that I experience very bad migraine headaches on occasion wherein I lose partial sight.  I also answered his question about having blackouts or seizures in the positive.  I do have blackouts (and not from alcohol intake either) where I experience unbalance in equilibrium and just pass out or faint.  I come back to consciousness within 10-15 minutes I’m told after onset, and I was told that my body shakes during these episodes.  I told Dr. Kanakis that I’d been to a medical center trying to find out what the problem is with the blacking out but that no one could find anything wrong.  My father also experienced these same sorts of blackouts when he was younger.
 
I am not sure why Dr. Kanakis chose to report that I had no abuse in my history, or why he didn’t mention the migraines or the blackout episodes.  
 
Paragraph 6:
 
I did NOT report to Dr. Kanakis that I drank a 12-pack of beer on a daily basis.  I drink one beer daily (except on Sundays) so that’s 6 beers a week.  If I go out, which I haven’t in the past 8 months or more, I will, only socially, have one or two beers with a meal.  The reason I drink beer is that it helps dull the pain and ease the mind.  I do not drink and drive.  My mother was an alcoholic and I know only too well that I am very susceptible to the disease or downfall.  I put my own mother through rehab and detox when she was 71 years old because I didn’t want her to die.  She survived that and is now almost 90 and has been sober since.  There is no way I would do that to myself or to my children.  My father, who is 92, has one drink every evening and I see nothing wrong with that.  
 
One more note on this.  I do not have money to purchase alcohol.  Even the cigarette smoking has slowed down to almost a halt because of the cost.  I know what’s important in order to live a good decent life and that’s what I try to do.  My own ignorant vices do get set aside when it’s necessary and for the past several months, that has been an absolute necessity.  I’m not a bum who begs others for liquor, cigarettes or money and I don’t ever want to become someone like that. 
 
Paragraph 8:
 
Dr. Kanakis asked me what I do on a daily basis.  My response was that I sleep a lot.  I do not sleep at night, maybe 2 or 3 hours at a time because of the discomfort of whatever is going on with my bones, joints, body, etc.  So if I feel like dozing for a few minutes during the day, I will do that.  I cannot stay in any one position for more than 10 minutes at a time before shooting pains start.  I watch television mostly on Tuesday nights (one show).  If I sit or lay on the sofa, I will turn the television on to watch the news, the history or discovery channel.  I’ve always disliked television, even as a kid, and I find it an insult to intelligence for the most part.  My daily routine is to get up, take a shower so I am clean, make sure my cat is fed and taken care of, eat an apple and some peanut butter for breakfast/lunch and a chicken Caesar salad for an early dinner.  I do not snack nor do I eat anything with sugar in it (my mother has diabetes and I don’t want to get it any sooner than I have to).  I drink milk, chocolate milk, diet cokes, plain seltzer, orange juice and water on a daily basis.  I take multi-vitamins, calcium supplements, as well as over the counter supplements for sore joints and bones.  I do not engage in using illegal drugs of any sort at the present time and haven’t since 1975.  I did not smoke or drink prior to or while I was pregnant with my twins.  
 
I keep my house surface-clean for the most part.  It hurts to stand and do the dishes after about 5 minutes leaning over the sink.  I use a light mop to wipe down the floors in my house and it hurts my body to even do this much.  My house is not spotless and sometimes I just don’t care if it’s dusty.  I will take the prescribed pain medication prior to doing any household work (and when I used to mow my lawn) because I cannot do any of it any longer without it.  I do not mow my lawn anymore either.  My heart pounds and I sweat profusely and my joints and bones hurt to the point where I cannot stand straight up after lightly pushing forward the SELF-propelled mower for maybe 5 minutes.  I will no longer put my heart at risk doing yard work, nor do I want to injure my joints or back any further.   
 
As far as driving goes, I will get into my car and go to the corner grocery store for what I need.  I do not drive long distances if it’s not necessary.  I do not trust my legs or my elbows to the point of being able to avoid accidents if they should occur.  I cannot endure the ten-minute walk to the corner store and back to my home.  My legs start burning with pain and because of the extreme pain in my heels, my balance isn’t so good because I cannot put pressure on my heels.  I am afraid to drive for the most part.
 
Presenting Appearance and Mental Status:
 
My gait is NOT normal and steady.  What Dr. Kanakis witnessed was pain medication at work.  It hurt to sit on his couch.  It hurt to get up.  I was uncomfortable during the 40-minute session because of the pain and aches in my lower back and legs.  I told him I was in pain just sitting there.  Appearances are just that.  I am embarrassed to walk the way I walk now, with small steps, not entirely balanced, but if I do have to go out in public, I will try to maintain composure and some steadiness as best I can without drawing attention and stares of others to myself.  
 
To update you on my mental condition, I have been more depressed.  Whatever is wrong with me is getting worse.  I’ve run out of money, have no medication and cannot get out of bed or up from a sitting position without using a cane I purchased.  I have entertained thoughts of possible suicide … walking into the Gulf and just not caring anymore.  I do not recall Dr. Kanakis asking me about thoughts of suicide, nor did I volunteer that information at the time of my appointment.  I valued my life while I was being abused.  I somehow managed, with the help of my God, to get myself out of that situation with no help from anyone else.  I am somewhat heavily scarred and indifferent to the state of matrimony and men in general, but I would, however, never take my own life, no matter how bad it gets.  The main reason is because of my religious upbringing and the fact that I am too young to stop living a normal life.  I need and want to get well enough to be able to go back to work eventually and be productive and useful to someone and for good cause.  I need that in my life.  I also have two wonderfully beautiful and intelligent daughters and I want and need to be here for them for a long time to come.
 
 
I have a decent sense of humor.  I am a good and honest person.  I am anti-social for the most part but I always attempt to do what’s necessary for me to maintain my sense of self and sanity.  Because of whatever my medical problems are, and the fact that I hurt 24/7, it’s not easy staying afloat.  I haven’t been able to concentrate on much of anything lately.  My goal is to get financial help through social security disability which I feel I deserve, get the medical attention that I need, and try to get back into the work force at least part time in a paid position and do some volunteer work.  I’ve had to apply for food stamps, financial assistance and Medicaid this past week because I am without money and have no financial resources.  For me, it’s embarrassing to have to do all of this, because I’ve always stood on my own two feet and made my own way through everything without help from anyone.  I want to go back to being that person again but I know I can’t do it by myself this time.

Email sent to Governor Bush regarding my question about SSD:
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a 54-year-old female with medical problems.  I had to quit my job because of my disabilities and now have no health insurance.  I applied for Social Security Disability in June of this year.  I've been to their doctor appointment set up for me.  I've tried contacting my rep at SSD but I've had no return call.
 
My situation is this:  I believe I'm suffering from osteoarthritis and sciatic nerve damage.  In 2005 I underwent a complete hysterectomy because of internal bleeding.  This was an emergency because I became anemic and in constant extreme pain.  My health insurance company, at the time, gave authorization for the surgery.  Once it was done, I received notice that the procedure I had was not covered.  This left me with hospital and doctor bills totaling over $15,000, all of which my health insurance did not even consider paying.  They indicated to me that it was not of "emergency" nature.  
 
Within six months of that surgery, I began feeling worse.  I was experiencing shooting pains in both elbows and could not use my arms without being in extreme pain.  An MRI showed bone degeneration in the elbow.  My doctor referred me to a rheumatoid specialist (I do not have rheumatoid arthritis) and that doctor merely gave me a shot of cortisone in my right elbow and took no x-rays or performed any other tests.
 
Shortly after that, my lower back, hips, knees, legs, ankles and the heels of my feet began to hurt.  The pain has been excruciating to the point where I cannot lift, reach, bend, lay, walk, sit, stand, or use my limbs without feeling pain.  I have trouble sleeping.  I cannot do any of the above things for longer than 10 minutes before I feel shooting burning pain throughout the lower half of my body.  The pain never goes away and it gets worse every day.
 
Since quitting my job, I haven't had money for health insurance.  I was eligible for COBRA but at the cost of $350 per month, I couldn't afford it.  Two specialists would not even see me because I had NO insurance -- I told them I would be a 'self-pay' patient and they still refused to see me.
 
I then applied for the disability.  I'm going on 6 months now with no income.  I've exhausted my life savings and have maybe $200 in my bank account.  I have nothing to fall back on.  My only assets are my house ($350/mo. mortgage payment) and my 1999 vehicle, which keeps breaking down.  I take blood pressure medicine along with an anti-anxiety medication due to stress, and the pain pills that have been prescribed to me so I can just get out of bed in the mornings.  
 
I've worked since I was 17 years old and I've worked hard.  I was married, have two children (both in their 4th year of college now), and for 18 years was subjected to spousal abuse by the man I married.  I was one of the lucky ones and got out, but it cost me dearly.  I had to file bankruptcy back in 1997 because of the circumstances surrounding my divorce.  I went back to work in 1997 after being a mother and a housewife for 12 years.  Then in 1999 one of my daughters developed a brain tumor.  Being a single mother with two children and an ex who didn't care if I lived or died, I was forced to use all my savings to live on.  But nonetheless I continued to work and try to make a decent life for my kids given the situation.
 
I'm not complaining about my life.  I'm just very worried and scared because I have nothing now to fall back on.  My only hope is social security disability.  I even explained to them before I filed for it that one day I hope to be able to go back to work because it makes me feel productive.  They explained the "back to work ticket" possibility and that was just what would suit me once my medical problems have been addressed.
 
I cannot address my medical problems as it stands now.  I feel like I'm getting more physically and emotionally crippled with each day that goes by.  I am desperate for financial assistance now before what little I have is gone.
 
Can you help me at all?
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I appreciate it very much.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Governor,
I know how busy you are with all of the problems of the state but I hope 
you get to read this article as it points out how we are being forced to 
change from what our Founding Fathers intended for America. I ask what can 
you and Congress do to stop this afront to all citizens. Thank you and God

City sued: Didn't teach cop Spanish
Attorney seeking over $1 million says officer
who assaulted Hispanic couldn't communicate

An attorney for a Hispanic man who was allegedly knocked to the ground and 
kicked by a police officer is seeking over $1 million dollars for his 
client, arguing that the city's failure to teach law enforcement officers 
"fundamental Spanish" is the reason excessive force was used. 

According to the suit filed in a Hunt County, Texas, district court on 
Wednesday, Jose Lopez was assaulted at a football game in 2004 by a Royse 
City police officer who allegedly knocked him to the ground and kicked him 
in the knee and face while wearing steel-toed boots. 

Dallas attorney Domingo Garcia argues in his filing that the city was 
negligent for not monitoring and training the unnamed officer – 
specifically, for not training him to speak Spanish "in order to properly 
communicate with Spanish-speaking persons." 

Chief Tom Shelton told the Greenville Herald-Banner he was unable to 
discuss the specifics of the alleged incident but that the lawsuit was 
without merit and that he was standing behind the officer. 

"There's really not going to be much to it," he said. "To me, it is pretty 
much a frivolous lawsuit." 

"I feel very confident the officer did everything he was supposed to do 
and he was supported by several witnesses," Shelton added. 

Garcia, a former Texas legislator, ex-mayor pro tem for the city of 
Dallas, and national civil rights chairman for the League of United Latin 
American Citizens, the nation’s oldest Latino civil rights organization, 
has filed a similar suit against the city of Irving, Texas. 

In that suit, Domingo charges that an Irving police officer, who was 
cleared of all charged associated with the pepper-spraying and baton 
beating of Jose Palomino, an illegal alien who refused his orders to lay 
on the ground, was forced to use such tactics because he could not 
communicate in Spanish. 

The plaintiff in the suit said he had been coming to the U.S. to work for 
23 years but did not understand what the officer meant when he repeatedly 
said, "Down! Down! Down!" 

"The officer's defense was that he wasn't trained by the Irving police 
department on how to subdue a suspect without using a baton," Garcia told 
KILF radio talk-show host Greg Knapp. "And second, that the only phrase he 
knew in Spanish was, 'Manos aqui'. 

"That's why Mr. Palomino was subjected to the beating and the macing," he 
said. "A police officer, like any public servant or anybody in the private 
sector, has to cater to the language of the market." 

Garcia called Knapp's use of the term "illegal alien" in reference to his 
client a "racial slur," likening it to "calling people nigger!" 

The suit against Royce City is seeking $1 million in exemplary damages, 
$3,000 in medical expenses, $150,000 in damages for pain and suffering and 
$25,000 for lost wages, as well as an apology from the police officer. 


Sincerely,


Robert DeMarco

Dear Governor
As a native Florida and excellent customer of the Internal Revenue Service, I am writing to ask for your assistance. I have contacted the Department of Homeland Security in an effort to determine the process for becoming an illegal alien and they referred me to you.
My primary reason for wishing to change my status from U.S. Citizen to illegal alien stem from the bill which was recently passed by the Senate and for which you voted. If my understanding of this bill's provisions is accurate, as an illegal alien who has been in the United States for five years, all I need to do to become a citizen is to pay a $2,000 fine and income taxes for three of the last five years. I know a good deal when I see one and I am anxious to get the process started before everyone figures it out.
Simply put, those of us who have been here legally have had to pay taxes every year so I'm excited about the prospect of avoiding two years of taxes in return for paying a $2,000 fine. Is there any way that I can apply to be illegal retroactively? This would yield an excellent result for me and my family because we paid heavy taxes in 2004 and 2005.
Additionally, as an illegal alien I could begin using the local emergency room as my primary health care provider. Once I have stopped paying premiums for medical insurance, my accountant figures I could save almost $10,000 a year.

Another benefit in gaining illegal status would be that my family would receive preferential treatment relative to her school applications, as well as "in-state" tuition rates for many colleges throughout the United States.

Lastly, I understand that illegal status would relieve me of the burden of renewing my driver's license and making those burdensome car insurance premiums. This is very important to me given that I still have children driving my car.

If you would provide me with an outline of the process to become illegal 
(retroactively if possible) and copies of the necessary forms, I would be most appreciative. Thank you for your assistance.

Your Loyal Constituent, James DeLong

Subject:	Good News Story: Exemplary Florida Citizen & LCDR Deserves Recognition for Humanitarian Acts In Afghanistan

Hello Governor Bush, 

 

I think I came across a story yesterday that you’ll want to know about, if you don’t already. Your trips overseas to visit troops are famous, and both your actions and words show you care deeply about the morale and success of our soldiers.  Well, yesterday I came across a good news story about Floridians among our troops in Afghanistan that need our help. 

 

In the past, I have had the good fortune to be able to participate in the Any Soldier program, where members of the general public can support our troops overseas with letters, supplies, and morale boosters.  But, yesterday I learned about humanitarian requests from one our fellow Floridians and a UF grad (go Gators!), LCDR Sheldon A. Chatman.  LCDR Chatman, who is stationed in Khowst, Afghanistan, has given up the opportunity to request creature comforts on the Any Soldier web site for his own troops’ behalf, and instead is using this platform to request supplies that will serve the humanitarian needs of the community around their base.  

 

Although I’ve never met this sailor, his actions are clearly heroic.  His Florida based group of 20 sailors seem to be on the forefront of being able to single-handedly change perceptions of the Afghan people about America.  My staff and I are already putting together some care packages that he requested to help the local children have shoes in time for winter.  

 

But, this sailor deserves recognition by our State, and the citizens of our great State deserve to hear more stories about exemplary Floridians who are making a difference in the world.  What will be more important to him, I believe, is help with three deathly ill Afghan children that were brought to him for medical assistance.  Although I am also contacting friends who are physicians who may be able to suggest some alternatives, I wanted to send email to you as the Governor, who may be able to bring the power of the State to more quickly address the urgent health needs of these three children.  

 

I’ve never written to any of my elected officials, but this is a good reason to start.  IT would be great if you can consider any recognition that you can offer LCDR Sheldon A. Chatman, as an outstanding example of humanitarianism and what being a proud Florida citizen is all about.  

 

Here’s the link to the Any Soldier Site: http://anysoldier.com/WhereToSend/

Search Florida, and you will find the link for: LCDR Sheldon A. Chatman 

 

Very truly yours,
