Goverorer Bush,
      Thank you for responding to my letter so fast. Some one has contacted 
me in Pensacola today. My prayers have been answered. I may not get custody 
of this child this week but I know some one has a heart and cared enough to 
respond. My prayers are with you and your family.

Dear Gov. Bush ...
 
I am so surprised that someone in your office actually  read  my email to you requesting help after Hurricane Frances.  More than that, I am amazed that not only did someone actually read the email, but also acted upon it.  A very, very nice lady named Wendy Spencer from your office has been in contact with me, and she told me she would look into my problem of having no food due to the power outage.  Within one day, I was contacted by an agency called Gulf Coast Community Care ..... an agency for elderly services.  They immediately came to my home and brought three meals until we could get on a meal delivery program which will begin on Monday morning.
 
I have never seen anyone act so quickly to get help to a family in need.  My faith is restored that someone out there really does care.  Having said that, I wish to extend my profound thanks for your help, and the speed with which it came.  I only hope that someday we will be able to extend help to someone in need.  
 
Thank you again.

Dear Governor Bush,
I just want to thank you for opposing the transfer of Guana River land to the St. John's County school board for the erection of a new school. If some people had their way the entire state of Florida would be covered in concrete. Thank GOD some people, including yourself, still care about preserving some of Florida's natural environment.
 
Respectfully,

Thank you for writing to Governor Jeb Bush to express your position on Senate Bill 300 relating to payment for accumulated sick leave for public school employees adopted by the Florida Legislature during their 2004 regular session.  The Governor appreciates having an opportunity to learn of your views.

 

The Governor's staff followed all bills as they moved through the legislative process and continually apprised him of their content, implication and progress.  Please be assured, Governor Bush carefully considered your comments and those of other concerned citizens regarding Senate Bill 300 as he made his decision.

 

You may be interested to know Governor Bush signed Senate Bill 300 into law on June 24, 2004.

 

Again, thank you for taking the time to share your comments with Governor Bush.
