JEB BUSH AND/OR CHARLIE CRIST --

WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE TAX RATES AND THE INSURANCE RATES IN FLORIDA.  AS RETIREES, WE HAVE SEEN LARGE INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE RATES AND NOW WE CAN'T EVEN SELL OUR HOMES TO KEEP FROM FORECLOSURE BECAUSE OF THESE UNFAIR INCREASES.  FLORIDA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH IS IN JEOPARDY.  

INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO DON'T WANT TO INSURE OUR RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS STATE.  NO MORE PICKING AND CHOOSING YOUR PROFIT BASE.

ON IMMIGRATION, NO MORE FREEBIES.  WE ARE TIRED OF SUPPORTING ILLEGALS WHEN WE NEED HELP OURSELVES.   IF WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, THEY WOULD NOT COME.  THEY ALL KNOW HOW TO BILK OUR SYSTEM AND  BLEED TAXPAYER DOLLARS.  

DO SOMETHING FOR THE TAXPAYERS FOR A CHANGE.  WE NEED A BREAK BEFORE WE REBEL AND VOTE EVERYONE OUT OF OFFICE.  WE ARE FED UP,OVER BURDENED AND TIRED OF SUPPORTING EVERYONE ELSE.

Subject:	Out of state owner of Florida property

Dear Governor Bush, or incoming new governor,
My husband and I are New York residents and built a second home in Cape Coral in 1988.  We love it there and love Florida.
We want to know why out of state owners are penalized by paying much much higher property taxes than the residents?
We, and thousands of other unhappy people, in the same situation, put millions of dollars into the state of Florida when we come here for up to 6 months a year.  For the other 6 months we do not use any of Florida's services such as the roads, beaches, parks, garbage pickup, etc. but have to pay for them.  We'd like to know what is the reason and why?  We know of many families in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area who are selling theirs beloved homes to go to other states like Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina so they can enjoy their retiring years without the burden of such tax.  There was an article in the area newspaper (The News Press ) last spring about the situation of these many families having to give up their homes to move because of the tax burden.  We are most probably going to sell our home (which we love to death!)  before the end of 2007.
We would like a response as soon as possible to this email.  Thank You.

Governor Bush, I am an acquaintance of Hank Klein. Recently, I got published in the Sun Sentinel. Please read my letter to the editor below and let me know if politically this could be sent to the right folks in Tallahassee. My idea needs to be calculated economically to see the impact it would have on the insurance pool... but to me it makes sense, especially in light of  the ballooned and wasteful budget increases in local government.
 
 Also, a homeowner would get a Federal income tax deduction for property taxes, which would then go to fund Citizens's insurance for the home. Normally amounts paid for property insurance are not deductible so this idea offers added relief to the homeowner..care of Uncle Sam.
 
Curious as to your thoughts. Happy Holidays.

In the past six years, property taxes have provided a windfall to government agencies throughout the state. 

Yet governments have seen fit to increase those budgets and spend this windfall. At the same time, property insurance has skyrocketed in cost. Between the tax and insurance increases, homeowners are being driven to desperation. 

Every government entity needs to roll back today's budgets to those of six years ago, before the tax windfalls, and adjust for 2 percent to 3 percent annual inflation only. Government should then contribute these tax windfalls into the state's Citizens Property Insurance Corp., so that all Floridians could then obtain insurance at reasonable rates.

Subject:	self insurance

Dear Governor Bush:
     I own a condominium in Key Largo, Florida and like many 
others have faced a significant increase in our maintenance fees due to 
insurance costs paid by our Condo Association.  For example, in 2005 the 
total insurance cost covering our 82 unit condo complex was $62,400.  
The equivalent coverage in 2007 is expected to be $195,800.  Our complex 
is composed of three large buildings constructed of nine inch thick 
concrete.  Many units have hurricane glass or shutters.  The likelihood 
of a hurricane loss as high as $196,000 in any given year is nil.
     We feel that the answer to this situation lies in a self-insurance 
plan but we are being told that State Laws make this impossible.  For 
example, please see this web link:

http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2006/dec/03/rob_samouce_condominium_association_selfinsurance_/

      I respectively request that the State Government of Florida 
consider revisions to its statutes to permit the use of Self-Insurance 
arrangements on a reasonable basis.  I object to paying premiums which 
bear no relation to the risks involved in order to make up for losses in 
other high risk areas.  This problem has become a major negative for 
second home owners like me and as the cost of maintaining a second home
in Florida, I will now start to look outside the state of Florida.  I can no 
longer afford these high costs to maintain a second home.

Dear Governor Bush, 
       Rumor has it that the Seminole's are planning to 4 lane a road from I-75 Alligator Alley straight through the "Big Cypress National Preserve" north for about 14 miles to their new casino that they are planning on building on the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation.  How can they do this and who has the aurthority to allow it on "National Land" that is owned by tax payers of all of America?  They don't even pay taxes....What an outrage!
       Please let me know who I can contact (Federal or Local) to voice my opinions and to find out if this is legal and how I can stop it from happening straight through Florida Panther and Black Bear country.
       I am anticipating your response and help in this matter.

Subject:	Homestead Exemption

Dear Governor Bush:
 
First off, I'd like to thank you for eight years of wonderful service to our State. You have been a great Governor. Next, I'd like to offer my humble suggestion for potentially fixing the property tax problem in Florida. 
 
Currently, each property owner receives a $25,000 homestad exemption. I believe that there are a great many people in our State who are abusing this exemption. They are receiving this exemption based on false or incorrect information. The Florida homestead exemption is available to those owners of property who meet certain criteria. One of those criteria is that the owner of the property continue to reside in that property. As the homestead exemption is automatically renewed each year, the owner receives that homestead exemption each year regardless of whether they actually continue to reside in that property. There is no system of checks and balances to assure that that is correct. How many owners of property who continue to benefit by the homestead exemption have actually rented the property to someone else thereby receiving the benefit of the homestead exemption while, at the same time, receive money from the renters for that property? This seems not only unfair but how much money are the State and counties losing annually due to this? The law is already on the books specifying the criteria of who can receive the homestead exemption but there are no checks to assure that the law is carried out correctly. If the homestead exemption was correctly done each year, there would be countless property owners who would no longer be entitled to that exemption and that would create additional revenue possibly resulting in an overall reduction of assessed value of property taxes or, at the very least, stabilizing property taxes while providing additional revenues annually. Of course, it would create the need for additional resources to monitor this annually, but I would assume that the State's computers already have the information necessary to check and cross reference much of the information required in order to implement a law which is already there. 
 
In my humble opinion, this is one possible solution to a problem that I have yet to see offered. 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Michael Perlman

POINTS/GOALS, WHICH H.A.C. FLORIDA, INC. FEELS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO MAKE MEANINGFUL REDUCTIONS AND CHANGES IN THIS STATE'S HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE.


 

1.  A complete investigation and overhaul of Citizens, by an un-bias, non-political entity. This would include looking into the salaries of executives, bonuses paid out to Citizens employees, while policy holder’s claims from past storms still have not been paid, for example.

2.  Insurance laws in Florida need to be addressed and changed. A complete overhaul of current laws is needed to allow change. Many are archaic and outdated, just adding to the confusion. New laws need to be put in place which do not conflict with the old laws.

3.  Immediate rescission of the 20% rule that Citizens has to charge over any other company. This has only allowed an escalation of rates/premiums. 

4.  All insurance companies doing business in Florida need to be operating under the same rules and guidelines. Startup companies such as Homewise and Florida Peninsula (to name a just a couple) should not be allowed to play outside the rules of other companies, by taking policies from Citizens and charging double the premiums.

5.  Florida only companies should be looked into as to why they are allowed and to who’s benefit.

6.  Insurance companies are a risk business and should be made to accept their risk the same as any other company has to do, without bailouts from individuals and state money.

7.  Should a policy be taken from Citizens by another company, cancelled by Citizens, or just not renewed by the policy holder, the policy holder should be let back into Citizens if they so choose. In the current situation of insurance companies not writing in many areas, policy holders can be left without any insurance and those with mortgages have to cover the property or lose the mortgage, looking at foreclosure.

8.  An independent committee needs to be formed to look into our insurance reform. This committee should be formed of people who are in no way connected to insurance companies, lobbyists, legislators or any people in any way benefiting from insurance profit. The current Reform committee is comprised solely of people “connected”, and cannot be objective. 

9.  Homeowners need to be allowed to choose the amount of coverage they are comfortable with, not mandated to. Homeowners also need to be able to set the value of contents coverage based on their comfort zone of value, not mandated as to one-half the replacement cost of the home.

10. Insurance companies need to lower their risk exposure. One way is stated in   item nine. There are others.

11. There needs to be clear and concise definitions of “sinkhole”, “flood vs. wind/rain” and other catastrophes, so everyone is “on the same page” and there are no ongoing disputes as to who pays out what. Clearly definitions would put blame where it belongs and avoid litigation and the consumer suffering through the process. Sinkhole claims must be “actual” and not just paid off to get rid of the claimant, the number of “actual” sinkholes needs to be clarified – again, a clear definition is needed. A very complex situations which needs to be addressed.

12.  The so called “subsidized” premiums must stop for homes in high risk areas. The three million dollar home on Miami’s waterfront, should not pay less then the $150,000 home in another county. Equality across the board is needed.

13. “Cherry-picking” policies has to stop. If a company is to write policies in Florida, they must take all or nothing, not choose only the lucrative areas for a higher profit and lower risk.

14. Florida should look into what other states, such as Pennsylvania and California have done. One example being: If you sell insurance in the state, you must sell to all and all forms of insurance offered.

15. Older homes should not be penalized because of their age. Upgrades to these homes should allow for substantial decreases in premiums, not a token reduction as has been the case. 

16. Homeowners rates should not be connected to their credit rating in any way.

17. All of Citizens and all insurance company records should be open to the public and easily obtainable.

18. A consumer advocate should be involved in the process of reviewing rate hikes, by all insurance carriers. The current Consumer Advocate is under the direction of the CFO, this creates a conflict of interest. A consumer advocate from the lower and middle class, not connected in any way to big money.

19. We are told that Mississippi offsets its catastrophic loss from casino revenue. We should seriously look into allowing casinos in Florida, to do the same. Instead of allowing gambling boats offshore and losing out on the taxes while others get rich. Another consideration would be a separate Hurricane Lotto.

20. We need to stop building in sensitive and high risk areas. These barriers are one of our first lines of defense against storm surge. Anyone choosing to build there should pay appropriate premiums or be self insured. High risk areas should not be subsidized by the rest of the state. 

21. Older homes should be grandfathered in and insured without penalty. Penalizing them because they are old is unfair.

22. Florida law states that no policy can be cancelled except for non-payment. So, insurance companies call it “non-renewal” to get around the law. Policies must be renewable and remain with the original insurer unless for non-payment, ONLY.

23. Citizens and any other insurer should not make others pay for their losses. Every homeowner and taxpayer is paying to keep Citizens in business, no matter what insurance company they have. That is like paying twice for the same thing and paying for others mistakes.

24. Citizens must work for the policyholder, as it was designed to do, not spend money hiring attorneys, and all, to fight against the government and people it was designed to help.

25. When rates are lowered in specific areas, such as Monroe County, the rest of the state should not have to “pick up the slack” as stated by representatives of Citizens Insurance.

26. Politicians and people from the insurance industry should stop proposing “band-aid” fixes and concentrate a real fix of this problem. Stop throwing state money away in schemes to appease the people who can see through most of the schemes anyway. The ‘matching grant’ program is one example – people who cannot afford insurance in the first place, can’t afford to spend upgrade money either. Loans to pay insurance still makes the homeowner the target.

27. Those with the power to act, need to look at the “trickle down” effect of all this. The whole state is going to feel the “trickle down”, some already and some in the future, but the whole economy of this state is going to suffer.

28. Look into the “take-out” program where other insurance companies are allowed to take Citizens policies and then charge almost double, and get paid a bonus if they keep them for three years. Why should Citizens pay a bonus to these companies? Why should they be allowed to charge double? If “cancelled” where do the people go, they can’t go back to Citizens.

29. The Speed to Market initiative that allows insurance companies to raise rates without requiring normal rate approval must be changed. 

30. Re-insurance is big business. Some insurers have created Florida only companies and buy their re-insurance from the parent company reducing risk and making large profits because of it. Re-insurance needs to be looked into, as it adds greatly to the cost of insurance to the taxpayer.

31. Stop “give-away” programs that benefit the rich and do not help those who cannot afford insurance in the first place, such as the matching grants program. The little guy cannot afford to upgrade when they can’t afford insurance to begin with. Even if they could, the return on lowered premiums is negligible – the program only benefits those with money. Loans to pay insurance premiums only add to the consumer’s burden and programs to give one-thousand dollars to offset premiums doesn’t give relief for those who’s premiums have gone up five-hundred percent. Plus, the thousand dollars comes out of taxpayers money to begin with. The consumers are being hit every time they turn around, not the insurance companies. Insurance companies still post high profits every year.

32. The citizens of Florida should not shoulder the burden of risk. Insurance companies are in the risk business, let them accept their risk.

33. Sinkhole claims must require a permit so that adequate record counts of actual sinkholes can be kept. Instead of adding all, good or bad, to the count.

 

We would be willing to discuss any and all of this with anyone concerned.

Subject:	How is it that Florida Lotter Contributes to our schools?

Florida schools are some of the worst in the us and that's before your time in office so I am NOT faulting you with that.
I am a HUGE Bush dynasty supporter ALL THE WAY.  I have done some asking around and have found that .42 cents on the
dollar is given to the superintendants and the buck primarily stops in that office and never makes it to the actual school level.
Also, that .42 cents is reported to be taken back in other charges later in the year to the school system.
 
This information was verified by numerous state employees I've spoken with all who deal with the Superintendant's offices and the school board as well.  My wife is a teacher's aide and I know many actual full teachers as well.  How is it then that one of the HIGHEST jackpots in the US alongside Caly winds up being in the same state as one of the worst rated school systems then? 
 
It's either Wyoming or Wisconsin, one of those W states that actually does NOT claim to give to Education.  I'd be more comfortable if 
that were the case.  I work at a gas station and I feel bad for people who lose and say they at least feel good because they honestly BELIEVE that it goes to education.... I don't have the heart to tell them what I've heard and that's because I've not researched it FULLY but I have a LOT of STRANGERS in agreement, all who work on the school board. 
 
I live in Alachua County.
 
Once again, this is not reflecting on YOU as gov'nr because I absolutly LOVE the Bush Admin in all its varients.
 
Please... can we find a way to either GET the money to education so we wont be lying, or can we stop telling anyone that it goes to Education when it apparently is only less than half on the dollar and that even gets recharged again according to 8 out of 10 school board members and affiliates of the supers. 
 
Happy new year and marry Christmas...
Alvin Lester Boyett.

Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001 

Dear Governor:

I am writing this letter to you, as I am a homeowner in the State of Florida.  I have lived here for the past 21 years.  

I want to express my concerns about what is happening with our state, as no one else will.  It seems as though people are afraid to open their mouths.  Well, I think that it is time and that I need to.

I am very worried that the real estate taxes in this state are going to outrageously high.  My homeowner's insurance was just raised $2,000.00 for the year 2007.  To me this is rediculous.  It's highway robbery.  

The State of Florida MUST do something about the insurance rates for its residents.  

Also, the property taxes in our state are going too high for people by property.

What is happening is that IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, OUR PROPERTY IS GOING TO BE WORTHLESS.  

YOU MUST DO SOMETHING to protect the people in our State.

My husband and I worked very hard for what we have, and we are not willing to loose it because the state is not protecting its residents.  I am not only concerned for us, but for every resident in the state.

I IMPLORE YOU TO PLEASE DO SOMETHING and not to let this happen to us.

Very truly yours,

Bonnie Cordier

I applaud Governor Bush's promotion of the use of biofuels for 
American use. May I ask why he also does not also promote the removal 
of sugar tarrifs? Biofuels can be made much cheaper from sugar rather 
than corn. The high tarrifs on sugar keep that from happening. With 
cheaper biofuels the use of this energy source would go up 
exponentially. So Governor Bush please enlighten me. Gerard Marder, Miami, FL.

I heard that my local government in Sarasota County is going to attempt to circumvent the Florida home stead exemption in order to raise our property taxes more than currently allowed.  If this is true, then many residents will have to sell their homes and move out of Florida. This plan can not come to light. Their are many retiree's and people like myself that barely get by as it is.

To Whom it may concern:
   My name is Jackie Mancini and I am a teacher as well as mother of 4.  As is, we are hardly surviving with the salary I make.  My children have to be on my insurance which consumes a large portion of my paycheck every pay period.  Every paycheck is "spoken" for with bills,  groceries, insurance, utilities, school loans, and daycare.  There are literally no extras.  My monthly bills come to approximately $1950.00, not including gas, insurance or things that come up during the month (medicines, etc...), my take home pay is approximately $2000.00.  No joke!  I live in a very small house and drive an older car so one can't even say that other "material" things take up my paycheck.  You're proposal to take away our paychecks this summer will devastate my household!  There is no way we will be able to survive or even re-cover from such a loss of funds.  I beg of you to re-consider and find another way to do things.  
  I have a passion for teaching.  It's what I've always wanted to do.  I'm finding out, however that maybe teaching can't be what I retire from.  With the rising costs of living day to day and having to support a family, I can't survive on a teachers salary.  Teachers get no respect from the community, the media and now our government!  I wish those who find it so easy to take things away from us or criticize us would walk just one day in our shoes.
  Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.  In all honesty, peoples lives are at stake here.  We can't afford to be without a paycheck.
  Sincerely,

 I came up with a seemingly brillant idea to solve the insurance crisis here in Florida. The State Employee Retirement Fund, has biliions of dollars invested in stocks and bonds. Why not create an insurance company with these funds, with the premiums placed back in the fund, to cover Floridians insurance needs? Even with the pay outs of storms past, these companies made very good profits. How better to insure positive returns, than to invest these funds into a sure fire profit generator? If nothing else a proposal such as this would; surely cause these companies to make needed changes in their own insurance plans.

Subject:	Insurance Rates and taxes in Florida...

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
 
When is this going to STOP?!  
 
I just received notice that my Homeowners Insurance is going to increase over 70% percent this coming year!!!!  The newspapers said they were allowed an 8 - 33% percent increase.  That was bad enough. But, Jeb, not everyone has the money of the "Bushes"...  Not all people in this State are millionaires.  The "News" says only 1 out of 6 people here are millionaires....or will be, soon.  What about us 5 out of 6% "MAJORITY" that are in the middle to low income brackets..  
 
A resident of Florida for over 33 years, I recently, retired, due to my health and am trying to survive on a small fixed income and find it impossible to live here and pay the cost of Homeowner's Insurance.  It has been said that my home "TAXES" are expected to raise tremendously, too, next year!!  E-gads, ... 
 
Again, I ask, .... when will this end?  There is an exodus started that will leave Florida to, only, the extremely rich!  This was not the intentions of Roosevelt, Eisenhower or even the Kennedy's..  Certainly, not the intentions of Roosevelt that began this whole social security plan...
 
Do I need to find a small, rural, third world country to live out my days before I am too old to even make a move?  This is a question many, many, many of my friends are asking.....
 
Or, could you and your brother get down to earth a little and take care of us at home base?  Before, we all leave home....  
 
I realize it is a great distance to communicate to the upper echelon that rules but I must, at least, try.  I hope this request gets read, seen and understood by your clear eyes... and not just a Page that returns a form letter of thanks for your interest in Florida.
 
Thank you,

Subject:	Legacy

 I've been reading several stories this week in the Miami Herald about your time as our governor and the legacy I believe you will be most remembered for is the insurance crisis. The lack of action by you and the legislatures who have had their hands out to the lobbyist while we've had ours slapped. 
 
 I am an Allstate customer who was "randomly" selected to have their policy canceled when it expires in May.  My complaints about Allstate to the various politicians have fallen on deaf ears. I read today how Allstate just got approved for an 8% rate hike. I would gladly take that compared to what I fear will happen in May. This will be less money for me to spend on Florida's economy. Can't you people see that? That means less sales tax revenue. I have watched while my leaders have let this happen and won't take a tough stance. Why can't these companies who have pulled a Democrat by cutting and running, be suspended from writing any other types of policies in this state until they make things right? I have read how you oppose gambling and now we stand to get nothing from the Seminoles. This is money that could've been placed into a catastrophe fund, perhaps solve all the problems with Citizens Insurance and help lower our rates again.
 
 Because of my state government leaders, I am done. I am eligible now to retire but am in a DROP plan and am going to tough it out for another 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years max before I leave the state. That is for certain. Just as 3/4ths of the people I know who have worked with me and retired. The dream of living in Florida is no longer a reality. I still have young kids and thanks to the education system, I will not put my daughter in a Broward County Middle School.  I have watched how over the years, a "white flight" has taken place in this county.  I am not going to watch it happen again and after recently visiting several states and checking out the cost of living in them, made the decision on moving to New Hampshire, where I went to high school. No sales tax or income taxes and a better educational system. One thing I've learned about Florida is if it's run by a county government, it's going to be screwed up. I used to consider taxes as being high in that state but when you take look at what I am now paying for homeowners insurance and what I would be paying for property taxes if I move elsewhere in this state along with the sales taxes, Florida becomes more expensive to live than N.H.
 
 It didn't used to be that way. It happened on your watch and that's going to be your going to be remembered for. Retiree's are no longer moving here in the volume they once were. What a shame. You can see what's happening in South Florida and how it'll start spreading to the rest of the state. Thank god I'll be long gone. I shames me to feel this way about you because I am a Republican and have strong support for your brother but if you ever run for national office where I have a chance to vote, it won't be for you.

Subject:	Gov. Christ and home owners insurance session

Hello

I am writing to the Jeb Bush office hoping to contact the Charles Christ 
staff about the property insurance issue and legislative session to come 
next year.

If you can help see that the new Governors staff gets this I would 
appreciate it.

Without changes to coastal development rules and regulations the state 
will not be able to solve, long term, the insurance issue.

I heard Governor Bush say that there there is no quick solution to this 
and he is right.

Future coastal development needs to be treated in a different manner 
than it has.

In the 1970s there was a resort built over here in Northeast Florida 
called Amelia Island. It was placed behind what is called the primary 
dunes rather than right on the beach. This is not a big deal, nothing 
radical except that if all coastal development had been done that way 
since the 1970s the insurance crisis would be less than it is now by far.

Just building back a ways behind the dunes for new development could 
protect the state from minor storms and lessen the impact of major ones.

It is a shame that a series of Governors and legislatures have really 
done little or nothing to address this simple partial remedy.

I think that in a way without this simple reform of not allowing 
building directly on the beach for new projects that there is no sign of 
a serious dedication to doing the job in the long term. Without this 
change the political talk is just talk.

I know it would be a big change but nothing else will serve to begin to 
off set the insurance risks to property that beach development poses . 
This is setting aside other risks such as the cost of beach 
re-nourishment and emergency services.

Whatever is there on the coast now would have to be grandfathered in, 
but new development has to be treated differently now. If we do not 
start now, the long term situation will never change. Toying around with 
rates and formulas in this year or the next is not a fundamental change 
that should have been made decades ago.

Anyway thanks

Re: Library Building Grant for Dundee

 

Dear Sirs and Madams:

 

I moved to the Town of Dundee during the spring of 2001 and since then have been a library patron. My whole family (3 kids and a wife) and me benefit of having such a library in town. We don’t own a computer since we can’t afford to pay for the Internet connection, so my kids, often go to the library to do special school projects, homework, or just to use the computers and check out books for the fun of it. My wife loves to read and also to stay connected with her far away family via online. I mostly like to checkout movies on its various formats. Since the 2004 hurricane season the library has moved twice. The library collection is now looking for a permanent home and without this grant the. Many families benefit from the many services this library has to offer and it will be a shame to loose this asset for the entire community, only you can help us save our library!

 

Please help us save our library;

Dear Governor Bush:  
Please do not allow portability to be introduced as a fair ingredient in real property tax reform.   This will only further promote the inequitable taxation caused by the Save Our Homes legislation.  Without portability moving to a more expensive home brings property values more in line with other taxpayers.  The most important aspect of property tax reform must be equal valuations of like property.
 
Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:	Property taxes for newcomers to FL

I near fell over when I found out that if a bought a house for 
$250-300,000 in Palm Beach County that I would be paying over $6000 in 
property taxes.  I currently own a home in another state and due to 
health problems (athritis) need to move to a warmer climate.  I am not 
sixty five and would not receive an additional $25,000 exemption.

Although I live in a state with income tax, we do not have sales tax and 
do not pay tolls on roads (Oregon).  I am not sure how property taxes 
are assessed here exactly, but it is not strictly a percentage of what 
you paid (Palm Beach County 2.2% of amount sold for is what I was 
told).  I have learned from a relative who bought a house 5 or 6 years 
ago for $150,000 that he pays less than half of what his neighbor pays, 
because the neighbor paid $300K.  If everyone's property is more or less 
the same why are they not assessed something in between?

We all know that property values are rising everywhere.  But shouldn't 
taxes be based upon values?  Where I live houses are selling for 
anywhere from 375-400,000. They are assessed at about 65%. Then they are 
charged 1-1.10% Whether you live here 20 years or 3 years we all pay 
within $600 of each other beacause our values are being looked at (taxes 
are 2200-2900 on a 50x100 lot.......the higher amount is assessed if you 
have done upgrades).  By doing this the tax based is shared, "new home 
buyers" and those relocating can purchase.  I get the impression from a 
Florida realtor that school teachers and other hard working people 
cannot afford to purchase due to the property taxes.

It seems like the very well off can afford this, and newcomers or first 
time buyers are forced into manufactured home communities; not very safe 
or cost efficient in a state with hurricanes.

It seems like the millage rates are disproportionate to the median 
income purchaser.  In Oregon, higher income people pay higer state 
income tax.  Perhaps there should be a graduated millage rate based upon 
incomes and/or property values; that would then take into consideration 
your retirees or those on a fixed budget.  Those who can afford more 
expensive homes might not be so effected and they usually are not buying 
less expensive homes say under $300,000.

While i an not an economist in making these comments and suggestions I 
hope I have at least helped you realize the seriousness of this issue 
from someone interested in living in your state.

There is no other place like it on the planet.  If development keeps encroaching upon it, I'm afraid that the plants and animals that call it home will be forced out and the ecosystem will eventually disappear.

There's more to Florida than development and making room for more people to move into an already over crowded area.  Please vote no on the FPL complex and help save a very important part of Florida.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
    I read the Bradenton Herald this morning the article about the Property Taxes vs. the Sales Tax increase to 13.5 % is probably the most ridicules proposal I have ever heard of.  I really liked you has a Governor but I sure hope you don't run for President if you come up with ideas like this.  The State of Florida is getting more property tax dollars now then they have ever gotten and the Herald printed in the summer sometime that they had an abundance of Tax money from Property.  Then our taxes went up anyway.  You have all these new homes that are being build and they are paying $8000 and more for taxes.  And that is not counting the homes on the East Coast or Gulf.  What in the world do you think us retired people are going to do that are on fixed incomes.  The Insurance rates alone are chasing us out and now you want to put the Sales Tax up to 13.5%.  I don't know of another State that is that high.  And we won't be able to deduct that from our Federal Taxes.  Because who is going to keep track of all the Sales tax that we spend at the Grocery Store and small items.  As you can tell I am very upset about this Article.  The State of Florida is getting in more money then they ever had and you want more. And where is it going?   Is this the way you want to leave office.  You need to lower the taxes and make do.  We as retired people have too.  Every year everything keeps going up and our income is fixed.  I thought you were a good man and would try to fix this.  Apparently I was wrong you, you are leaving this state worse than when you came in.  You are not leaving office in good standing.  
 
    Another thing is the halt on the executions.  What do you think of the victims and there families.  Were they showed any mercy?  Nobody cares if it took 34 minutes for the person to die.  Most people don't think it should have taken 27 years to be put to death.  There should be a reasonably  amount of time for appeals but not 27 years.   I believe in God and that people should be giving a fair amount of time to make peace with the Lord but not 27 years.  And I would bet most of the victims suffered more than 34 minutes and it doesn't sound like he suffered, just lingered on a little.  Most people with Terminal Cancer would like that kind of death.  It took my mother 4 years of dying of cancer and you know what/ she didn't complain once. And believe me she suffered.  She did not suffer 34 minutes she suffer 4 years. 
 
    I truly think you need to get your priorities changed and help the fixed income people and leave the executions alone.  You might not like what I have to say but I thought of you as a good moral man and you are going out of office as a total idiot.  And that is my opinion so I don't think you can sue me for that.  I will not call you an idiot to anybody else but I can say I am not happy with the way you are treating the Florida residents.  You need to help fix things.  I am just wondering what in the world are you doing with all the money you are getting from all these new homes.  My neighbor moved 3 blocks away and because his house is about $200,000 more and new his taxes went from $2400 to $9300.  If we could sell our homes most of us would move to Tenn. or Kentucky.  I guess you need to talk to the Governors there to see how they are managing to pay for schools and roads and run there States.  On a house bigger than mine the taxes are $800 and about 18 years newer.  Go figure.    
 
    God Bless you and I sure hope you come to your sences.  I would hate to see you leave in January with this hanging over your head.  I just wonder what state you are moving too and what there Tax rate is?

   Property taxes will never go down cause there is a need for money, and the bils got to be paid !!!
   Where do you find this revenue? Not from property taxes, there already too high, and could kill the golden goose of retirees coming here !!!
   1) Start an income tax !!!
   2) Allow gambling wherever its voted in, and instead of higher property taxes, most communities will vote it in !!!
   3) Change the veteran's disability total property tax exemption to only totally disabled, and with income requirements that non-veterans have to meet. Enough already with millionare disabled vets. paying no taxes !!!
   Forget about raising the homestead exemption cause all the counties will do is raise the assessments !!! If they need the money, their going to get it, one way or another !!!
   We had this problem of not enough revenue, not because of too much growth, but because of too little!! Ct. allowed casino gambling, along with starting an income tax, and people did yell for awhile, but it all settled down.The housing market rebounded after 5 yrs of a 40% drop to be ahead after 8 yrs. But this wouldn't have happened without the revenue coming from different areas like gambling, and income taxes!!!

Governor Bush, Just another note on the high out of control property taxes. Sure something has to be done but whatever it is may not be the total answer. What I am going to refer to is the "hidden" taxes by many cities.

I live Clearwater. If you put a cap on property taxes the City can get all the revenue it wants from several different sources. At present there is a 13% tax on our electric bills listed as Municipal Franchise Fee and City utility tax. Of course as the price of oil goes up so does our electric bill and so does the taxes to the City. Then there is a 10% tax on our water bill along with a $10 per month storm water improvement fee. There is also a 7% City tax on our phone bill. This is not to mention garbage collection fees, recycling fees, parking meter charges, recreational fees for use of City owned facilities. And the list can go on. All the City Government has to do is quietly raise these fees and collect more revenue.

I am very fortunate that I have a very comfortable tax cap on my home. I figure I pay more to the City of Clearwater in fees and utility taxes then I do in property taxes. I am on my private campaign to inform every on I know of these taxes and fees imposed by our local government. I wasn't aware of these until just recently and I find many many people are also not aware of them. They as so many of us just look to see how much the bills are and just pay them without realizing what is going on.

It seems clear that the reason property tax in Florida is so high is that rich developers want land to build condos, etc. and increase their wealth. Since they have so much money they can drive up the price of land and therefore the tax on the land increases accordingly. So it seems that the obvious solution to the  problem is to have 2 tax rates. One would be for the people who live on the land as their home and the other wold be for those who buy land for investment or business purposes. The first rate could be kept within reasonable limits and the state could still get the money needed from the second. If such ridiculous things as doubling the sales tax are put into effect I suspect tourism would fall flat on its face.

Subject:	A Concerned Taxpayer

Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
I am concerned about property taxes and how the proceeds of these taxes are distributed to the masses. in Apr 94 I bought a modest home for $100,462.  Over the years I made improvements and the house appreciated in value. Today it is one of the larger homes in the neighborhood.  My insurance company tell me the replacement value is $214,000 and smaller homes on the street have sold for $136,000 to $259,900.  
 
My wife and I have no children. I use 11.4 miles of roads each day to go to work and most of beach blvd is a construction mess. I have health insurance. I do not use the public library, schools, jails, courthouses or city hall. 
 
On the other end of town there is a small home with a single mother raising 3 kids. Her cheaper or chapter 8 house is worth 1/3 of my house and yet I pay more taxes to educate her children, some of which use drugs, kill people and drop out of school. Where is the fairness to this system?  Why should a family who practiced responsible sex pay for the children of a single mother who screwed any male in sight before he went to jail for shooting someone and had her children out of wedlock?  Which of you elected officials will answer me in writing? Why are middle class homes held hostage to educate the ungrateful underclass?
 
 Crime from the underclass is becoming more violent and seems to be spreading to better neighborhoods. Just last month someone stole my neighbor's car and my mother-in-law was pick pocked in Walmarts. City wide 134 homicides have taken place this year.  Why aren't we using tax money to increase police protection, hire more prosecutors and build more community based jails? 
 
Last year my escrow account was $750 short because my home owner's insurance went up, even though I live in Jacksonville where no hurricane has struck since 1964.  What's up with home owner's insurance? 
 
Mr. Clark You are my city council member. Would you care to give me a lesson in civics? Mr. Mayor I voted for you. Care to try an answer?  Jeb, soon you will be a condo owner, will you fly Old Glory on the common property?  Gov elect Crist, you represent hope in Florida. Care to try an answer? 
 
Merry Christmas,

Subject:	Legal Scalping of tickets

Dear Governor Bush,
  I know that this is late in your term to bring up an issue that has bothered me for quite some time, but please
review the rest of my e-mail and if you feel it is appropriate, pass it along to your successor.
  My wife and I are average citizens who like to attend both sporting and cultural events. There is a law in Florida that prohibits
individuals from re-selling any event ticket for more than the retail price of the ticket(scalping). However, "ticket brokers"
are allowed to do exactly that for any price they can get. This law has allowed this business to flourish. In doing so, it has also
locked out most individuals from enjoying many events as ticket brokers will pay people to snap up as many tickets as they can 
to any event. 
  A prime example of this is the future performance of "Wicked" at the new Carnival center in Miami. My wife and I 
are not season ticket holders but wanted to attend this play. We went online as soon as the tickets were available to the public
but the only seats available were the 4th tier which is way up in the theater. On a lark, I decided to check with several ticket brokers 
for these tickets. Every single ticket broker I spoke to had tickets in all sections but of course at a premium. An example of the
scalping that takes place is that I was quoted a price of $400.00 for a ticket that has a retail value of $150.00.
  These brokers no longer rely on individuals to sell them tickets they have purchased but can no longer use as may have occurred 
the past, they are now paying individuals to purchase tickets strictly for them to re-sell. This is killing the opportunity for individuals such
as my wife and I to attend single events that we would like to unless we purchase season tickets or buy them at a significant premium from
a ticket broker.. 
  I know if I buy season tickets, I can always re-sell my tickets to these brokers, but I refuse to do so.

Governor Bush,

 

First I wanted to thank you for being supportive of teachers in Florida during your tenure and also commend you for your expediency and efficiency in handling Florida's hurricane emergencies in the past.  I have been a Florida resident and Brevard County high school teacher of English for the past 7 years.  I just found out that teachers are going to experience a 3 week pay gap in August 2007 due to a legislatively mandated change to the school calendar.

 

I am concerned about where the extra money is going to come from to personally deal with this crisis due to already high home insurance costs, rising property taxes, and cost of living increases.  I am a 32 year old father of 1 with a wife who teaches as well and we are already in a pinch when it comes to our salaries covering our bills, especially considering the current insurance crisis.

 

I ask that you please forward this e-mail to members of your staff and Gov. Elect Crist and his staff because this is going to be a real concern for thousands of Florida's teachers.  It is not too late for you to step in and add this important item to Florida's agenda for 2007.

 

Thank you for your time and good luck with all of your future endeavors.

 

Sincerely.

Attachments:	hatecrimes_bwNEW.pdf

To Whom It May Concern:
 
My name is Marie Baker. I am a senior at the University of Tampa. It has recently been brought to my attention that people are paying homeless people to do gruesome things to themselves and other homeless people. These horrible acts are filmed and then distributed for sale!  Hate crimes and violence against the homeless is rising. I know that Florida has a large population of homeless so this is definitely a pressing issue. So far, California and Maine are the only two states to pass legislation regarding violence against the homeless being classified as a hate crime. I understand that a Bill was brought forth discussing this very topic, but died as a result of the Legislature’s session ending. I hope that you will be able to help not only me, but the entire homeless community!
 
I contacted the National Homeless Organization and they provided me with a model of what the state legislation might look like: 
 
Whereas, hate crimes and violence against homeless persons has become a nationwide epidemic, with 472 reported cases of violence against homeless people over the past 7 years, resulting in 169 deaths;
 
Whereas, the scope of prohibitions against the commission of hate crimes against certain groups of persons should include homeless persons;
 
Whereas, understanding violent crimes committed against homeless persons and adequate punishment for such crimes play key roles in preventing and managing violence against homeless persons; and
 
Whereas, law enforcement needs proper training to handle and prevent violent crimes against homeless persons; 
 
Be it enacted:
 
(1)               Definition of Homeless Person – For purposes of this section, "homeless person" refers to an individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, or an individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is:


(a) A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, including cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings; 

(b) A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations, including motels, hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing; or


(c) Housing of other persons in which the individual is temporarily staying due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason.
 
(2)               The state hate crimes statute shall be expanded to include homeless persons as 
a protected class.
 
(3)               Prohibition on Hate Crimes against Homeless Persons – The following acts shall be deemed a hate crime and prohibited when carried out against a person on the basis that person’s status as a homeless person:
 
(a)    Assault, aggravated assault, battery, or aggravated battery upon the person; or
 
(b)   Acts that deface, damage, or destroy or attempt to deface, damage, or destroy the personal property of the person; or
 
(c)    Acts that result in the death of the person; or 
 
(d)   Any other crime against the person.
 
(4)               Punishments for Hate Crimes again Homeless Persons – 
 
(a)    A person convicted of aggravated assault or aggravated battery upon a homeless person based on the victim’s status as a homeless person shall be sentenced to a minimum term of 3 years and fined not more than $10,000.  The person shall be ordered by the sentencing judge to make any restitution to the victim of the offense and to perform 500 hours of community service work.  Restitution and community service work shall be in addition to any fine or sentence that may be imposed and shall not be in lieu thereof.
 
(b)   Whenever a person is charged with committing an assault or aggravated assault or a battery or aggravated battery upon a homeless person based on the victim’s status as a homeless person, the offense for which the person is charged shall be reclassified as follows:
 
(i)                  In the case of aggravated battery, from a felony of the second degree to a felony of the first degree.
 
(ii)                In the case of aggravated assault, from a felony of the third degree to a felony of the second degree.
 
(iii)               In the case of battery, from a misdemeanor of the first degree to a felony of the third degree.
 
(iv)              In the case of assault, from a misdemeanor of the second degree to a misdemeanor of the first degree.
 
(5)               State Office of the Attorney General Study -  
 
(a)    The Office of the Attorney General shall assess the extent of the problem of crimes against homeless persons and develop a plan to prevent these crimes and apprehend and prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes.
 
(b)   In developing the assessment and plan, the Office of the Attorney General shall consult homeless persons, service providers and advocates for homeless persons, and law enforcement agencies with experience investigating crimes against homeless persons.
 
(6)               Law Enforcement Training on Hate Crimes against Homeless Persons – 
 
(a)    The lead state law enforcement agency shall develop a telecourse that shall be made available to all law enforcement agencies in the state.

The telecourse shall address crimes against homeless persons and methods of dealing effectively and humanely with homeless persons.  The course shall include instruction on each of the following topics:
 
(i)                  Information about homelessness, including causes of homelessness, its impact, and solutions to homelessness.

(iii)               The impact of these crimes on the victim, the victim’s family, and the community.
 
(iv)              The assistance and compensation available to victims.

(vi)              Law enforcement procedures, reporting, and documentation of hate crimes.
 
(vii)             Techniques and methods to handle incidents of hate crimes.

(iii)               Providing victim assistance and follow up, including community follow up.
 
(iv)              Reporting methods and procedures to track hate crimes against homeless persons.

Subject:	Moneys for court appointed counsel

 It is my understanding that Governor Bush is not willing to release funds early in January unless the compensation paid to court-appointed attorneys is reduced to save money.  Does the govenor really believe that the amounts paid to court-appointed counsel is too high?  Is it unreasonable that I received $1000.00 for a felony case that took me about 20 hours to complete?  That is $50 per hour.  I will receive $2500.00 on a felony case punishable by life in prison  (attempted first degree murder).  That type of case will probably take about 30 to 40 hours of work if it doesn't go to trial.  That is an average of $60 to $80 per hour.  If I got to trial that means another $500 dollars and approximately 15 hours more of work.  That would be $3000 for 45 to 55 hours.  That is about $55 to $65 per hour to represent a man who could spend the rest of his life in prison.  Is that too high? 
 
 
I wonder how much Governor Bush believes is appropriate for an attorney, who is qualified to handle these types of cases, deserves to be paid.  When his daughter was arrested I am sure that he believed her attorney deserved to be paid a reasonable amount.  Why does he show such disrespect for those who are willing to work at an already significantly reduced fee?
 
I realize that it is not popular to help "criminals" but to further cut the compensation to court-appointed attorneys will only lower the quality of those willing to help the indigent.  Is that Governor Bush's plan?  
 
Please explain why I deserve less for my work. 
 
Thank you.

Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush, 

You and your staff may or may not be aware of what's transpiring at the Federal level with FDA's effort to establish a national PDMA regulation.  For this reason I am forwarding the challenge being place before the courts, in an effort to bring some semblance of rationality to the PDMA regulations which have been proposed and were to be implemented December 1st, of this year, by the F.D.A. 

There's no question for a means to control the distribution of pharmaceuticals.  However, what you signed into law and what the incoming governor was in favor of, has placed a sever hardship on the smaller, secondary drug wholesalers.  These firms have been licensed and have honorably and ethically served the medical practitioners and institutions for years.  We have been placed in  disadvantageous competitive situation with the primary major drug wholesalers. 

As an example, McKesson, has stopped shipping into Florida, because of the Pedigree requirements.  Yet, their subsidiary, General Medical, has salesmen in Florida, competing against us and have product to sell.  Amerisource-Bergin, as of December 1st, has begun charging $5,000 per month from each of the secondary wholesalers who purchase from them, purpose of which they state, is to cover their added administrative and IT costs.  (With an estimated twenty (2) such secondary wholesale companies purchasing from them, equates to collecting $100K/month or $1.2M/year.  How is one to sustain themselves in business with legislation which tips the field unfavorably toward such a market???  This is not creating a free and open market where a business can compete based on the merit of its service, quality, or delivering a new a better widget. 

As a lifelong Republican, I sent my financial support to Charlie Crist, and after I read where he was in favor of this legislation, I wish I had not. 

A second e-mail is forthcoming without editorializing but will give you added insight into what RxUSA is legally doing to thwart the implementation by the F.D.A. of a national PDMA regulation. 

Respectfully yours,

Dear Gov Bush,
                        Since you have been our Governor, I am proud of the things you have done for our kids and their future developement. But I need an explanation for why Florida is being taken away from us by Developers that are taking land that should be preserved for future generations. Beaches that were public are now becoming private. Woodlands and trails that are being taken away. I grew up in Seminole County Florida and enjoyed the woods and lakes. now the woods are gone and the lakes polluted. Just a few years ago, Lake County had pristine lakes. Now they are polluted and nasty. One of the best views in Florida is now being taken away from us in Lake County. By developers. where does this end? In the loss of the Ocala Forest? No nature trails or habitats for the animals and birds? I am a Republican Conservative and want to support your future as President of the United States, someday. But I need to know if you will do more for conservation and what you have done for the same the last few years as Governor of Florida. I have a high regard and repect for you. I also am concerned about what happens toFlorida in the future. thank you, Ron Eldridge. Tavares Florida

the state of FL that will cover me. The cost of this
renewal is $4600. All of these fees are due 1-3-06. on
top of that I have to pay a $2500 mortgage.

Subject:	Special Session on Home insurance rate increases

Governor Bush,
 
My name is Jackie Fleener and I reside in Merritt Island. I received my STATE FARM 2006-2007 Homeowners policy Friday, Dec. 9 and was shocked to see that my premium had increased
308%. I understand that there is a special session in the upcoming weeks concerning home insurance rates. I am but one of many people in this state who is very frustrated and angry right now. I just want my voice to be heard.
My STATE FARM agent stated "yes that 308% is high, but the 75-90% advertised rate increase was just an average". Maybe that explanation would work on some people but it isn't going to fly with me. This is not acceptable. No one can afford this type of increase, I certainly cannot. I am retired and living on a limited income and my homeowner's bill of $4240.55(with discount of $852 for claim-free). 
I asked my agent what happens next year if we have hurricanes? I suspect that STATE FARM would ask for and would probably be granted another rate increase. And would my premium go up another 300%? If that happens, I will have to sell my house as I will not have the money to pay the premiums. 
And what happens if I have a claim? Will my insurance be dropped as several of my friends have been? Will STATE FARM try to not pay claim because the claim doesn't fall under their "hurricane coverage" which has happened to one of my friends -- STATE FARM said her house damage was "wind" NOT
"hurricane" damage. Okay -- what is a hurricane but wind and rain? 
Thank you for listening to me.

My husband and I are non-residents & own a holiday property in Florida, is 
the policy of your government to 'chase' out overseas property investors? 
Our local property taxes have increased over 50 per cent since buying the 
property in 2003, (although we get very little for this), we are happy to 
pay our way, but when your neighbours are paying a third of what you are you 
begin to feel you are not wanted .
I await with interest your comments .

dear mr. bush:
 
i'm writing to respectfully request that you  enact some kind of relief to property owners here in florida.  just like it was done last year, in which property owners were granted extra time to pay their taxes and extend their early-payment discount, due to the hurricanes we experienced in our state.
 
i believe if you implemented similar aid this year, it would help millions of property owners, which still feel the repercusions from the storms 1 year ago compounded by a sagging real estate economy, increased fuel/energy prices and exorbitant insurance costs.  most of these increases have taken hold in the last many months, hence the help needs to be extended.  WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF SUCH HELP NOW AS WELL.
 
it is coming down to people, just like me-home and business owner, to want to get out of the state and to provide for their family a better, less-costly life.  i've considered it, but remain faithful in our leadership to help every single floridian.  this cry for help is not capricious mr. governor, it is real.  i appreciate what you did after the storms last year, but more help is needed. please commensurate the help to these floridians and your legacy shall be firmly planted in this sunshine state.
 
thank you,

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to ask you to sign HB 955, which would help ease the severe shortage of public waterway access in Florida and ensure that waterfront property is used for water-dependant purposes.

All around the state we read of condominiums springing up where marinas used to be.  It's a trend we should not allow to continue.  

Boating is one of Florida's top attractions, growing in popularity every year.  But necessary infrastructure like ramps and marinas has not kept pace with growth, and in many areas, no public-access marinas remain.  

HB 955 will help preserve the waterfront for water-dependent uses and protect Floridians' access to the public waters of the state.

Please sign HB 955

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As residents of Florida, we are very disappointed, to say the least, regarding high property taxes and preposterous homeowners insurance rates.  We are perplexed why these matters have failed to be addressed expeditiously.
 
Affordability is a grave issue for many retirees like us residing in the State of Florida.  As a result of the afore-mentioned issues, we are forced to sell our property in order to seek affordable housing in another state.
 
This is certainly a poor legacy to leave office with.

Dear Governor Bush,

The agenda for the upcoming Legislative Special Session, outlines a
path of fiscal irresponsibility that fails to adequately address our
insurance crisis and other of the state's most critical needs. While
our current tax revenue windfall is an encouraging sign, great care
should be taken to manage those funds for the coming years.

I urge you to resist any attempt to raise the constitutional-imposed
spending cap to spend the windfall.  The 10-day special session does
not provide enough time for the thoughtful debate that many of the
agenda items require.

Again, vote against any attempt to raise the state's constitutional
spending cap.  Your vote on this issue is important to me.

We had just made a permanent move to Rotonda West, Florida from the state of Maine, here we homesteaded a year ago, Our taxes have gone up from $2200 to $3000 with the homestead! We found out today that our  homeowners insurance will double to at leased $3800. This would calculate to $566 a month just for taxes and insurance. A rental is looking better all the time, or we might even have to think of moving back to Maine. Something should be done or very few will buy real estate in Florida.

Dear Governor Bush:

Teacher's internships in Florida are non paying "jobs". While in college we
pay to intern, pay for fingerprints and pay to live. Ok,so... with a 30 +
hour a week internship (plus homework which includes grading papers and
making lesson plans, so over 40 hours a week), how do I pay my bills? The
internship is only worth 6 credit hours at University of West Florida. That
allows 6 credit hours of financial aid. That is not enough to live. So, I
have to work too. So, lets add it all up. Very little financial aid, 30-40
hours internship, at LEAST 30 hours of work to pay the bills, AND just
think... Florida is in need of teachers.

So, I ask you this, you have done so many wonderful things for florida,
what can you do for the education students who are breaking their backs to
teach? Mind you these individuals won't make much of a salary once they are
teaching. 
There are more students like me, in the education classes than there are
students whos parents float the bills. You have a wealth of education
students, we are just struggling to pay our way through school.Please help 
us!  Thank you for your time.

I am glad to see a date has been set to address the insurance crisis, but you all need to know that we are struggling to survive as citizens here in Florida.  Guess what, our stores weren't busy the day after Thanksgiving here in Brevard, because we can't afford Christmas.  We are too busy paying ENORMOUS property taxes & OUTRAGEOUS insurance premiums.
 
What does it take to get noticed by any of you elected officials?

Attachments:	untitled.JPG

  
Hello Again Governor Bush,
 
         My Name is Russell Smith and back on 07/22/2003 I wrote to you about the laws that governed firefighters and the use of red warning lights. Together we made firefighters more visible on the roadways. But now it seems that there may need to be a little more to this law. I have checked laws in other states that allow firefighters to use red lights and most of the states say that if a red light is used it must be used with an audible siren. Here are some of the situations that I and other firefighters are running into. 
 

1.	When responding to a scene of a call or the fire station for a call some people don’t understand what is behind them or don’t even see us. So it slows the response. Like myself I am a Driver / Engineer and in my department sometimes I am the only driver available to drive the fire engines. In that case I sometimes get hung up in traffic which slows my response to possibly save someone’s life or property.

 

2.	See attached illustration. I have run into this situation a few times where I have come to a red traffic light to go straight thru. I come to a full stop when all traffic has stopped in the intersection I proceed with caution but it always seem that someone comes from the left or right that didn’t see my red light and didn’t’ hear me cause of no audible siren.

 
 
Just as police officers responding to calls the firefighters would have to abide by the same laws. The firefighters and police officers go thru similar emergency driving courses. The class that firefighters have to go thru is called EVOC (Emergency Vehicle Operators Course).  This teaches exactly what it says. This course is a nation wide course. Any firefighter in this state now that runs any type of red lights in his/her vehicle must have this course. This rule is already in place. 
As with any law there must be some rules. Like if a firefighter/responder misuses his or her emergency equipment it can be pulled by the Chief of the department. But these laws are also already in effect.  All emergency driving laws are taught in our EVOC course. They are the same as if we were driving the fire engines / ambulances. To the point for emergency personnel to respond to the station or to the scene in a timely fashion to save someone’s life or property we need to add the audible sirens to our vehicles. Many other states use lights and sirens for their firefighters and EMS people i.e.: West Virginia, Ohio, North and South Carolina, Georgia and many more. These are just the states that I have checked into that allow this and most all the laws are the same. The ultimate decision to who will get a red light/siren permit as it is now would be up to the Chief of the department. If you have any questions feel free to contact me at:
Luv2firefight2@aol.com
 
 
Sincerely, 
Russell Smith
 
 
PS. The attachment is just a street drawing to show one problem we have without the use of sirens.

When my mother was in the education program at University of Florida, an 
internship was worth 12 credit hours. That was back when parents paid for 
their children to go to college. As we both know, times have changed. 

There are more students like me, in the education classes than there are 
students whos parents float the bills. You have a wealth of education 
students, we are just struggling to pay our way through school. 

I understand you have made arrangements for loans to be forgiven for 
specific educational programs. That only helps those who have already 
graduated. Why not pay interns, or increase the credit hours for an 
educational internship to 12 credit hours?

What can you do to get these individuals through their college education?

I know of many other intern positions that actually pay money (not just 
minimum wage). Why can't educational interns get a little more financial 
help while in school?

Just food for thought. I know you are busy, but you seemed to really 
concentrate on and truely care about the educational system of Florida. 

Please, email me if you have any questions about anything. I can always 
poll the educational students at UWF for ideas.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:

I am disappointed in your administration for failing to anything about the
skyrocketing insurance and property tax in Miami - South Florida. As you
know Citizen the only company able to write homeowners charges in excess of
$5K to insurance our modest 400K home.

I would like to have seen your administration get the ball rolling on an
amendment to Florida constitution's homestead provision.

Finally, how did your administration do in lowering Florida's unemployment
rate and foster job growth in Miami & Broward Counties?

Good luck in your new job.

Subject:	WAL-MART SEEKS TAX BENEFITS under Florida Statute Sec. 288.106

            RE:       Application for designation of Wal-Mart Stores East LP as a Qualified Target Industry business pursuant to Section 288.106, Florida Statutes

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Florida Statute Sec. 288.206 reads, in part:

 

 The business activity or product for the applicant's project is within an industry or industries that have been identified by the office to be high-value-added industries that contribute to the area and to the economic growth of the state and that produce a higher standard of living for citizens of this state in the new global economy or that can be shown to make an equivalent contribution to the area and state's economic progress (emphasis added).  

 

I strongly object to Wal-Mart being designated a Qualified Target Industry in connection with the distribution center it wants to build in Putnam County over the strong objections of residents, as well as neighboring Volusia County.  The above-quoted language does not apply to a minimum-wage paying company like Wal-Mart.

 

I am aware that Florida Statute 288.106 was not intended to benefit low-wage retail businesses like Wal-Mart.   I don’t think Wal-Mart should receive any rebate on state taxes (which could amount to several million dollars) for a distribution center that will simply create low-wage jobs.  Further, the sole purpose for this distribution center is to supply goods to their retail stores in Florida.  This seems to go completely against the intent of this statute.

 

Thank you for your thorough review of Wal-Mart in connection with this project and their desire to receive my tax dollars for it.

Good evening
          The people don’t know what to do. As an American you always dream 
and desire to live a better life. My fiancé and I are young and trying to 
get an early start.
As home owners we are fighting the battle for our home. We live in Wakulla 
County close to Leon County and our insurance is through the ROOF!!  Our 
house payment has gone from $688.89 to the option of $812.27 (A) or $ 996.90 
(B). With option (A) we also have to pay $2,215.53 (for insurance) and still 
have our payment go up $123.28 a month. Where option (B) we have the option 
of making the $2,215.53 in twelve months and have our house payment go up 
$308.01 more dollars a month. One question... How is a family that brings 
home about $3,600.00 a month can make a house payment like this and still 
affords other living expenses?  You do the math. The sad thing is the 
insurance we have is Florida insurance by the government (Citizens of North 
Florida). I understand ARE NOT OUR GOVENOR FOR MUCH LONGER BUT YOU MUSH HAVE 
INFULENCE ON OUR NEW GOVENOR. We are not asking for your sympathy, we just 
what something done about this matter.




                                                     Sincerely,

P.S. Just remember The Florida saying...
                               No kid left behind, but what about their 
parents and their homes?

Subject:	Wal-Mart Wants Florida Citizens' Tax Dollars 

  
Dear Governor Bush:

 

I believe that you are as concerned as I am about how Florida spends its taxpayer’s dollars.

 

Putnam County is working to get Florida tax dollars to help Wal-Mart build a massive distribution center in the southern-most end of Putnam County.  Putnam County already has roads and infrastructure in place in the northern and eastern part of the county for an industry of this magnitude.  I do not think it right that Florida’s taxpayers foot the bill for Wal-Mart’s industrial distribution center, especially since it would be built in a completely unsuitable rural location.    

 

Your thorough review of this entire project is greatly appreciated, as is your concern for the well-being of Florida’s residents and how OUR tax dollars are spent.

Subject:	Property Taxes

Sir -
    The property taxes in Florida are out of control.  I am a "snowbird" and 
do not have homestaed exemption and I can not believe the rate my taxes 
increase each year.  I know property values have increased also but the 
cities and counties are not providing any increased service; they are just 
pocketing or wasting the money.  Why not adjust the millkage rate, based on 
the revenues the local government acutually needs to provide its services.  
I bought a townhouse in N Miami Beach in 1997 for 170M and the taxes were 
$3000.  Nine years later I am paying $11,500 while my adjoining neighbor, 
with the identical townhouse, is paying less than $4000, even though he 
bought it 5 years after I bought mine.  How, in any way, is that fair?  I am 
there 3 months a year, have no kids in school, no garbage to pick up in 9 
months or use no community services.  I can appreciate the argument that if 
I can afford a second home then I can pay more that the fulltime Floridian 
but I certainly do not think it should be 4 times as much.  I also own 2 
rental houses and I apartment house in Dade county and am forced to raise my 
rents every year because of the tax increases.  I have a clause in all my 
lease agreements that the rents are adjusted every year based on the tax 
increase.  These tax increases are not only unfair to the owners but to a 
larger extent to the tenants that are trying to find affordabile housing.  
Also, several years ago, the City of Miami informed me they would no longer 
collect garbage at my Apartment building and I had 45 days to provide them 
with a signed contract with one of there approved vendors or face a fine.  
This, in a year where my property taxes were raised substantially.  It is 
hard to believe this is happening and nothing is being done to correct the 
obvious inequalities.  I know there is a new Governor and I hope you will 
pass this letter to his staff but more importantly that you will personally 
speak to him about this problem.  Although presently not legally a 
Floridian, I consider myself Floridian as being a graduate of Coral Gables 
Elemetary, Ada Merritt, Coral Gables High School and the University of Miami 
and only left to serve in the Air Force and then to fly for Eastern Airlines 
in Washington and New York.  Someday I again might be a legal Floridian 
elgibile for homestead exemption, but that does not mean this problem should 
be ignored.  Think of my poor tenants.  You did well as Governor sir but 
your legacy with many people will be enhanced if you get the ball started on 
correcting this injustice.

Governor Bush:
 
The U of F Student Health Center is reaching a financial crisis and yet, the Director Dr.Barkely will not return emails or phone calls to speak with Highland Campus Health Group which will set up 3rd party billing for students with private insurance.
 
Student Health Centers are the only health care group that does not accept private insurance.  Students must pay out of pocket for any services other than the office visit at the time of the visit.  If they can't pay then when time to enroll or graduate their records are with held until the debt is paid.
 
These 3rd party funds can be used to provide additional health services on campus.
 
Parents and Students at U of F are begging for the center to accept their insurance.
 
I have contacted President Machen's office at the University and spoke with Donna and sent her the information that is attached to this email and asked for an appointment. 
 
Highland representatives will be in Florida for a Women In Government meeting, Jan 4-6 on Marco Island and would like to extend our time and visit with appropriate staff on Jan 8 or 9.
 
With the financial situations most states find themselves in at this time, to have addition funds available at no cost to the University would encourage staff to at least look at the program.
 
Highland certifies all doctors in the health center so they are in network with all major insurance, set us coding and provide an electronic medical record system.   All of this is done by Highland at no cost to the state, Highland gets paid only when 3rd party payments are being received.
 
Would you have a member of your staff please meet with Highland and hopefully have a member of the Univesity staff meet also.   Governor Perry staff in Texas is very interested in the student health centers enterning this program and not raise student fees in the future for health care.   Parents are glad to have their insurance accept and not have to pay out of pocket for health services for their student.
 
Thank you for your assistance.   Staff can reach me at the address below.

Dear Mr. Bush:
 
I find myself afloat among mixed emotions of anger, frustration and sorrow at the current state of the Florida economy, housing in particular.
 
Being that I have made my income in the inspections, repairs and building aspect of the housing market for the last 10 years I'm angry to say that I have to move out of Florida with the rest of us who choose to pursue this field, to find work again in other states where the housing markets are fair.
 
Due in large to political decisions and actions (or inactions as the case may be) by our representatives in all three offices of this state, you have not only allowed the individual counties to increase taxes over 100% with no justification, you have also allowed insurance companies (like Citizen) to increase rates over 120% (with still no end in sight) causing the housing sales & construction market to come to a near dead stop with absolutely no financial consideration as to the repercussions of this action.
 
As things currently stand, to buy a 900 sqft, 2 bedroom, 2 bath home in west central Florida, you must be able to afford a monthly expense of $750.00 monthly mortgage payment, $150.00 monthly tax payment a $200.00 monthly dwelling insurance, $100.00 monthly flood insurance and $75.00 monthly wind insurance (hurricane coverage). That works out to nearly $400.00 per month for insurance and when you add the taxes we are paying nearly 70% of our mortgage payments in extra costs.
 
Mr. Bush.  If a 900sqft, 2 bedroom, one bath, one car garage home costs $100,000 to buy and your income is less than $100,000 a year as a single parent, you can't get a loan because you won't qualify for financing due to these extra costs.
 
Ironically, very few single parents make that much and worse yet, many single parents and other people are now being forced into foreclosure due to this financial ineptitude, myself one of them.
(In this income range currently in the State of Florida, it's less expensive to rent the same size apartment for $800.00 a month than buy a house for $1,100.00 a month).
 
You as Governor, are responsible for any and all the problems of this State just as any captain is responsible for any and all problems on his ship.
If you do not do something immediately to create some relief for us, you will not only leave this state worse than it was when you got it, but with the responsibility of having increased the Florida homeless statistics single-handedly.
 
As a suggestion:
    Why not:

1.	Establish an immediate moratorium on foreclosure procedures,
2.	Require the counties to return to a realistic taxing rate (perhaps a flat rate)
3.	Require the insurance companies to do away with the ridiculous wind policy and return to reasonable rates spread across the entire state of Florida rather than incurring the burden of insurance cost and profit on just the coastal areas
4.	Require all Florida counties to institute a mortgage assistance program similar to Pasco County's Community Development Division Program and finally,
5.	Put someone in the Insurance Commissioners office that can do the job properly (after 3 years, Kevin McCarty has obviously demonstrated he is ineffectual).

We, the citizens of the State of Florida, will wait, watch and remember how you leave us.

I am a certified Correctional Officer here in the state of Florida. I have a couple of questions I was hoping you might be able to answer.
Myself, and pretty much everyone from my  facility voted for you. We all know that you were good for us. the PBA stands firmly behind you.
My questions are as follows:
 
How come the county Corrections make so much more than us?  There are many good officers leaving the State to go to the County strictly because of the pay increase.
Will there be any major salary increase for us?
 
Equiptment.  Our equiptment is so old and outdated. Its so bad that its like a time warp back to the 1970's , meanwhile county has new up to date equiptment.
 
Is there anything on the horizon about giving us arrest powers?  I have heard that might be a possibilty in the future.
 
 
I know that you are busy, and you might not be able to reply, but  from all of us who support you,
 
 
Good Luck,
You have been a wonderful governor

Governor Bush,

I am a retired Florida State employee. I served some of the most needy
persons for 30 years as a mental health professional at the Florida State
Hospital. I am disappointed that career service employees, particularly
those who toil in the trenches do not get a decent retirement stipend upon
retirement with 30 or more years of continuous service. While correctional
officers get somewhat better benefits the rank and file employee at mental
health institutions, who face serious bodily harm and danger daily, get much
less. There are certain classes of employee who do receive better benefits.
However, those classes usually have less direct contact with residents while
receiving increased benefits. Frankly, something is very wrong with this.

Regarding privatization, I firmly believe that this trend is harmful to
those being served. This is quite obvious based on reports from around the
state in the media. I am certainly not advocating unrestricted spending but
careful and thoughtful administration under State auspices through
established public institutions will provide acceptable quality of services
without private corporations milking the system though cost overruns, poorly
trained employees and profits above acceptable quality care. Privatization
at all levels only adds to a system that rewards mediocre services with less
oversight. The role of a government is to protect its citizens, provide for
infrastructure and defense. Certain functions can and should be accomplished
with private contracting. Social and mental health services as well as
public education to name three should not be among those that rely on the
private sector. Private businesses should not benefit from lessened
oversight and control while public institutions get slammed for problems.
The trend for private takeover of essential government services is dangerous
at all levels. Your very active support of the privatization of government
activities is just plain wrong in my most humble opinion.

It is time to rethink this trend while at the same time support those loyal
career service employees through appropriate levels of benefits while
employed and compensation upon retirement that provides for an acceptable
quality of life.

Thank you for your time,

Leon Hilfstein

Honestly, Florida Medicaid and the state of health care for the poor in this country is a joke.  There is no other way to come to the point.  The income levels that are required to qualify for medicaid is borderline starvation.  There is no way a family with two incomes can qualify for medicaid unless the are both making minimum wage and have two or more children.  Does anyone else see anything wrong with this picture?
 
Further, the average doctor visit can barely be paid by the working poor in this country that has now replaced the middle class.  A person could go to a doctor and have to pay for lab. work and medication(s) if required.  That could run in the hundreds of dollars.  The only other option is for the person to be so sick they have to go to an emergency room, pray they can pay the bill some day and hope they can afford the medication.  This is a waste of time for emergency rooms, because if the average person could afford health care, then a preventive visit with a physician would have been adequate.  Hospitals are going broke from providing non paid emergency services, people are dieing of late diagnosed cancer, because they had no means for regular checkups, they are dieing from completely treatable diseases but had no insurance to go to a doctor, committing suicide, because they had no insurance to go to a doctor for mental health, receiving poor or no prenatal care, because they have had no access to a doctor and did I mention permanent damage to vital organs because WHY?  People have no money and or insurance to go to a doctor.
 
Now please tell me what can you do as the Governor of the state of Florida to help remedy this situation?  I have an idea from your previous actions what you feel about medicaid and medicaid recipients.  Its a good thing our tax dollars is paying for your health insurance and at the risk of sounding very bitter, I have to say never mind about our tax dollars paying for your health insurance, because you come from a wealthy family.  I think they should pay for your medical expenses, if they are not are ready.  It is clear you truly do not care for the average voter. Until you have been in the trenches with us average people, you know nothing.
 
Good Luck and Take Care

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I reside in Hillsborough County. I own my primary residence and also a townhouse. I also own a vacant waterfront lot in Charlotte County. My tax bills and insurance are going to bankrupt my family within the next two years. I have been trying to sell both the lot and the townhouse to no avail. Primary because of the taxes and insurance.
 
I am  a Realtor and the market has hit a wall!!!!! Nobody is moving from home to home due to the tax consequences and insurance. In addition our annual flock of snowbirds are not buying because of this reason. They are going to Georgia, Tennessee, North and South Carolina. People cannot afford to live in Florida. Floridians will be living in droves sooner than you think!!
 
I will be forced to settle for any offer I get on my properties and then I have to say goodbye to my home state for the past 36 years. Why.... I can't afford to live here and my household is a 6 figure income. I have no idea how less fortunate people are making it!! 
 
I hope that you leave office with your successor attuned to the need to address this immediately. I also hope this tax issue does not become your legacy!

Subject:	Our Gulf - LAST STAND 

Dear Governor Bush,  

As I looked out on the beautiful Gulf of Mexico this morning from my marvelous vantage point here in our home on Casey Key, I suddenly felt very sad. Like your dad, I now shed tears with mixed emotions. This in spite of the fact that the water is clear today and the pelicans are playful.   I know that I will take a walk on the beach later now that we have a respite from the Red Tide.  In addition to this plague upon us, we have already suffered erosion over the years due to the variants allowed for various armoring projects along our prestine coastline.  Yet along our more than 200 feet on the Gulf  the sea turtles still return to nest every year.  Nature finds a way.  Then there is the threat of hurricanes - a risk we assumed when we decided to buy a home on a barrier island. No doubt a direct storm would find our weak unarmored property and probably open up a new channel as was done years ago at Midnight Pass!  What I did not anticipate was your failure along with your brothers (and now our Florida senators) to protect our coastline from oil drilling after promises to the contrary in your several political campaigns.  Of course, you could still live up to these promises right now by stopping the advance of the current legislation that has been given priority this week in the Congress...that last greedy grab of our natural resources by this generation without due consideration of our children and grandchildren already facing the financial burden they will bear from our diplomatic failures in the world. Then there is the veto power of the President as a last resort.  How naive of me to think that a family whose fortune was made in off-shore drilling would now take a stand for Florida's Gulf coast against the special interests of the oil industry!  Even so, I do have faith that you and your family would be willing to take a last stand for Florida because of your family tradition of service that goes back generations. I used to think I knew your family even though I have never met any of the members.  Friends in Connecticut were great admirers of Prescott and we all wanted your dad to win the presidency his first time 'round. There were also background similarities - my ancestors from colonial Massachusetts and Connecticut...the Episcopal Church...the loss of our daughter Robin from a congenital heart defect as a little child.  I must admit I have become disillusioned over the last decade but hope and faith spring eternal.  Do the right thing.  If for no other reason, consider our increased vulnerability as a result of using up our natural resources now instead of saving something for the future.

Considering our legacy in life,

I am writing today to inquire about the status of funding for the Justice Administrative Commission. The JAC website indicates that they will not receive additional funds to pay due process costs and attorney's fees until December 19 without the assistance of the legislature and Governor's Office.
 
Thank you in advance for any updates on the status of this matter.

Subject:	Taxing me out of my home

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I live in Bartow, Florida (Polk County) and  just built a home (1830 E.F. Griffin Rd. 33830).  We moved in on Feb. 12, 2006.  Our home is 3bdr/2bath on 1 acre (2786 living/3800 under roof).  We have been informed by Polk County Tax Appraiser that our expected taxes will rise to $7,320 yr. starting in the year 2007(double previous taxes).  When we called the tax appraiser's office, we asked if the doubled taxes were because we lived in the city of Bartow.  They said it does not matter where you live in Florida (real estate and assessment taxes), that everybody's taxes are doubling.  They also said it will only take an action from the Governor to repair the taxing system.  They also said that people are being taxed out of their homes everyday.  I am speechless regarding the fact that there may be no place in Florida we can have a decent home because the taxes are too high!?!
 
I am very desperate to receive a response from your office.  Can a Florida native not afford to live in Florida anymore???   What a sad realization this may be.  We are a hard working family that deserves to live in a decent home, but can we afford to raise our family in Florida?Please, please let me know if there are any changes coming our way regarding taxes.... and/or explain if our taxes are only higher because we live in Bartow (I don't think so).
 
I really appreciate your time and response.
 
Sincerely,
 
Stacey L. Seay

I am one of those attorneys who accept court-appointed indigent clients.  In fact, that is the sole focus of my practice.  Because of the problems with non-funding and non-release of funds, I am now living on loans.  

I have not received a payment from the JAC since October 8, 2006 which was in the amount of $712.63.

I am single.  I have no medical insurance and no other benefits that State of Florida employees enjoy.  I have no other source of cash-flow.  The JAC payments are my only source of income.  I have taken out loans to live on until funding comes through.  By the time funding comes through, I will have incurred interest fees on the loans while I am waiting for payment for services rendered and made in good faith with the State of Florida.  

Your lack of attention to this matter is causing me to become indigent while I provide services to the indigent.  

I may be risking backlash in the form of being passed over for court appointments in the future because of this letter to you, however, I am risking that to let you know that your lack of attention to this funding crisis is an egregious act of ignorance and shows total lack of concern for the process of the judicial system in this state.

Importance:	High

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush,
 
I voted for you before and a now I voted for Mr. Crist.
 
I came from Argentina to USA in 1981 to go to College in Connecticut. After my graduation, I moved to Florida where I live since.
 
I know your time is short and I will be very brief.
 
Most of my income goes to pay for insurance; health, home, life, car, you name it.
 
As you are very well aware, the costs are impossible to be paid right now. Yesterday I have to pick up some medicine for my wife and they want me to charge around $ 700.00 because of the new deductible for medicine was reduced. I also have some medicines for my children that were not covered complete as before. So, I am paying much more for much less coverage.
 
The same story with Home Insurance and I never had a big claim after all the Hurricanes including Andrew!
 
There is no way that this can go on like this. The American Dream is now the American Nightmare. What is the future for us and our families? Do we have to move out of the State? Is that what my politicians want?
 
Solutions:
 
For Home: a National Disaster Insurance that will make it easy for everybody including Insurance Companies.
 
For Health: we have the best medicine but only for rich people. Make it affordable like they do in Europe, even in some countries if Free. USA is the number one economy in the world, we pay a lot of taxes in everything we do, why we cannot do it?
 
I know you are leaving office, but you may help working together with Mr. Crist and also with Mr. George W. Bush.
 
I hope that you may read this e-mail.
 
Sincerely yours,

Subject: Actual Homeowner's Insurance and Property Tax Crisis Examples

Gov Bush and Gov-Elect Crist: 
 
I've attached scans of my latest homeowner's insurance cancellation letter and my son's Volusia County tax bill for his vacant, palmetto-covered 50' X 175' lot.
 
Regarding the insurance cancellation, I'm a 56 year old Florida native who has never filed a homeowner's insurance claim even though I've been a homeowner in Palm Beach and Volusia Counties since I was 23. I've always done whatever I could to protect my home from damage of all kinds. I have full hurricane protection consisting of removable panels which I installed before the disastrous '04 season. I suffered no damage while my neighbors (also insured by the same company in some cases) did nothing to protect their homes prior to the storms nor to prevent further weather-related or mold-related damage after the storms. They filed large claims which were paid by their insurers despite doing nothing to mitigate potential damage while I did everything possible and did prevent damage yet I'm being dropped as fast as they drop those customers who are and always were, poor risks. Where's the logic there especially given their elaborate screening process for new policies? You're a good risk until they decide you're a bad risk even though nothing has changed except their desire to insure you??? You need to force all insurers that are in the homeowner's market anywhere in the US to offer it here or get out of Florida all together - no Florida subsidiaries and no excuses. 
 
2nd, regarding the property bill attached, note that the Ad Valorem taxes on the smallish, albeit waterfront, vacant lot are $9826.46! Brian, an Air Force F-16 pilot and father of two small children, has had the lot on the market for a year (can't sell it either!) since he's decided that he cannot afford to live in Florida on the lot of his dreams!!! Even if you forget the fact that Volusia County has the 3rd highest millage rate in the state, why should a vacant lot be charged at the same rate as one with a home or business upon it? A vacant lot doesn't use the school system ($3,748), it doesn't get sick and need the hospital district at $1,080, it just sits there consuming no services until someone builds on it. You need to change the law to correct this blatant tax grab. So, let me illustrate further -  Brian's vacant lot pays over $9800 per year in tax, my nearby waterfront house built in '99 on the same size lot pays about $6000, my neighbor's built a few years before that pays about $3000 and so on down the ridiculous and inequitable line is the best tax system we can offer? Please address this terrible situation before we all go under! Like most of my friends, I'm looking at leaving the state upon my retirement as I can't afford the taxes I will pay if this system isn't changed. I looked up my County Councilman's tax bill and that of the County Council Chairman - $1200 and $1500 respectively - they feel no tax pain and don't even bother to return e-mails on the subject and won't until you force the issue.
 
Florida's Golden Goose (as long as I've been alive) has been development, tourism, and as  a haven for retirees. Now two of the three are dead or dying fast. You need to do something real and not just a band-aid homestead exemption doubling - the whole system needs to be re-vamped. I'll even consider a state income tax if it gets us some equity in the property tax arena!

CECIL FIELD COMMERCE CENTER SELECTED AS SITE FOR MAJOR AVIATION PRODUCTION
SITE

On Monday, I applauded the C-27J industry team of L-3 Communications
Integrated Systems, Finmeccanica's Alenia North America, Global Military
Aircraft Systems and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems for their commitment
to establish the group's advanced aircraft operation at Jacksonville's Cecil
Commerce Center if awarded a Department of Defense contract. I toured the
C-27J aircraft and potential assembly and production site along with
Congressman Ander Crenshaw, Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton, and state and
local business leaders. In selecting Jacksonville's Cecil Field, the C-27J
Joint Cargo Aircraft team has embraced the strengths of our state's
pro-business climate, robust defense industry and highly skilled aviation
and aerospace workforce. This new assembly and production activity will
enhance Florida' economy and would be a great addition to the state's
thriving aviation sector, currently the third strongest in the nation. Most
importantly, the C-27J will help our men and women of the Army and the Air
Force continue to serve and defend our country. The Department of Defense
is expected to award the Joint Cargo Aircraft contract in early 2007. Should
the Department award the multi-billion dollar contract to the C-27J team,
the group will begin establishing its advanced aircraft operation at the
Jacksonville site in 2007. The facility is expected to employ more than 200
people. For more information on our economic development initiatives,

2006 FLORIDA YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE SURVEY RESULTS ANNOUNCED

On Tuesday, I announced the results of the 2006 Florida Youth Substance
Abuse Survey. In the last eight years, we have worked to strengthen
substance abuse prevention, and we have seen significant progress in the
cause. This year's results confirm that progress is being made, but the
work is not done. Since 2000, Florida has seen declines in the use of
heroin, ecstasy and LSD, as well as in the use of cigarettes and alcohol.
This year, 12 of the 21 categories measured current use below two percent.
Conducted among 6th through 12th graders throughout the state for the
seventh consecutive year, the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey is the
most extensive survey of its kind in the nation. The survey assesses
lifetime drug usage and current usage. I was joined for Tuesday's
announcement by First Lady Columba Bush, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings,
Director of the Florida Office of Drug Control Bill Janes, state agency
heads, law enforcement officials and substance abuse prevention specialists
- key partners in reducing substance abuse throughout the state. For view
the complete results of the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey,

I was very disappointed with the way the committee ran and with their official report I found online.  Part of the problem with not really opening up the proceeding to get public input.  The meetings were not publicized.  They should at least have been publicized in public libraries and community centers, if not in the major newspapers.

 

One thing that is needed is to prevent companies from cherry-picking the lowest risk business.  Any insurance company that does not provide house/condo insurance in Florida should not be allowed to do other kinds of business here, not auto, not health.  The insurance companies would quickly straighten out their act if they had to share their pools of risk.

 

Cost of post-hurricane repairs and rising premiums are so bad that, at least for our whole condo development, it might be more affordable to self-insure.  What we need in order to do that is have the Division of Risk Management provide guidelines for self-insurance and getting reinsurance.

Dear Mr. Bush, 

 

Please let me know why you would create a committee to meet today in Orlando to help “come up with potential solutions for giving relief to property owners”  regarding property taxes that would not be required to give a final report until the end of next year?  Are you kidding?  Is this our government at its best?   This is an immediate problem for the State of Florida that needs to be resolved.   

 

My last twenty years have been spent doing real estate closings in the State of California, and Florida.   I have not seen our market any slower than it is now, and it is primarily due to overwhelming taxes and property insurance in this state.    For many years people would move to “retire” to Florida or purchase their second home here.   Seniors on a fixed income can no longer afford to live here, some paying and additional $300.00 to $500.00 a month for taxes and insurance.  Younger families cannot afford it either.  Last year at this time I was closing 50-75 new purchases and refinances a month, this month I closed 25.  

 

Government needs to consider the fact that many people in the real estate and title and banking industry are losing their jobs due to this OVERWHELMING problem.   Please let me know who it is in your committee that is representing us.   It is not just affecting those who pay the property taxes it is affecting ALL OF US IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.   I have spoken with people all over the state, and in fact an attorney in New York just today who agrees with me.  

 

So, when I ask are you kidding?? One year??  Should I just let my children know after I lose my job to wait a year, and then they can eat again? Or have a roof over their head?   How many of us will end up in unemployment?  Who will pay my high property taxes then?   The government?

 

We need to generate our economy, and entice people to move here again.  With the bad rap we got from the hurricanes, not to mention insurance hikes and property taxes Florida is looking like the last place anyone can afford to live.

 

This committee needs to come up with a solution NOW, not next year.  I will be more than happy to participate in any way possible to get this to happen, so please let me know if a spot opens up.   I think the 15-member committee should put their heads together and get this resolved by January, and lower our 2007 property taxes.

 

 

Sincerely,

 

Michelle McClure

Subject:	PROPERTY TAXES

  
Dear Mr. Bush,
 
Per a very close associate of mine, who copied her email she sent you.  I am adding my own two cents to this issue.  
 
I like her and many others in Indian River County are in the Real Estate Business in some capacity and therefore the issue of major tax increases and ridiculous insurance rates have taken our lively hood down to all most nothing.  Most of the people here in this county have enough trouble making a living unless they live on the barrier island where they are multi millionaires and it doesn't matter.  But those of us who provide the services these people need are quickly losing the capability of supporting our families.  When we don;'t generate monies in the area then a lot of others are impacted as well.  The car dealers have cut their inventories to the bone, the restaurants are not as busy as we cant afford to go out to eat and so the waiters and waitresses have a major pay cut.  Retailers are feeling the crunch as black Friday passed without all of the jam packed buying that normally occurs.  
 
In this county and as I have heard from talking to multiple people from other counties.  If these issues OF TAXES AND INSURANCE are not addressed and I mean yesterday, there will be a lot of us on umemployment, unable to feed our children and lose our homes.  We already have a major increase of foreclosures and if you look at the figures Florida is now higher than almost every other state in the United States.
 
So if you think an answer by the end of 2007 is going to work I am here to tell you, you are totally incorrect by then it will be too late for too many people and you and these other people will contribute to the amount of homeless people who already roam our streets. 
 
I IMPLORE YOU TO TAKE ACTION NOW AND FIX THESE ISSUES AND LISTEN TO THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA.  WE MAY BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TOTEM BUT WE KEEP IT STANDING TALL. 
 
P.S. In my haste I didn't sign The first email.

Dear Ms. McClellan-Roddenberry:

Thank you for your response to me on behalf of Governor Bush.

I believe from the tone of your letter that there is some degree of understanding and sympathy on your part and that of the Governor for what people like myself are going through in this deplorable situation. To put it in human terms: I feel despair, sick with profound sadness, depressed, terrified, frustrated, angry, and bitter at the thought that I have worked hard all my life, always contributed to society and to my government, only to have my government turn around and take it all away from me. I cannot imagine anyone with an iota of feeling not being able to relate to what I am going through.

I will be at a hearing on Friday, December 8, 2006 with the Hillsborough County Value Adjustment Board (VAB) at 601 East Kennedy Blvd., Tampa. I believe the Governor is a good and just man. I have never asked anything of my government for myself; I now ask for his support in whatever way possible to help me with this agency in my plea for a more reasonable tax on my property. $8000, $7000, $6000, $5000, $4000 are all TOO MUCH for me to pay in taxes.

Following are queries and suggestions for consideration by anyone attempting to solve the current plight of the homeowner vs. property taxation in Florida today. Since I live in Hillsborough County, I will address my grievances toward that entity – but they apply to every other taxpaying citizen, county and municipality in the state.

INEQUITY

My immediate neighbor's adjoining property (3302 Yellowknife Circle) is the same size as mine (3.24 acres). My land is contiguous and continuous with his. The neighbor's 1.4 acres, on which his house and stables sit, are designated Use Code 9950, Land Use Description Acreage Class 50, assessed at $68,600.00. The remaining 1.84 acres of their property are designated as Use Code LOWLANDS and assessed at $1,380.00.

My house and shed sit on less than 1 acre of land. The remaining 2.24(+) acres to the sides and the rear of the house are wild lowlands. Looking at an aerial map of both our properties, you cannot tell where one ends and where the other begins – the properties are identical in elevation – or rather, descent. However, all of my 3.24 acres were classified as Use Code 9950, Land Use Description Acreage Class 50. As a result, all of the land was assessed at $144,180.00.

Further, I am not using the remaining 2.24(+) acres. Nor do I intend to; what for – so I can get taxed more? They are just wild woods. My neighbor's land assessment is for $69,980.00; mine is $144,180.00. Where is the justice here?

Also, as I indicated in my previous e-mail to the Governor, my property was initially assessed at $34,400.00. Then it jumped to $55,000.00. Then $144,180.00. I thought that county rules prevented property from being assessed at more than 3% higher per succeeding year. Over a 4 year span, my assessment went up by 419%! If the above land assessment was prompted by the building of my home, then this is mere opportunism and gouging by the Property Assessor.

I was previously homesteaded in Bradenton for 14 years. I did not move out of the state. I moved into Hillsborough County in order for my wife and I to be closer to our jobs. Why couldn’t my Homestead status be continued when I changed residence and moved into Hillsborough County? This is where my home was being built – why did my land appraisal jump so high?

I paid for $35,000 for our 3.24 acre property. That’s all it’s worth to me and would not have paid another penny for it. I bought it to live on it until I die, with no plans to sell it. I have no qualms paying property tax on the amount I paid for it – but to have it appraised at $155,000 + is absolutely ridiculous. I am living on only less than 1 acre of my land – why then is all of it appraised so high?

We sacrificed and sent our children to private schools. We do not have children in school. Why do we have to pay for other people’s children’s schooling?

We provide our own water and pay for our own electricity. What services is Hillsborough County providing us with that would be worth $8,000.00?


A CAP ON REAL ESTATE TAXES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER


If Hillsborough County got along fine with my $2,000.00 in taxes last year, why was it necessary for the Property Assessor to increase my taxes by 400% to a staggering and crippling $8,000.00? Why can't $2,000.00 be sufficient as my "fair share"? There are thousands and thousands more homeowners throughout the county due to all the building that has gone on. If each of those households is paying $2,000.00 in property taxes, why isn't that enough for the county?


VALUE ADJUSTMENT BOARD IMPARTIALITY?


Special magistrates are appointed to preside over VAB hearings – which our tax dollars pay for. My understanding is that these persons are in the real estate profession. If so, then that brings their impartiality into question – after all, real estate brokers make more money on sales of properties with higher sales values, which higher property assessments imply, so it is in their best interests for properties to be assessed high and it would be natural for them to resist any lowering in assessments as it would threaten their income. This implies a conflict of interest on the part of said magistrates that are part of the real estate industry.


DOWNSIZING THE BEAUROCRACY


1.	Has anybody done an accounting of just how many employees are currently working for Hillsborough County? Does it number in the thousands or tens of thousands? 
2.	Just how many office employees and receptionists are required in order to keep a beaurocracy running smoothly? How many of these positions are essential? How much money would be saved by eliminating as many non-essential beaurocratic positions as possible? 
3.	There is a far greater need for medical workers such as EMTs, Paramedics, and Nurses. Non-essential county workers should be sent for medical and teaching training and placed in private hospitals, fire departments, private ambulance companies and private schools. 
4.	How about eliminating county governments altogether and letting everything emanate from the State level? My understanding is that there was a fiscal surplus this last year and monies were refunded to the counties – how about returning those monies to the taxpayers instead of giving it back to county beaurocrats to spend on themselves?

Who is responsible for the horrendous tax rates? County Commissioners? An individual? How do they arrive at their disastrous figures? Who are they accountable to? What are we, serfs, born to do the bidding of a higher class, never to have a life of our own? Do the taxing authorities collectively believe they are the sheriffs of Nottingham? Do they think they are entitled to levy taxes and plunder the citizenship at will with no accountability?

Thank you for your attention. Please pass this on to the appropriate authority and register my feelings with them.

Very truly yours,

Angel Rivera

Subject:	Re: Maintenance Fee on Timeshare

Gov Bush,
 
I'm a time share owner at Barefoot on the Keys in Kysseme, Florida.  Our maintenance fee is set to increase by well over 100%.  The explanation given is due to the Property Insurance rates in Florida.  This increase makes it impossible for us as retirees to continue to pay our maintenace fee on our time share.  When we  are living on a fixed income and suddenly there is a great increase like this, it is very sad when we will  probably have to let go our property.  With this increase, we could afford to go on a vacation and pay for it for less money that our maintenance fee on the property will be.  I ask that you look at the problem and see if there isn't some fair soultion to it.

Subject:	Property Taxes - very concerned property owner

Importance:	High

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

I have to say first that I am a proud Republican and have supported the entire Bush Family’s political agendas for the past 14 years, since I started voting.  I am 32 years old married with two kids.  We moved to West Palm Beach in the summer of 2003 and bought a lovely home on the “Lake” block.  We thought we would live there for many years to come, but unfortunately my husband’s job took us up to New Hampshire.  We decided to keep our house in Florida for several reasons:  

 

1.	We thought it was a sound investment
2.	A great vacation spot for friends and family
3.	We planned on moving home someday

 

However, with the current state of the property taxes we will be forced to sell our home at an undervalued amount if YOU don’t do something about these rising taxes, which are VERY unjust and unfair, not to mention unaffordable.

 

In the last two years our property taxes have jumped from $9,000.00 to almost $14,000.00 and at the going rate will hit $20,000 by the summer of 2008, when we had planned on moving home.  NO ONE can afford nor should be asked to pay these types of property taxes.  We have a home in LA County as well and we only pay $5,000 a year on a home that is valued at twice the amount our Florida home is valued at.  GO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT!!!

 

If the part time residents of Florida continue to burden the rising costs of the illegal aliens and other blood sucking agendas, you are going to LOSE all tourisms in Florida.  Florida will become one HUGE section 8 community because the housing market will be flooded with real estate that people just simply can’t afford!  

 

I am all for property taxes, but come on, this is totally ludicrous.  At these rates you are going to lose the appeal of So. Florida living.  No one will want a vacation home here.  It isn’t worth it.  South Carolina and North Carolina are flourishing right now because they don’t penalize you for not living in your house year round.  

 

YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING.  SO GO TO WORK FOR THE WORKING CLASS.  Don’t penalize your citizens who work HARD at making you a dollar!!!  

 

DO SOMETHING NOW.  Otherwise, you will have an even more intense DOWNWARD SPIRAL of the housing market in Florida.  You have the power.  Get congress together today and MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.  

 

HELP ME to not have to sell my beloved home….

 

Thank you,

Governor Bush,
       The homeowners of Pinellas County need your help to fight against the alarming increase in real estate taxes. I am a single parent whom works in the medical field and cuts every corner to make ends meet. The pay scale here is horrible enough, now they want 3/4 of what I make to pay taxes. Last night I had to explain to my children that there will be no Christmas this year and also I will not be able to be home when they get home from school because I have been forced to work 2 full time jobs so we have a place to live. Their reaction was " why did you want to move to this state anyway, it's all about the money". Sad to say I now agree with them and am truely sorry I moved here. Thank you for your time and I hope you will seriously consider doing something.  Donna Hannah

Subject:	Lowering College Costs

To whom it may concern,

          My name is Ethan Ferguson and i am currently completing my second 
year at Hillsborough Community College. I am writing you to request a 
revision in the budget to further supplement the cost of our college tuition 
and books. As you can imagine, this matter is of the utmost importance and 
affects both present and future students. Please don't misunderstand me and 
think that i am in any way ungreatful for the amount of assistance that you 
have already rendered. It is just that there are so many young people with a 
hunger to learn that aren't afforded the opportunity to go to college 
because of financial restraints. I realize that the state's budget is 
probably spread sparsely among the different departments but any additional 
funds allocated toward supplementing tuition costs should be seen as an 
investment in the country's future. After all, the college students of today 
will be the backbone of the workforce tomorrow. The more educated they are, 
the more productive they will be and this will in turn result in economic 
growth for the entire country. Any consideration that you may give this 
proposal will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

      Ethan Ferguson

Subject:	JAC Funding

Dear Governor,

 

Or may I say Jeb,

 

I work for a “Conflict” Attorney’s office in the 5th circuit.  In other words, we take the cases the Public Defenders Office has a conflict with.

 

And the case load is amazing…….The PD’s office conflicts out because of co-defendants or previous prosecution at an alarming rate.

 

We accept all those cases that are given to us and go about our task of representing these individuals as they need to be by the Constitution and Law of the State.

 

Today, we were told there is no more money allocated through the JAC until 2007 for our services.

 

I work for a hard and true Attorney, who has not given up, despite what has been heard, or what might be in the future, she has leveraged finances to continue her representation as assigned by the Counties within the 5th Circuit.

 

But as of today “we” a staff of five, have been “put on notice” that the State has no money for our services, and we will have to explore other options at this time.  

 

Thus, we have no job……….Thus the other 2 or 3 thousand who work on the side of Justice for the Defendant as “Conflict Defenders” will have no job either.

 

I was hit a week prior by court reporters, psychologists, and forensics professionals all with the same, “no pay, no work” attitude.  And nothing against these persons, most have had to wait 6 to 8 months for payment of services even when the money was available from the JAC.

 

Please Sir, Jeb,  if you have the opportunity, take a look at what is happening.  Our Judicial system is already at a maximum and population waiting for trial continues to grow.  If the JAC cannot fund the “Conflict Defenders” the “Court Reporters”, the “Forensic Experts”……then we will fall into a “quagmire”…. strike that….. we’ll fall into a pit of fast setting cement!  That will take us years to chip through and correct.  Our over burdened Court system might not survive.

 

Thank you for your time.

Dear Jeb-

 

My husband and I are very concerned and also victims of the current fiasco which is called our property tax system. We are looking to be retirees in a few years, if we can ever afford to retire. We recently moved from Pompano Beach to Melbourne for many reasons, but one was economic. It is very expensive to live in South Florida. We knew we could not afford to retire there. We sold our house down there and used the money to buy a house and a small business up in Melbourne.

 

In Pompano, we had Homestead. We moved up here, and even though we have had Homestead in two houses in South Florida and have moved from one house to the other, this one being our third – we have had to start all over again on Homestead and will not get it this year. It could end up affecting our taxes next year. Plus, we have been assessed more for our home here in Melbourne that we paid for it!! We tried to do something about it, but they won’t even discuss it. This is NOT fair, Jeb!

 

**First of all, when you have Homestead, it should stay with you even if you move. Why do people get penalized because they upsize or downsize or relocate?

 

**Next, people should not be taxed over what they pay for a house. The house we bought was for sale for a long time. No one wanted it. Real estate is down. How can we be taxed higher that what the market bore for this house?

 

**Taxes should remain for people who upsize, downsize or relocate. We should not be penalized because we moved. It made it very hard as a seller to sell our house because of what the new owners would pay. You are killing us, Jeb!!!

 

I have a hard time with property taxes paying for schools, etc – and for seniors having to pay for schools through their taxes – especially when it forces them to leave their homes because they can no longer afford the taxes. I will be there soon. Those not owning property get off free, even if they have kids in school. There is just no equity there! My dad has paid property taxes for 65 years – when is it enough???? I guess he has to go to an old folks home and no longer be an independent man.

 

Something needs to be done. You have appointed a committee – are they really going to DO something or just be a committee?????????????? 

 

I voted for you and your brother. I believed in you. Please don’t let us down

Subject:	property taxes

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a 47 year old single mom who has owned a home in St. Petersburg Florida for the last 20 years.  I have contributed to the community by being employed and paying my taxes each year and I have a question for your consideration.
 
When I purchased my property approximately 20 years ago I paid $45,000.00 for the property.  Therefore,  the value of this property is $45,000.00.   However, each year my property appraisal value increases and now the tax collector appraises the value of my property as close to $180,000.00.  
 
The  appraisal figure  is what I am taxed on each year  not the price of the property.  I feel that since I paid $45,000.00 for the property and I contribute to the community each year by earning money and paying taxes it is unfair I am taxed on an appraised value and not the realistic true value of what I paid for the property.  
 
I have no intention of selling my property and yet I am being taxed on what the county is appraising my home for.   Respectively, it is only worth $45,000.00 because that is what I paid for the property.  
 
If I were to sell the property for $180,000.00 it would only be fair that it would be the responsibility of the new buyer to be responsible for paying taxes on the price they paid for the property. 
 
The tax collectors assessment of the value should only be a standard for what the community feels the value of my house is if I were to sell it.  Not a figure that I am taxed on.   I would have never purchased a house for $180,000.00 to begin with as computing insurance, taxes, etc this would have put me out of my league. Respectively, why should I be paying property taxes on an appraised value?  Where did I ever agree to that when I purchased my home?  
 
The tax bill should be rated on the price of the property not the tax collectors appraisal.   I don't know who's idea paying taxes on the appraised value was, but if you think about it, its totally wrong.
 
My neighbor moved a few years ago and sold her house for $40,000.00.  The people that bought the house fixed it up and re sold it for $95,000.00.  This figure was totally absurd, however, the purchaser agreed to pay that amount and that should be the amount the new purchaser is taxed on.  Meanwhile, my property value increase dramatically because someone was dumb enough to pay $95,000.00 for a $40,000.00 house next door.
 
I believe in consistency because I feel that is fair for everyone.   Instead of having a homestead exemption there should be a standard percentage for property tax.  For example 5% of the price the homeowner paid for the property each year.  This way you know if you spend $5,000.00, $50,000.00 or $500,000.00 what your taxes are.  We spend our life budgeting for things and I don't feel its fair I have to budget for an appraised value bill instead of the actual value of the property.
 
A homeowner who brought their property 50 years ago for $7,000.00 and have been paying taxes in the community for 50 years should not have to pay for an appraised value of their property, especially if they never sell their home. I wonder how senior citizens on fixed incomes can afford to pay an increasing appraised tax bill each year on a fixed income?
 
Who's idea was this?  Do you think its fair?  I would think it would be a lot easier for the government to figure what they would be collecting each year for property taxes if each person paid the same percentage on the purchase price of the home.  I dont mind paying taxes on something I buy, but I do mind being taxed on something that's not real.  The reality is my home is worth $45,000.00 because that's what I paid for it.
 
In the next couple years the banks are going to be crashing because people were so stupid the last couple of years and over extended themselves on property they are not going to be able to afford in the future.  The government sending them bills for appraised value and not real value is going to play a big part in this in the future.  
 
I have never written a government official in the past, but I have seen you on tv and you seem to have compassion and know the difference between right and wrong. Is there anything you can do to fix a problem that is hurting thousands of floridians?
 
I don't know if I will get a response, so I will thank you in advance for taking the time to read this and give my thoughts possible consideration.
 
Blessings to you and your family during the holiday seasons and always.

Subject:	Potential Property Tax Solution

Dear Governor Bush,
 
The property tax issue in Florida has been weighing on my mind, as I am sure it has yours.  As I was thinking through possible solutions, the thought came to me that we have capped the wrong variable under the current system.  Allow me to explain.
 
Currently we cap the amount of appreciated value that can be taxed until the property changes hands (I know I am simplifying this greatly).  When the property changes hands the full market value is then taxed.  Therefore, there is a step function increase in property tax revenue from that property as it changes ownership.  Since there is a certain amount of property turnover during the year (someone told me once that the US average is every 5 years) for some percentage of the property market the taxing authority gets a windfall.  If no one sold their homes and there were no new building during a year, the tax revenue would increase by the amount of the tax cap (I'm not sure what it is -- 3%?).
 
The potential solution is to have the property assessed at fair market value BUT have the cap placed upon how much tax the taxing entity can receive.  For example, the cap could be inflation plus rate of growth (for new property construction).  This would allow revenue to be extracted for services needed to support a larger population base while limiting the amount of increase levied on existing property.  Just because a property changes hands does not mean that the level of services required by that property has increased.  Therefore, as property increased in value, the rate at which it is taxed would decrease.  The formula could work so that there would be enough tax collected from the new property to cover the growth rate and existing property would be taxed at a rate not to exceed some legislated level (CPI, for example).  If incremental tax would be needed to cover something unusual, a special vote could take place to temporarily increase the rate to cover the extraordinary expense.
 
Thanks for all your hard work and for caring about Florida.
 
All the best,

Subject:	Personal Attention Gov. Jeb Bush


Dear Govenor Bush,
 
Regarding a story today November 30 2006 "Tourism Outlook Not All That Sunny"
St Petersburg Times November 30 2006 Business Section
 
I am a member of the Florida Superior Small Lodgings. The SSL consists of a group of vacation rental owner operators dedicated to maintaining high standards for small lodgings. Our guests for the most part are middle income families.
 
The folks at FLA USA and Visit Florida seem not to have got the full picture regarding the reasons for the downturn of tourism in Florida.
It is not rocket science. It is old down home, grass roots common sense.
 
Florida is a hostile environment for the tourist industry. 
 
As an owner of vacation rental condominiums I have seen the TAXES on a one bedroom St. Petersburg vacation rental condominium rise from $1146.64 in 2000 to $4350.21 in 2006.
 
1. This is an increase of 280%.
2. Taxes have gone from 8% of my overhead to 30% of  
    overhead!
3.  Add to this the sky rocketing cost of insurance and you 
    will quickly see that tourism in Florida is in dire straights.
4. Businesses must raise rates to reflect this increase. This 
    is not  always possible in a competitive environment as 
    you will see.
5. No business can consistently raise prices this steeply 
   and not have a consumer  backlash.
   That is, no business unless you are in the business of 
   government levying taxes. 
   And today Government is my primary business partner.
 
My silent business partner - who shares in the all of the benefits of my labor and who shares none of the risk, is the state of Florida and Pinellas County.
 
Tourism is our # 1 industry in Florida. But unrestrained government is hauling in our money like pigs at the trough. Biased tax laws are what is strangling the tourist industry as insidiously as citrus canker is devastating the citrus industry.
The difference is that the tourist industry die off is self inflicted. 
 
The looming disaster can be stopped if Government were to return to their budgets of 2000 and limit themselves to Cost of Inflation increases rather than windfall gains.
 
The truism of Civics finance is that government will spend whatever it receives. Each years budget is based on the previous year. If a department does not spend ALL of its budget income, then the following year it may get a reduced allocation. Therefore the incentive of government - unlike the private sector is to SPEND.
 
The property tax structure is akin to a person owning shares in the stock market. You may have bought Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffet) 10 years ago when the stock was $30,000 and today it is over $100,000. A similar 280% increase to that which we have experienced in the property market here in Florida.
 
Imagine if each year you were taxed on those shares even though you have not sold them. And imagine that as your shares go up in value, your tax assessment increases each year based on their current market value.
 
How long do you imagine that you would hold on to those shares?
You would not!
 
You would sell out.
 
More to the point - investors, Wall Street and the Federal Government would be outraged. And rightly so.
It would not be tolerated!
 
We are paying taxes on the value of something (property) whose value or capital gain we have not yet realized. It is only a paper gain until such time as we sell it. We have NOT received the beneficial use of this gain. However we are taxed as if we had.
In fact we are taxed each year on the potential capital gains, not just once - compounded taxation. 
 
Normally a capital gain is only taxed once - and that is upon sale, as in the case of stocks. Not so in the arcane world of property taxes in Florida. 
 
Property taxes in Florida are made more diabolical - because the tax is based on the "highest and best use of the property" as defined by the property appraisers office. Such definitions defy logic. As I recently found out. The appraisers office is unable to define their own standard of what constitutes the "highest and best use of a property."
 
I called Jim Smith Property Appraisers Office about my huge increase in property taxes. I was met with the most cold hearted and callous response from a man in that department.
He dismissed me with the a short comment "If you cannot afford the taxes then perhaps you are in the wrong business!"
 
"Oh?" I replied. "What business did he suggest I should be in?" And he replied, "Well maybe you should be flipping burgers or maybe you have to sell out. Go and sell used cars or something"
 
Perhaps this "Public Servant" has life time job security. I do not. He does not have to worry about providing for his family, medical benefits and a retirement plan. Or "working" for a living. Public servants rarely deal with these concerns.
Perhaps what he should have said to me, is, "Give up the struggle, don't try to earn a living, come and join the wonderful world of public service."
 
I fear that his attitude is not isolated, it is endemic in the Tax Assessors Office and the office of tax collection. It is endemic in our government leaders.
 
This is OUR public money at work!
 
Regarding Florida Tourism. Consider this.
My European business, mainly UK tourists, carry us through the summer months. Traditionally Americans and Canadians do not travel to Florida in the summer months as much as they do in winter.
So in the summer, the entire USA is our competition, whether it is New England, Colorado, the Canadian Rockies and even Alaska. Florida is not a top of the mind destination.
However for Europeans it is. They have 3-6 weeks annual vacation in summer.
 
We compete for those tourist Euros with the likes of the Mediterranean countries, Egypt, Morocco, Spain, Greece, Italy, etc., as well as with more exotic places like Thailand, South Africa and Australia.
 
A UK tourist can get flight and hotel packages - all inclusive, for $700.00 per week AND LESS - to most of the Mediterranean, to Eastern European countries,  and to many Asian destinations.
 
I have seen a huge drop in European travelers.  
 
American travelers have a choice as well. Be it summer or winter. A 7 night cruise with all inclusive fare, meals, travel, entertainment costs about $700.00,
 
Mexico, with its fabulous beaches and great shopping is the same.
 
Other sunshine destinations such as Las Vegas, which you mentioned in your article, has real family appeal. The Carolina beaches are head to head competition with us. So are the Texas beaches.
 
The Caribbean and Central and South America are wonderful bargains. Seven nights in Peru, Machu Picchu, Amazon rain forest, Inca highlights with fully guided tours are $800.00 airfare included!
 
I am in what is considered a moderate price range for Florida.
This week I have turned away several inquiries for Christmas lodging because folks were turned off by the cost. Perhaps I need to cut prices in the face of rising costs?
 
Our taxes and our government are killing tourism in Florida as surely as day turns to night.
And a long, cold night it will be.
 
Sincerely,
 
Jeffrey Solomon

I am writing you to let you know that the tax structure in Florida is abominable and needs to be overhauled in order for it to be equitable for all citizens.  I am a retired special ed school teacher 63 years old and my husband and I purchased a condo in St Pete.  We are going to have to sell our place because our taxes are over 5000 dollars and our insurance is over 800 dollars. I am a representative of what is to come here in florida .  I feel that people who purchased without homestead are being unfairly penalized for coming here, I tell you that if I have to sell because Florida politicians are ignoring us I will never spend any more of my time or money in Florida .  I will buy in a state that wants retirees and doesn't try to use them to support the state.  I only use your services 6 months of the year and do not add to your tax burden with using the educational system etc.  I cannot believe that this is happening here.
 
I tell you if you do not adjust the real estate tax laws you will need homestead laws because people will not want to buy here!

Dear Mr. Bush, 

 

Please let me know why you would create a committee to meet today in Orlando to help “come up with potential solutions for giving relief to property owners”  regarding property taxes that would not be required to give a final report until the end of next year?  Are you kidding?  Is this our government at its best?   This is an immediate problem for the State of Florida that needs to be resolved.   

 

My last twenty years have been spent doing real estate closings in the State of California, and Florida.   I have not seen our market any slower than it is now, and it is primarily due to overwhelming taxes and property insurance in this state.    For many years people would move to “retire” to Florida or purchase their second home here.   Seniors on a fixed income can no longer afford to live here, some paying and additional $300.00 to $500.00 a month for taxes and insurance.  Younger families cannot afford it either.  Last year at this time I was closing 50-75 new purchases and refinances a month, this month I closed 25.  

 

Government needs to consider the fact that many people in the real estate and title and banking industry are losing their jobs due to this OVERWHELMING problem.   Please let me know who it is in your committee that is representing us.   It is not just affecting those who pay the property taxes it is affecting ALL OF US IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.   I have spoken with people all over the state, and in fact an attorney in New York just today who agrees with me.  

 

So, when I ask are you kidding?? One year??  Should I just let my children know after I lose my job to wait a year, and then they can eat again? Or have a roof over their head?   How many of us will end up in unemployment?  Who will pay my high property taxes then?   The government?

 

We need to generate our economy, and entice people to move here again.  With the bad rap we got from the hurricanes, not to mention insurance hikes and property taxes Florida is looking like the last place anyone can afford to live.

 

This committee needs to come up with a solution NOW, not next year.  I will be more than happy to participate in any way possible to get this to happen, so please let me know if a spot opens up.   I think the 15-member committee should put their heads together and get this resolved by January, and lower our 2007 property taxes.

 

 

Sincerely,

I received your office's response - thank you.
 
Another week has passed with no income for my office.  If this continues, I will have a hard time making ends meet.  Other people depend on me.  My staff needs to be paid too.  
 
I wonder how in the world the State of Florida thinks that this delay is in any way helpful to our Dependency system.  We claim to "care" about the children in the "system", yet we are tying the hands of those that care to help them.
 
I just don't understand why you haven't taken the appropriate steps to protect the Dependency system.  I am told that the release of funds only requires your signature.
 
Won't you please sign it today?
 
I would be more than happy to help the State in determining effective means of reducing costs in the future and I remain comitted to the children of Florida.

To Governor. Bush,
I am writing as a retired home owner tax payer and American.  I am very upset about what is happening in Florida as to taxes that are out of this world. My husband and I bought a condo in St Petersburg, two years ago, because we loved the area and wanted to be out of the cold winters in NY. This year our taxes are over 5,000 dollars and our insurance is over 700 dollars.  This is too much, we live here for six months and only use your states services for six months and do not use your educational system.  
 
 
I feel that Florida's tax codes are outdated.  We cannot homestead and are paying for it in a big way.  I really believe that Florida must update its tax code or you will see the biggest migration of retirees from this state and a glut of homes for sale.  I love being here but I am not stupid.  It would be cheaper for me to rent and that is probably what I will have to do.
This has made me very sad because I thought that life would have been good here. But I think the politicians are getting very greedy.
 
I am hoping that there is something that you and your legislature can do to alleviate this tax burden. It is inequitable!!
 
Another problem is the insurance premium for citizens I am paying over 700 dollars and they are saying that it will double next year, this is intollerable.

Dear Jeb:
 
Your term is now about to end and before you leave I want to thank you sincerely for your promise and fulfilling this promise that you would do away with the INTANGIBLES TAX. This was a tax that the old line liberal Democrats cooked up several years ago to hurt those who had saved their money and bought stocks and bonds for retirement. They really hurt investors in Florida but you ushered in a new day by eliminating this tax.  It was unfair and made many move to states that did not have this tax or simply find other ways to shelter their assets.
 
You have had a very good term as governor and I wish you could serve another four years. Many thanks for your service to the State and I wish you the very best for your life outside of government. I hope you will consider running for President in the future. 
 
Many thanks.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to complain about our property taxes.

We bought our home at 7925 Broadmoor Pines Blvd., Sarasota, 43243 in 2000.  We have a Sarasota mailing address, but we're actually in Manatee County.  We are NOT "Homesteaded."  As a result, under Florida's unfair and unequal tax rules, we are discriminated against.  Is there another state in the Union that has such an unfair tax law?

Our neighbors to both sides of us are Homesteaded.  They live in basically the same house we live in, with the same size yard.  But, their taxes are thousands of dollars less than ours!  

Is this even legal?  It sure as heck isn't fair!

Even though the local and national media have been covering the bursting real estate bubble for more than a year, our taxes have just gone up another 18.5%.  Since we bought our home, back in 2000, our taxes have more than doubled, and they were not low to begin with!

I am assuming that if there is any justice in our government that our taxes next year, with overwhelming evidence of lower home prices, will go DOWN, significantly so.  

I would love to get you opinion on this subject. 

Pretty soon, I predict Florida isn't going to be the wonderful retirement spot it's been for the past twenty years.  Government is going to tax itself into making Florida a pretty ugly state in which to live.  And, if Florida, as some knowledgeable researchers are already beginning to predict, doesn't attract the upcoming bubble of Baby Boomers, the glory days may truly end.  

I know you will probably never see this email, but I hope it goes to someone who will read it and seriously consider the comments and questions I've posed, and respond thoughtfully to it.  A "canned" answer is not a thoughtful answer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to you to ask you to continue to consider the impact a 3rd Children's Hospital would have on our community.  I am a volunteer at Florida Children's Hospital and I see first hand the wonderful job they are doing for our community.  Florida Children's Hospital has been serving the families of Central Florida for almost 100 years.  They too treat many children who can not pay for their care.  Nemours keep running on the platform that "no child will be turned away".  Please let the leadership of either FCH or Arnold Palmer tell you the number of children they treated last year "gratis".  Both of these hospitals treat children with chronic illnesses just as Nemours says they will.  With the nursing shortage in our state and others, certainly Nemours will be the demise of one or both of our already established hospitals.  I fear it will be Florida Children's Hospital.  Nemours wants to bring several million dollars to Orlando and build their hospital.  I am positive that Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional have contributed in the billions.  Please consider these points today.
Thank you for your time and service to our community.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I would first like to say as a lifetime resident of this state we have never enjoyed the prosperity, growth, or leadership that we have during your tenure.  As I said, I am a native of this great state, residing here in Northwest Florida.  I am a member of the Florida Bar and own and operate a small law firm here in Pensacola, Florida.  A large portion of our revenue comes from performing Court Appointed Conflict work.  To date, this has been a great marriage between myself and the State and one I hope continues for a long time.  This why I was and am so alarmed by the bulletin located on the Justice Administration Commission's website addressed to Court Appointed Counsel.  The bulletin simply reads that the JAC has exhausted their allotted funding for the year and are awaiting an emergency disbursement of funds.  So until further notice attorneys will not be paid.  I understand the situation, however, I do not see how I am not entitled to an answer as to when I can expect this to be resolved (especially when considering the amount owed).  These are funds that have been earned and counted on by this firm.  As you are aware, this is the holiday season making this the worst possible time for such a situation.  Thank you in advance for your efforts and have a blessed holiday season.

I have no representation in the sate legislature, or on the Broward County tax boards.  I cannot vote.  NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.  This is un-American and we fought a revolution over this issue.

 

I use few of the services provided by Broward County, or the State of Florida, yet I pay for each and every one of them.  I am subsidizing others.  The bill I paid represents a tax of five times as much as what my neighbor pays and yet we have identical condos.  Something is wrong.  This is unfair.

Dear Governor Bush:
         This is the first time I have contacted a government official anywhere for anything but a drivers license, or some similar common question.  The state of Florida has a big problem in the long run with the new property assessments creating huge property tax increases in most developing areas of the state.  I am a snowbird, a 62 year old with a 57 year old wife, both retired and living 8 months a year in Maryland.  We own an RV lot in Naples, purchased in 2004 for $86000, with taxes paid that year of about $700.  We spend a considerable amount of money in the 3 or 4 months a year we spend in Florida.  I just paid my current tax of $1462.  That is an increase of more than 100% in 2 years.  This is for a 35' x 70' lot with a smaller cement pad on it.  Yes, we have electric, water, sewer, and cable, but pay separately for that.  If the assessments keep going up, as I believe they will, as there is only limited amount of land to build on in certain areas, the new taxes will force us to find another spot to place our motorhome and spend our $$ during future winters.  
        I cannot vote in Florida as I am not , and cannot become a resident, so all I can do is contact folks in government throughout Florida, and plead with them to see the unfairness of this system.  And besides,  where are all the new taxes going.  Collier County must be flooded with new tax infusions, and searching for places to spend it.  Please do not let the snowbirds be chased away.

New residents like us are being crippled by taxes which mount to a staggering $600 a month for a 1700 SF match box while other residents are only paying a fraction of the cost. I am not speaking about retirees but, thousands upon thousands of working people who earn a lot more than we earn. Add that to the punishing homeowners insurance and you have a County with a sagging home market and the local economy that is stumbling. To top it off a big percentage of home owners on our street only pay ¼ of the taxes we pay, while several of those people reside elsewhere. This area can not continue impose such a burden on a portion potential new residents and expect to flourish. No one will buy homes here when they find out the penalties of ownership in this State/County. We were under the impression that our taxes were to remain the same when we purchased our home. We had no idea we were under the previous home owner’s homestead umbrella and would be paying double the taxes at the turn of the year. Otherwise, or we would have never bought in this State. Someone should be accountable for misleading us! We can’t even sell our home at this point without loosing everything. On the other hand we can not afford these ridiculous taxes either. Why is Volusia County the third highest taxed county in Florida anyway? How could anyone justify the high taxes in an area salaries and benefits are horrible. Hasn’t the County collected enough in recent closings and the additional gas tax they impose on us at a time when oil prices have never been higher. The local government in Volusia is completely out of touch with the people and need to be removed from office. Something is wrong when you feed the county and it bites your hand! It needs to be put to sleep!!

Mr. Bush,
My name is Meghan Ward, and I am currently a freshman at the University of

my English class we were assigned a paper where we had to investigate a 
topic we find to be a social injustice, and I chose how little teachers 
are paid as mine. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering a few 
questions that I had. 1. Since you have been in office have you done 
anything to increase teacher's salaries? 2. Where do you stand on the 
issue of teacher salaries? Do you think they are underpaid? 3. What do you 
propose should be done? Florida is one of the lowering paying states and 
it is a discrace. Teachers are the ones who are educating future 
generations and many can barely live off what they make. I thank you in 
advance for your time.

OFFICE DEPOT GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS EXPANSION ANNOUNCED

On Monday, I applauded the announcement by Office Depot to build a new
corporate headquarters facility in Boca Raton. With the expansion of this
business unit, the Florida-founded Office Depot expects to create 430 new
jobs and invest at least $210 million in facility construction ($180
million) and new equipment ($30 million). I am honored to recognize Office
Depot's longtime commitment to Florida, the state where it first established
roots in 1986. While this fine global corporate headquarters would be
welcomed anywhere, I am distinctly proud Office Depot chose South Florida to
foster its future success. We greatly value the company's presence, economic
contributions, and corporate citizenship, and I look forward to its ongoing
success in the Sunshine State. Office Depot opened its first store in Fort
Lauderdale in October, 1986. Today, Office Depot is a Fortune 150 Company
with annual sales of nearly $15 billion and 50,000 associates around the
world. My Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development worked with
the Palm Beach County Business Development Board and Enterprise Florida,
Inc., to encourage this important expansion project in South Florida. For

FLORIDA COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT TESTS RELEASED

Also on Monday, Florida Department of Education Commissioner John L. Winn
and I announced the release of eight Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests
(FCAT). The reading and mathematics tests are actual tests taken by students
in 2006 and are no longer in use. The reading and mathematics tests for
grades 3, 7, 9, and 10 are available in two formats - one which can be
downloaded, and a new, interactive version that allows you to take the test
and get results online. The Department of Education began releasing
full-length FCAT tests last year, starting with grades 4, 8 and 10 reading
and mathematics tests. The release of the Grade 3, 7, 9, and 10 tests
enhances the educational resources for students and parents to better
understand the FCAT. I am thankful to all of the Florida educators who help
develop and review appropriate test questions. As a result of their
commitment, the State continues to take steps toward increasing the
transparency of the FCAT. Test questions are written according to specific
guidelines developed by Florida educators. Questions are reviewed and
revised by teachers, curriculum experts and school and district
administrators to ensure they are appropriate for the grade level tested.
Each year, more than 500 classroom teachers, special education teachers,
English language learning instructors, administrators, curriculum
specialists, policy leaders, college and university experts, school board
members and parents take part in the FCAT question review process. The 2005

Dear Sir,
I'm requesting you make an emergency rule for those of us in misplaced homes due to the 2004 hurricanes are able to forward our homestead to help get us relocated.
I am in a FEMA trailer today, I am sixty five years of age and limited income.  I did/do have a home business that is less then suitable for income with my living in a fema trailer.
 I have lived on my property since 1991 and  thought I'd die here on the Orchid Island but does not seem to be this way for I do not or cannot afford to rebuild a new home or bring the home I had up to code since the high inflation.
I also seem to be stuck with not affording the move to another area with such hike of real estate taxes.  I think I might be able to do this for my property is inflated to a point that I could sell just my land and buy elsewhere.
 
I was participant in the city's HAZERDOUS MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM and this grant was not successful for any applicants here in the city.  The city officials giving me another year to bring my house up to code which cost as much to do this as building a new house.
a contractor comes here and all they see is building a new house on the island not for me and thus hike the price as though I'm flipping my home. 
 
Thanks to a non profit here in Vero Beach I am safe in my FEMA trailer till I rebuild but do not see any means to do this at this time and really am willing to move if I have my SAVE MY HOMES homestead forward.,
 
I also cannot afford the insurance so I do have to sell my space that was once my home.  Florida will end with all wealthy for retired with very limited income will not afford this high expense of real estate taxes, insurance etc..etc. but then, I think your aware of this.
 
I hope you can assist those of us that are on our third year out of our homes due to the National Disaster 2004 hurricanes Francis and Jeanie.
 
Thank  you, 
Respectfully,
Cherane Pefley

Hello Governor Bush,
       The current property tax situation is out of control. People are getting taxed out of their homes and new home owners cannot afford to buy an average sized home. I have started to see young families have to live with one or two roommates to make due with their mortgage vs. their incomes. Not to mention increases in insurance premiums aswell. Something has to change soon. I have been hearing rumors about property tax corrections that would lower property taxes. Is there any truth to this? 
 
                                                                                      Concerned homeowner

I cannot find any information on the my florida web page relating to the commission established to study the problems with property taxes in Florida.  Please direct me to the proper web page so I can send comments to the commission.  This is a far more serious problem for Florida than homeowner's insurance, yet I see nothing under hot topics.  
 
As a full time resident, you would think I would like the current unfair system which transfers the tax burden to people who don't vote (snow birds) or residents who choose to move.  However, it didn't work for us.  We are taxed out of our new home because it took 4 years to build and land vaulations escalated due to one or two land speculators.  I can only see an economic down turn in Florida if the second home buyer goes elswhere and citizens are unable to move up in housing without shouldering an unfair portion of the tax burden.  Transporting those exemptions just shifts the burden more.  We need real reform and real accountability at the local level for spending.
 
Where is the website or address for the commission studying this problem?

Subject:	Real estate taxes in Florida

First - good luck in whatever you do after your term ends.
I'm including in the body of this email the text of a letter I emailed to Highlands County. As a non-voting part time resident I feel I am being royally screwed (taxation without representation). I hope that the "noise" coming through the press is more than just "noise." The real estate taxes are just plain unfair. 
 
Dear Mr. Bryan,
I know you are merely the messenger (collector of taxes) but I need to vent my displeasure with the county taxing methods for Highlands county and all of Florida.
A few months ago I got my notice of assessed value change and of course was not real surprised that it had increased (though 33% seemed onerous). I did not complain at that time because I “assumed” that the millage rate would decrease significantly. And if I complained I would have had to attend a hearing in Sebring while I was still in Illinois. 
Much to my chagrin the millage rate only decreased by a modest amount (about 6% overall). What in the world are the taxing bodies going to do with this “windfall?” If private enterprise did this the government would take it away as a “windfall profits tax.”
In any case, I am doubly screwed because 1) I am a legal resident of Illinois , thus taxed on a higher assessed value than similar property owned by Florida residents (my increase is 33% and theirs is 3%) and
2) I cannot vote out the rascals that allowed such inequities to occur.
Lest Florida forgets, we snowbirds contribute a lot of dollars to the local economies. And though we do put demands on the infrastructure we don’t bring school kids (40% of the bill). And that is only a small part of the story with regards to our demands for services of local government - after all most of us are only here half the year. Do you want us to leave? Along with the ridiculous insurance costs we are faced with unfair government taxation. If something is not done to relieve this UNFAIR burden we can and will find other warm winter locations.
There has been much in the news lately about real estate tax inequities. How about a sales tax that hits everyone equally (with provisions for low income people - for example no tax on life necessities). I realize this is a “statewide” problem. HELP!
Very truly yours,

To Governor Bush
 
I am a Court Appointed Counsel in the sixth judicial circuit, and as you  know all funds provided to pay counsel were exhausted in this month. This is an  urgent problem as  funding was halted suddenly. Warning or notice was with held.  This lack of notice has created a terrible situation for many of us and I sure can relate to those persons who suffered from the ENRON debacle.
 
My home insurance has gone up two thousand dollars this year, and I live in a very small home in a middle class neighborhood. Please help us with some emergency funding so that we can make it through Christmas and the New Year.
 
I am enjoy representing the persons that cannot afford counsel but needless to say am forced to re evaluate my options due to the utter disregard of  our services by State Government. 
 
In sum I hope your office can do something for us in the way of emergency funding. We certainly are on notice now as what to plan or expect regarding state funding. I do believe that if your office can help us as you did during the hurricanes, I for one will continue to support you efforts when you run for office at a future time.  
 
I am the single support of my household and this  two children and this is my only source of income.  
 
I have supported your role as governor since you have taken office and ask you to provide  emergency funding so that we can at least pay our bills.
 
Certainly this failure of this  government to pay bills in a reasonable time frame is a  warning  that is not to be ignored. This particular situation  causes great harm especially to those of us who have no reserves.  
 
I realize you have been made aware of this by members of the Florida Bar and of the Judiciary, but I as an average citizen am writing to you individually as this abrupt lack of funding  cause a great deal of hardship to myself and others in my catagory. As Court Appointed Counsel I  work many hours for my  clients and recieve a much lower pay for the amount of services performed, as compared to attorney's that have developed private practices.

Governor Bush, 

Per the Orlando Sentinel, $270 Tax Windfall in 

Orange County------$113 Million 
Polk County ---------$43 Million 
Seminole County---$35 Million 
Osceola County-----$28 Million 
Lake County--------- $23.1 Million 
Brevard County----- $20 Million 
Volusia County------$6.4 Million 

I do not understand how we have such a windfall of taxes in the State of Florida, when any Property Tax Appraiser's site clearly states the following:


HOW QUICK ARE THESE TAXES GOING TO BE ROLLED BACK TO THE CONSUMER, AS THE BELOW LAW STATES THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO? 


Tax Limitations on County Commission and Cities 

By special act of the Florida Legislature (Laws of Florida Chapter 74-430 House Bill No. 4173), municipal taxing authorities are limited to a maximum 10% increase in the amount of revenue that can be raised in comparison to the prior year. A March 1996 Charter Amendment referendum limited the Board of County Commissioner's ability to increase revenues over the preceding year for operating funds to 3% or the change in the consumer price index, whichever is less. 

taxauth.asp" \l "Contents: taxauth.asp" \l "Contents:The Millage Rates of the Taxing Authorities 

When the total taxable value (the total assessed value of all individual properties in the County added together after exemptions) of the tax roll increases from one year to the next year, the Taxing Authorities (County Commission, Municipalities, School Board, etc.) are required by State Law to begin their budget with a roll-back of the millage rate to a rate which will generate the same revenue as in the previous year; reference hypothetical Example of Annual Roll-back Procedure below.

The Property Appraiser is responsible for certifying to each Taxing Authority the annual taxable value. Each Taxing Authority then must compute a roll-up or a roll-back millage rate and a proposed millage. The "roll-back millage" rate is the millage rate, or tax rate that the Taxing Authorities must use as a basis for computing any increase in their annual budgets. Usually, this millage rate is lower than the preceding year's tax rate, because as a general rule, there is usually an increase in the tax base each year sufficient to allow for a millage roll-back. The value increase in the tax base is due to re-assessments and new construction in the prior year. However, new construction is not permitted by Florida Law to be used to calculate the roll-back millage. If the total taxable value (as defined) decreases, the Taxing Authorities are entitled to an upward change of the "roll-back" in the tax millage rate in order to maintain the same level of revenue as the preceding year as the starting point for any budget increases. 

The term "roll-back" is used to describe the economic conditions of total taxable value in the prior year and the amount of monies raised by ad-valorem taxes. It does not relate to the rate of change in the millage. 

With the millage roll-back rate, the Taxing Authorities will realize exactly the same amount of revenue as the preceding year. If they decide to raise the millage rate above the roll-back rate, it usually means that the cost of government operations has increased, or that new public service programs have been added to their budgets. The effect of the millage roll-back on your property taxes will appear on your "Truth In Millage Notice" (TRIM) each year in Column 3. By referring to your Notice, you will also note that Column 1 indicates the previous year's taxes and Column 2 indicates the proposed increase or decrease in tax dollars if the proposed budget is adopted. An example of this calculation is given below. The tax millages for 1999 are also listed below the example of the annual roll back procedure table. Clicking on the Millage Code will present the user with the specific millage rates by each taxing authority.

EXAMPLE
HOW TAXING AUTHORITIES CAN HIDE TAX INCREASES BY IGNORING THE
ROLLBACK MILLAGE RATE

PROPERTY APPRAISER
Determines Tax Base             TAXING AUTHORITY
Sets Budget, Tax Rate & Levies Tax                     
TOTAL TAXABLE VALUE                     TAX RATE        REVENUE
YEAR 1  $12,000,000,000         7.000 MILLS     $84,000,000    
YEAR 2  $14,000,000,000 ROLLBACK        6.000 MILLS     $84,000,000    
YEAR 2  $14,000,000,000 ADOPT 10%
TAX INCREASE    6.600 MILLS *   $92,400,000    


* TELL TAXPAYERS THEY REDUCED THEIR TAX RATE FROM 7.00 TO 6.60 MILLS BUT THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE TAXES. 
Detailed Example Explanation 

In this example, "Year 1" reflects a $12 billion dollar tax base (established by the Property Appraiser) times a 7 mill tax rate, (tax rate set by taxing authority) providing the taxing authority $84 million dollars in revenue. The subsequent, "Year 2", reflects a $14 billion dollar tax base times the required rollback rate of 6 mills to again provide the taxing authority $84 million dollars in revenue. Should the taxing authority adopt a 10% tax increase, as displayed in the above chart, total revenues reach 92.4 million dollars. This represents an increase in taxes of $8.4 million dollars even though the tax millage rate was reduced from the prior year. 


I look forward to your response.

Governor Bush,

Something has to be done about the high property taxes in the State of 
Florida(Highlands County). In Highlands County they have skyrocketed 
over the last few years and it is all about how much money the County 
and City of Sebring can accumulate for their own war chest of special 
interest or their huge salaries. The Salaries that some of these elected 
or appointed officials is just outrageous. For example, our county 
administrator makes only about $30,000-$40,000 less than the 
Hillsbourough administrator makes. Our county is probably 1/3 or less 
the size of that county.

In lots of the northern states, as well as, some southern states access 
there properties at 60%, not 80% as Florida now does. Something must be 
done soon. I am a full time resident of Florida, not a seasonal resident 
and I am seeing many of my neighbors and people I have met over the 14 
years I have lived here moving away from Florida because they can not 
afford the taxes in this county of Florida.

I would like to discuss this matter with someone at the State level, but 
do not know who to contact. I was hoping my email to you would get 
something started to get this situation under control.

Regards,

Stephen Lord

Things you may not know. We recently received our property insurance renewal from State Farm. I was very surprised that our Windstorm Insurance had not been canceled. However, our Windstorm coverage went up 152%. The policy also included a charge of $150.00 to Citizens Insurance Group. I was told by our agent that in the 1970's Ormond Beach, Daytona Beach and South Daytona chose to become part of a Wind Zone Area. In other words an Insurance company can sell a homeowners policy and not offer Windstorm coverage in these cities. If you live in another city, the Insurance company must offer Windstorm coverage. I was told that anyone who has State Farm will get hit with the increase in Windstorm Coverage if their policy renews after October 10th. I sent this information to the Mayor, my City Councilman and Jeb Bush. The only person I heard from was someone in the governors office and his response was just fluff.  
 
If you review your new Property Tax Bill, you may be in for a surprise. I was expecting to see a 3% increase in the appraised value of our home. It was much higher. I went down to the Property Appraisers Office and was told the following. The appraised value on our house went up more than 3% because we had pulled a permit to replace the pool screen enclosure that was destroyed during the 2004 hurricanes. I was told that the screen enclosure was considered as a new addition and that it increased the value of our house. It did not make any difference that we had to have it, and that it was not an addition to our house. I then asked if everyone who pulled a permit to repair or replace a damaged roof would receive an increase in their Property Taxes. I was told that they would. Something is wrong with this picture.You have damage to your home, you pay a high hurricane deductible, your insurance company raises your rates and your local government raises your taxes to replace something that you need according to law.

Hello,    
 
I recently moved to Florida from the state of Minnesota. I cannot believe the amount of taxes being collected in this state verses Minnesota. We are about to sell a home we purchased 2 years ago and purchase a different, existing home in Hernando county. I would like to know why property taxes go up to almost double when a new owner purchases a home from an existing owner who has already paid impact fees on the existing home. With the amount of insurance people in Florida now have to pay, how can the average middle class family afford to pay taxes and insurance at such a rate as this. How is this calculated? In Minnesota a home tax rate is based on the home value, not on how many times the home has sold. The taxes on the home we are about to purchase will go from $2250 per year for the existing home owner to $3900 for us as the new owner.  I have never heard of anything like this in my life. If this continues it will drive extreme numbers of persons from the state of Florida. I see this as a future disaster for the state due to numerous foreclosures that can almost be predicted which will ultimately cause a collapse of the revenue and growth to the state. Persons wanting to reside in this state are being forced to relocate to other states in order to be able to find affordable housing in the southern region of America. Please, help me to understand how the whole tax is calculated and where the extra tax money a new owner of an existing home in Florida is being spent. It makes NO sense at all to me and I don't think I am the only person in the dark in regard to housing taxes in the state of Florida. This may ultimately cause us to relocate to another state also. Where will Florida receive it's revenue if everyone is forced to move in order to be able to live an average middle class lifestyle? I feel this needs to be addressed immediately to prevent  the predictable downfall of one of Americas most beautiful states. Thank you for your time in this matter.

Dear Governor Bush; 

I urge you to call a special session to deal with the growing crisis in home insurance.  I have no faith in the (insurance dependent) Reform Commission you established to study and come up with a solution.  They obviously have no answers for the people of this state.  You and the legislature have allowed insurance industry to write the law and get us into a fix that will ruin everyone in the state.  Are you so rich you don't notice what has happened?  We are paying huge property tax bills because of the real-estate boom and now are burdened with unimaginable home insurance bills.  We can't sell our property for what we paid for it.  Most people who don't have a mortgage are going without insurance or can't get insurance coverage because no one will write it for an older home.  My mother, in an assisted living facility, experienced a $300 raise in her monthly rent, mostly attributed to rising insurance cost.  That will push her into a nursing home faster.  At the prices for insurance will there be any nursing homes still in business when we need them? 

If you aren't part of a nonpartisan, independent solution to this crisis you will be going out of office leaving a bitter memory in our minds of your years as governor.

Dear Governor Bush:  My friends and I are permanent residents of Florida and are considering upgrading our living status by moving to a new home.  We cannot, however, because our homestead exemption cannot be transferred and the taxes on a move to a new home would be prohibitive.  We believe that the slowing economy and the housing market would be improved if the homestead exemption could be transferred.  Thank you.

All the phone numbers she has  for the Florida Department of Reimbursement are 1-800 0r 1-877.This as you know,means she is often in a waiting line for someone to pick up the phone.This is very expensive for the family as they are already financially stressed.

RE: Property & Casualty Insurance Reform

 

 

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Over the past two years, property insurance rates have dramatically increased – this not

 only affects, as a homeowner, but also as an owner of a timeshare property. Florida 

Law requires that my timeshare owners association insure my timeshare property for full

replacement value, leaving little room for negotiation with the insurance companies or 

reduction in coverage.

 

As a timeshare owner, my concerns with these unprecedented insurance increases include:

 

1.	How does the State of Florida plan on increasing the number of insurance carriers,

Thereby giving timeshare associations more choices with carriers? What can be done to

decrease cost or place reasonable limits on increases in premiums?

                                                                                                                                    

2.	Hurricanes have been a known weather condition in the state for years. Why have the 

Issues of increasing premiums and decreasing number of insurance carriers not been 

addressed before?

 

3.	What can be done to help timeshare and condominium associations take steps to 

Improve their properties and provide better protection from severe storms? How can

Such improvements be taken into account in determining appropriate premiums and 

deductibles?

 

4.	The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Migration Program provides free 

Inspections and grants individual homeowners, but what is being done to help

timeshares, condominiums and businesses?

 

As a time share owner, I appreciate your commitment to protecting the future of Florida’s

Tourism and hospitality industries – and individual owners like myself.

The Honorable Jeb Bush

The Capitol, 400 S. Monroe St.

Dear Governor Bush:

 
Property taxes keep going up each year with no end in sight.

I purchased my condo four years ago and I am now paying roughly five 
thousand dollars more in property taxes. What has happen is the fact that 
similar condo units in my building have been reselling for more money. Yes 
this seems like a great thing, but I didn't buy at these prices and I am 
forced to pay taxes on those assessed values. Like myself, there are 
thousand of homeowners out there that have seen their property taxes 
almost double. The funny thing is that we are not getting any additional 
services for paying more property taxes.  The real winner in all this is 
the government, which gets a wind fall form the increase in property taxes 
while maintaining the same operating budget. This whole property tax 
system is a flaw of the injustice that is occurring year after year to 
homeowners across the state of Florida.  Increases in property taxes 
should not solely be based on higher property values but should have a 
more important significance on the operating budgets that are set for each 
town. This way we can hold our government accountable for any increases in 
their operating budget and limit them to how much more they will need to 
raise our property taxes to support its operation.  

1.Tax the home owner based on what he paid for his property. This way he 
is not affected by similar properties being sold for more money around 
him. This also helps the elderly people and local residents who live on a 
fixed income from increased rents and additional property taxes. 

2. Accountability to keep taxes low.  Force local and county government to 
keep from increasing our property taxes based on operating budgets not 
property values. This way local towns and county governments will compete 
with one another on attracting residents by having lower taxes. 

3. Surpluses in property taxes should be refunded back to the home owners. 
After all it's their money, and government does a poor job of misusing the 
money.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush
The property tax that is levelled on home owners in the state of Florida is unduly high.  If the present situation continues, the state will soon become a welfare state, where the homesteaders will be unable to support the needs of the state and all the non-resident owners will be forced to leave their winter homes.  Mexico and many Caribbean Islands will be a viable alternative, where we are made to feel wanted.  Florida has become a haven to the likes of O.J. Simpson and the unfair homestead property tax homeowners.

       Governor Bush, 


        I may be being simplistic however the issue of fair property taxes seems to me to be very simple. 

           When property values go up, the millage rate goes down and when the property values go down the 
      millage rate goes up.  In this way the taxing agency gets the funding it needs to operate and maybe 
      a little extra to put aside for EMERGENCY PURPOSES ONLY and not to be used for somebody's 
      pet project.  

        These is of course the change in millage rates for changing needs, but I think this would be an 
     easy and equitable solution to stop from destroying Florida's economy and save a lot of homeowners 
     the loss of their home by foreclosure. 

        I hope this reaches you and is not blocked by some road block in your staff or your instructions 
     as to what you want to see from the people of Florida.  I would like to know your thoughts on this 
     solution.

Governor, 
I am a real estate broker and small builder in southwest Florida, and we have an emergency situation.  The property taxes and homeowners insurance premiums are having an extremely adverse affect on sales.  People simply can't qualify.  Please let the governor elect know of this problem that is already costing jobs and will definitely cost him votes in his next election.  Property taxes have doubled and tripled in the area, yet land values have dropped by half in the last year.  Many lots have a tax appraisal of 50 to 60 percent over what they are selling for.  A large share of the property ownership is by absentee owners who use almost none of the services provided by the state of Florida for much of the year, and do not have any children in the local schools -- shouldn't that help keep prop. taxes lower?  Insurance rates and the deductibles have become so high on single family homes, that they are causing second home owners who have been coming here for years to put their houses up for sale. 
Consider this example: 
       A $450,000.00 home on 5 acres, 10 miles inland and no water in site --  The property is worth $250.000.00 so they are really insuring a $200,000.00 home. However since there is a loan for $400,000.00 on the property they must insure for that amount. Their premiums are $6,000.00/yr with a $30,000.00 deductible! )
The number of potential second home buyers in the market have dwindled to almost nothing.  In a very short time this trend will devastate the local economy.  You cannot have taxes double or triple, and insurance premiums go up by 300% in just a few years and not have serious effects on the economy of Florida.

Subject:	Re Property Taxation in Citrus County

 
Governor Bush I am writing this letter to you on behalf of my mother who is 82 years old and on a fixed income. She owns a house in Dunnellon Florida that is in Citrus County.  The situation for her has changed drastically over the course of the last three years.  The valuation of her property has gone from 89,000.00 to 186,000.00 to 364,000.00 in as many years.  I have tried  to contact the Tax Assessors Office in Citrus County and the response has been "that's too bad but everybody's property has gone up in value."  My argument was the sudden increase in value from last year to this year which was 186,000.00 to 364,000.00 which is over a 100% increase in valuation.  This house was purchased by my father for their retirement unfortunately my father died the same week he retired.  My mother decided to keep the house due to the fact all of her grandchildren had stayed there in the summer and they all have the greatest memories of their grandfather and the house on the river.  I am asking you is there anything your office can do to help my mother out?  The whole family is trying to help and my mother only has a certain amount of income.  I know times change but my father fought I WWll as a fighter pilot and he was decorated with the DFC, I know he would want to see this property stay in his childrens and grandchildrens hands.  If you can help us I would greatly appreciate it thank you for time and consideration in this matter.  N H Baldwin jr

Dear Governor Bush,
 
We are in a property tax crisis!  My property taxes went from $1,900 to $6,500 in 1 year. I work thru out the state and  all I hear is people are leaving the state because of property taxes. For sale signs are going up like crazy. The double homestead exemption is a noble idea but will not do very much when the average home is $300,000. The exmption needs to be 1 on the first $100,000 the again on the 2nd $100,000 and another one on the next $100,000.  Foreclosures are on the rise, rent is increasing to meet the tax increase making the snowbirds look elswhere. Florida needs that tourist money.  Everything is effected, food industry, retail markets, building etc. My entire family are native Floridians. Working, being productive in our community and we are going to give this crisis 1 year. Then we are out of here! My daughter is an excellent Biology/ Anatomy teacher and cannot afford her tax increase this year. Something needs to be done now, otherwise it will take many many years for Florida to recoup from this crisis.    Best Regards, Joy Post

Dear Governor Bush,
 
The following is a copy of an email which I sent to all Florida legislators in regard to the proposed $1,000 annual tuition surcharge/fee increase for the University of Florida, approved this week by the Board Of Governors. Inasmuch as this matter will come before the legislature in its 2007 session, and it can dramatically impact the approximate 739,000 families enrolled in the Florida Prepaid College Tuition Plan, as well as those other students qualifying for the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship, it is hoped that it would have your utmost attention.
 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
"As a grandfather sponsering nine grandchildren in the Florida Prepaid College Plan, I was deeply troubled by the Florida Board Of Governors approval of the $1,000 annual tuition surcharge/fee for the University of Florida. My dismay is not with the substance of the increase, but rather its form.
 
Since this matter will come before you during the Florida 2007, legislative session, I implore you to carefully weigh the implications of this method of tuition increase on the approximately 739,000 Florida families currently enrolled in the Prepaid College Plan. 
 
As it is currently approved, this tuition increase would be outside of the scope of the state's tuition funding for the Florida Prepaid College Plan and the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program. In effect, families who need educational financial assistance the most will have to pay this tuition surcharge/fee out-of-pocket.
 
At a time when Florida families are besieged with the financial burdens of - skyrocketing increases in homeowners insurance premiums, spiraling real estate taxes, escalating gasoline prices, trying to recover from the expenses paid personally for Hurricane Insurance Deductibles, and a myriad of other accelerating costs - a vote to approve this type out-of-pocket tuition surcharge/fee payment is politically and socially insentitive and unwise, to say the least.
 
What is further troublesome in this issue is that this tuition surcharge/fee could be expanded to include Florida's ten other universities. How does this make any sense? 
 
If the University of Florida is seeking to enhance its status to be included in the national top ten college/universities listing by getting more money to hire more teachers, why would this have any bearing on the status of Florida's other universities. 
 
It is understandable that the University of Florida would seek to improve its ranking. Accordingly, let any tuition increase be included in the Florida state funded Prepaid College Plan and Bright Futures Scholarship Program. In so doing, it does not violate the original good faith intentions of the State of Florida to provide equal educational opportunities for its less financially privleged citizens.
 
Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
 
Respectfully,

	Have any of you concidered what would happen if the taxes and insurance was raised so high that 7000 
	or even 700.000 families were to be forced out of their homes , because our government officials needed more money 
	to pay the CEO's etc. or pay for lobbyists $280.000 to take the place of elected officals,so they wont have to do thier jobs.
	Just sapose that 700.000 families were forced out of their homes. The mortgage and insurance Co. would have 700.000 
	homes on their hands they could not sell. The Insurance Co. would have to fold. Imagion if a total of $300,000,000,000.00
	of income for the electric, water, waist and business or any other Company that depends on a income.
	My opinion, the Florida families Should refuse to pay the higher tax and insurance rates that are imposed.
	Because our Elected officials are afraid to fight for our rights as American citisans, hell they even send all of our industry out 
	of the country, there for the working man has nothing except low paying jobs to saport the home and family.

Subject:	UK owners are soft targets

Dear Governor Bush
 
It was always my dream to own a Florida property where my family could enjoy all year round sunshine and of course the many parks. Two years ago, I like many Brits purchased my first holiday home in Davenport, and looked forward to visiting at least twice per year.
 
Since then, owning a home in your beautiful state has been an uphill struggle, with extreme difficulty in securing bookings for our villa due to the endless building of new homes, and rates being dragged down to unacceptable levels. General taxes having nearly doubled, and now insurance premiums increasing by 50%.
 
Together with 12% tourist taxes, spiralling power costs, owning our villa is now becoming unattractive for us and many hundreds of Brit owners. You only have to look on some of the website forums to see their dissatisfaction and the belief that non residents are being unfairly targeted.
 
When I purchased my home it was not to make money from rentals, but for somewhere for myself and my family to enjoy. Perhaps when I eventually sell a profit would be realised but now I am not even sure about that. all I wanted to do was to break even and then eventually enjoy a villa by one of your lakes and spend up to six months per year there during my retirement.
 
The Florida authorities need to decide whether you want us Brits as owners in your state or not. I predict that if costs continue to increase as they have been without additional income from our homes being realised then most Brits will pull out within the next five years.
 
 Florida is not an attractive investment anymore, and many will look to put their hard earn pounds into European property, in particular within the eastern block countries.
 
As a supporter of the American way of life I urge the authorities to consider the long term implications of their unfair charges as well as other service providers. I for one will reluctantly look to sell next year and reinvest elsewhere.

Please take action and make a lasting legacy that generations of Floridians will talk about.
 
 
Here is something for you to check into.  All of us who are in the Florida retirement system get great Blue Cross benefits while we are employed.  After we retire we lose about 40-60% or more of our retirement checks to maintain the insurance like blue cross.  The FRS is great but I would like to see a FRHS (Florida Retirement Health System) or something like it put into place that would put the retirees into a group system like the active employees get. As you are aware group plans cost less per person than individual plans. It would help a lot of people that have worked for the state. I watched a man with 30 years with the Department of Corrections retire and his Blue Cross insurance went from $170 per month to over $900.  This means that he can't retire but will have to get another job after he retires just to make ends meet. The Department of Management services could fix this but they are too bottled up with People First problems to pay any attention to this problem.  Please look into this for us.  If a special insurance session is called maybe this can be addressed for action at the regular session.

A bill was introduced by two members of Florida's U.S. House delegation in 2005 to create a national insurance catastrophe fund that would be federally backed and operate as our present flood insurance operates. A fund such as this would be a huge benefit to all Floridians.

 

If the rates get increased again after the Jan 1st 2007 increase on the wind policies from Citizens Insurance, then you can pretty much count on me and a lot of other people that I know moving out of Florida. These increases are unaffordable to the citizens that are blue collar workers and forced to pay them. Good luck on having you car fixed, your garbage picked up, being waited on in the restaurant, getting your lawn mowed and home repairs. I hope you guys know how to fix your own sewer pipe when it breaks. Good Luck.

Good Morning Mr. Bush,
 
Well, as Hurrican season comes close to ending and thank God no hurricanes maybe, South Florida will begin to recover.
 
However, this year its not the Hurricanes its the Insurance Industry that has hit us the taxpayers harder than the Hurricanes.
 
You see my insurance bill has doubled and we are caught between a rock and hard place.  With property values lower, taxes and insurance higher the cost of living in paradise is going thru the roof.  Therefore, we have not been able to sell our home and can't afford to pay the increase of our homeowners insurance.
 
I have written your office several times and called as well.  Everyone transferrs my calls or re-directs me to email a different department.  But, there is no one that can address the issue.
 
I have several questions that I would like answers to not to be redirected to different agencies or departments.
 

1.	If I were to refinance my home from the $240,000.00 on first mortgage and home equity for $80,000.00 ($320,000.00) would my taxes increase?  I have homestead exemption at this time.  There have been rumors that they would and others that it will not.  Looking for a direct answer.
2.	Are there any insurance companies or agencies that will assist those of us that have had our insurance rates go super high and can not afford our current policies for something that is cheaper?  We are being driven out of our home and South Florida.
3.	Where in Florida is it still affordable to live with lower property taxes and insurance rates, while still having large companies where one could find work.  White collar.
4.	Schools - my son just entered 9th grade and having a difficult time adjusting and having trouble with several subjects however, there is no FREE TUTORING available.  As I mentioned we are being forced out and therefore, as a parent I want to help my son but, money determines this.  Southwest Senior High School, Miami, Florida told me that the tutoring they offered has been cancelled due to budget cut-backs.  How is this possible.  Does my son just sit and struggle?  

The American dream of home ownership in South Florida is becoming not a dream but, a nightmare.  Something must be done now!  There are many families just like mine.  We speak of the crime, funny that we don't see the crime in what the insurance industry is doing to us.  What are families making under $40,000.00 suppose to do?
 
There are days I just sit and wonder what will happen to us?  Where will we go?  What can we do?
 
Please do not just hand this email over to someone without addressing my concerns.  I really am at the end of the rope.  We are living from our home equity thus, just getting further into debt without any ray of hope.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.  
 
Concern Taxpayer,

Mortgage rates as low as 4.625% - $150,000 loan for $579 a month. Intro-*Terms

Subject:	Special Session

You can thank most of the state lawmakers for this one: The rate hike is necessary to comply with a provision in the insurance bill they passed in May. The bill requires Citizens to set rates high enough to cover all possible losses from the type of catastrophic storm that could hit once in 70 years.
 
“It’s absolutely preposterous. Who can handle this type of thing?” said Peter Otto, a Bayside resident, who was chased out of Coconut Grove two years ago because of rising property taxes and insurance costs.
 
“Quite frankly, when this becomes too painful for me, I will just leave,” he added. “Atlanta is looking far more attractive now.”
 
The flat increase of almost 56 percent will also apply to another 149,000 homeowners around the state, outside the tri-county area.
 
It will be even worse for about 8,000 small businesses in coastal areas around the state that buy hurricane coverage from Citizens. Their rates will soar an unthinkable 513 percent to 678 percent. That means the average premium for many of these businesses will be well over $20,000.
 
The outsized rate increases aren’t a done deal – just yet.
 
Next month, Citizens’ board of governors needs to give the go-ahead to file the request with state regulators, who could tweak the filing. But since the increases are required for Citizens to comply with state law, it’s unlikely they would be rejected outright.
 
Citizens actuary John Rollins explained Thursday that the increase is due largely to the high cost of reinsurance – the insurance that helps insurers cover their losses after a disaster. The cost of reinsurance has soared in the past year after eight storms hit the state.
 
Citizens buys reinsurance not in the private market but from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which provides a lower rate. However, the new law requires Citizens to calculate its expenses as if it were buying reinsurance at the going market rate.
 
Some lawmakers are dismayed.
 
“This is a ridiculous section of that bill. It should be fixed in a special session,” said state Sen. Rudy Garcia, the Hialeah Republican who chaired the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee during the past two sessions.
 
Garcia said he was always worried about the impact of this requirement on homeowners.
 
However, prospects seem to be dimming fast that legislators will be back to Tallahassee in either early December or January to tackle the state’s insurance crisis.
 
Leaders in both the state House of Representatives and Senate say a consensus is needed before setting a special session, but the call has to be made by Gov. Jeb Bush. And the provision in the new insurance law wasn’t addressed in the 50 recommendations put out Wednesday by a state task force Bush appointed to devise fixes for insurance woes.
 
“This onerous provision alone should be enough to call lawmakers back to Tallahassee,” said Rep. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach.

The above excerpt is from an article that all members of the Florida Assoc. of Realtors received.  I underlined and highlighted specific sections that I believe someone needs to address.  I am sure that you have received numerous emails, letters, and/or phone calls regarding this matter of FLORIDA Homeowners Insurance but I have felt the need to join the conversation.  I do not have the insurance mentioned above but the thought that some lawmakers sent to Tallahassee do not know what they are voting on disturbs me.  According to the article above Mr. Garcia says, “This is a ridiculous section of that bill.  It should be fixed in a special session.”  My question to him would be why was it not addressed before now?  I would also like to ask Mr. Gelber the same question.  I do not know how either of these Reps. voted but I hope that they voted against it.  If it turns out that they voted for the bill then we go back to my original concern which is we have lawmakers showing up to vote on Bills without doing any type of research on the piece of Legislature to which they are voting.  THIS IS INCONCEIEVABLE to me personally but I fear it is happening.  Of course I am not saying the all mighty dollar could not be swaying these votes as well, however, this is not the trust that the RESIDENTS OF FLORIDA sent them to Tallahassee with.  Trust me I realize that votes have and will continue to be bought by corporations and/or lobbyists but when RESIDENTS of an entire state are getting pushed out THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG.  The RESIDENTS OF FLORIDA should be the main concern of every elected official/lawmaker sent to Tallahassee and not the tourists, vacation home owners, corporations, lobbyists and especially the mighty Dollar.  The way of life for a lot of residents hangs in the balance.  The insurance problems of today are not only those of current RESIDENTS but it is keeping even more from living the American Dream --- HOME OWNERSHIP.

Dear Governor Bush, I wish to weigh in on the Insurance Crisis & soon to be Property Tax Crisis. We own a modest home in Pinellas Park, FL 33782. In 3 years our taxes have doubled and our insurance has tripled. Now I hear Citizens policies will likely go up another 80 - 100%. This is all truly unbelievable. We and many others could lose our homes. I will have to try to sell our house & flee Florida but consider this. Since Jan.1, 2006 less than 25% of the homes listed for sale in this subdivision have sold. The rest either expired after 6 months or were withdrawn out of frustration. First, we couldn't afford the insurance & taxes to buy a bigger home. Now, we will be forced to flee the state. 
Florida cannot be well served with people leaving the state, increased foreclosures, and vacant homes. We are only 1 home of many thousands facing this crisis.
 
Please, if you can accomplish anything before you leave office, please do. If not, would you please foreword this to Charlie Crist.
 
I truly believe this is the biggest crisis facing Florida.

Dear Governor Bush, 
I was pleased to find your website.  I have a couple of problems in Florida that you shoud be made aware of.  Please look forward to my correspondence via "snail mail" , as these issues are much too important to address through a only a website.  
The first problem is with my house in Cape Coral.  It is as small as a 3/2 rambler can get.  Last year the taxes were 4700.00 That is alot.  This year they are 7200.00 !!! that is more than some people pay in rent.  Is the government trying to chase out all the retired people?? Who can afford that kind of money?  Lots of houses are for sale in our neighborhood because the taxes have gone up so much, people just can't afford to live there anymore.  Please do something.  This Crist fella, or whatever his name is says he's so into lowering the land taxes... but you could do it now.  Please save our homes.  We really were looking forward to retiring there.  It will be impossible at this rate.

Mr. Jeb Bush,

Governor of Florida

Tallahassee, FL 32399-1050 

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in your Property Tax Rally in Tampa today as I will be busy at work.

 

I am writing to you because our Florida dream has become our Florida nightmare. As we approach retirement age, Hillsborough County property taxes are in the process of destroying our lives.

 

During the hurricane seasons of the last two years, Attorney General Charlie Crist took a very strong stance on the prosecution of opportunistic gougers of every ilk. Well, the Hillsborough County Property Assessor's office is effectively gouging property owners and we need yours and his protection from the Property Assessor and the people that run that agency. 

 

We lived in Bradenton in Manatee County for 14 years. When our younger son graduated from high school and went away to college, we made the move to Hillsborough County in order to be closer to our jobs. I had been commuting an hour and a quarter in each direction to North Tampa for 7 years to care for patients at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital. My wife had been commuting to Ruskin where she has been working at a migrant care clinic for 16 years. We'd had enough of the expense of the commuting and the toll it took on our cars, our pocketbooks and our physical health. 

 

In 2001, we purchased 3.24 acres in Hillsborough County; while the previous owner had paid $14,900.00 for the property, we paid her $35,000.00 for the land. This was all we could afford and, although we thought the property to be overpriced as it was, this was the most we were willing to pay for the property. 

 

Our first taxes were based on an assessment of $34,400.00. In no time at all, the property was re-assessed at $55, 000.00. Then re-assessed again at $144,180.00. With our home  completed, the total assessment is $364,980.00. Last year our tax bill was $2,000.00 – tough for us, but still manageable. Taxes this year? Quadrupled to $8, 000.00!!! This is reprehensible and totally without conscience on the part of the local government.

 

To begin with, just because the Property Assessor thinks a property is worth much doesn't necessarily make it so. There are many, many houses and properties in our area that have languished on the market for more than a year and have still not sold. Who in their right mind will pay me $144, 180.00 for my land? Who will pay for my house what the Property Assessor thinks the house is worth? Who in their right mind would even consider buying my property when the tax bill is $8,000.00 a year. NOBODY!!! 

 

The housing market has declined and the consequence of this is that we are not able to sell our property and find another place to live at a price we can afford. We are stuck here. And if we are not able to meet this $8,000.00 tax burden, I am certain that the Hillsborough County Property Assessor will gleefully swoop down, take our home from us and cast us into the street without a second thought. I never thought that I would have to fear my government; but at this point, my local government terrifies me at the thought of how easily it can ruin my life. 

 

How are we going to manage such a tax burden in our retirement years? How will we survive? At this point, it appears that after working a lifetime, we will never be able to retire and that we will be working until the day we die. It was our dream to live our remaining years in peace and leave our house and property to our children and grandchildren for them to live in – but that dream has now been dashed to pieces.

 

As it is, we are paying a mortgage of $24,000 a year. The additional $8,000.00 a year in taxes is more than we can bear. We are in the process of borrowing the $8, 000.00 to pay our current tax bill. During the coming year, we will have to repay this $8,000.00 and somehow also find a way to raise an additional $8,000.00 for next year's taxes. What are we going to do?

 

Over the next ten years, Hillsborough County will have taken $80,000.00 from us. This is money that we could put toward our mortgage to pay our house off and make our old age less difficult. This is money that could help us in our retirement and the medical demands that are sure to come. Both my wife and I have medical conditions that require numerous medications to keep us going. My wife is at a point where she may not be able to work more than another year due to her medical problems. 

 

Governor Bush, what can you do for us and all the other people who are in our position? Who else in government will help to right this abominable situation? Why can't there be a $2,000.00  or $3,000.00 cap on property taxes, no matter what the county thinks a property is worth? Why can't government live within its means and why must we continue to shoulder the burden of government growth running amuck and government spending that is completely out of control? 

 

Mr. Crist said in his political ads that he understands, that it's our money – but it’s not just our money the county government is taking – they are also taking away our future and destroying our very lives in the process. 

 

Very truly yours, Angel Luis Rivera

Dear Governor Bush,
 
We desperately need your help.  Before you leave office, we all need a special Legislative secession to resolve this disastrous Home Insurance situation here in Florida.  We can't afford to wait to see what the next governor has in mine.  With the increase in both Property Taxes and Home Insurance, many homeowners can't stay here any more and nobody can afford to buy our homes either.  My husband and I planned for a very long time to retire here to Florida and invested most of our savings to build a lovely new home in Palm Harbor in a wonderful community and we have many friends here.  With the very real threat of Bankruptcy on the horizon if insurance companies can't be persuaded to offer realistic policies to homeowners with mortgages, we face a bleak future and many other people we know are in the same situation.
 
Please do something to get this mess under control before you leave office so that our future looks as bright and beautiful as most days here in Florida.  Thank you for your consideration and we wish you the very best in your future endeavors.

Subject:	Charlie Crist's Prescription To Keep Florida Healthy:

I have read the Charlie Crist, Governor Prescription to Keep Florida Healthy and I am a State worker, Floridian, and a member of the Republican Party who has supported both governors.  I am an advocate and support every effort that has been accomplished by Governor Jeb Bush, and to continue these and other plans by Governor Charlie Crist who plans for improving and continuing this process.

I would like to request in the planning that the following health care proposal be considered.  This is concerning thousands of State Workers Health Care after many years of service that makes it almost impossible to afford health care once you retire.  Many state workers are forced to work at least until 65 years of age to go on Medicare or work until they are deceased, and many go with out insurance coverage.  It would seem that since the State of Florida currently has insurance plans that provide insurance for the thousands of State Employee's that once they retired and was vested in the retirement program these insurance companies would be required or leveraged to furnish health care at the same premium as when the employee’s were with the State.  Also, if subsidized by the state now you may be able to look at a very healthy retirement program that possibly could be able to help support at the last resort. 

It would seem with the purchasing power of thousand of state employees this could be legislated into the contracts with the HMO's where they would have to furnish at the same cost as if you were still working.

I believe the party in office would build a lot of voter support in the coming years if a affordable plan could be achieved.

Thanks for your time.

I am writing this email in response to the article that I read in the Miami Herald http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16033075.htm this morning regarding a 56% rate increase for Citizens insurance. I am pleading you to please take action via special session to reverse the law that is requiring citizens to increase rates. I just moved to Florida in April and am regretting this now. I own a small 1200 sq. ft. home in a small village inside Miami called El Portal. My house was built in 1949 and no other insurance company will insure my house for windstorm. I was forced to use Citizens and my windstorm is $4500 a year. With this rate increase my insurance will increase to over $7000. I will be forced to go uninsured if this happens. PLEASE I’m begging you to help STOP the INSANITY of the CITIZENS insurance crisis.

If you and Charlie do not fix this problem now, Florida will experience a 
severe economic down turn.

You as our governor must start representing the citizens and not big

The commission you appointed to make insurance recommendations, had the

Dear Governor Bush,
The people of Florida, the entire state, voted to give Broward and Dade Counties the right to vote, as to whether they wanted slot machines.  
Broward county voted to have them.  This is called the will of the people.
I realize that you are not an advocate of the slot machines, but they are here, whether you approve or not.  The money from these slots goes to the entire state for education.  How can you not  meet with the Native American casinos, to make agreements for the amount they will pay into those education funds.  I do not understand that you would rather have the Bureau of Indian Affairs give them the slots tax free.
You need to get over your petty differences concerning gambling being here, and do what is best for the education system of the State of Florida.

Governor,
I am writing about the debut of class III slots in Florida at Gulfstream and
what it means for the state - which, it seems, eventually might be a
proliferation of Class III slots across the state as the Indians win the
same right to offer the same games at their establishments. Knowing how
ardently you fought against that prospect, I'm wondering if it'd be accurate
to say the introduction of Class III slots into Florida is among your bigger
disappointments as you leave office.

Also, I know the state and the Seminoles ended negotiations on a state
compact but the Bureau of Indian Affairs say they continue to work with both
sides even as they work on regulations allowing the Indians to have Class
III slots. Given that, do you expect regulations to be issued before you
leave office? Or is there still a chance for a compact? Or would you prefer
Charlie Crist have a crack at a compact, and let that happen under his
watch, rather than yours?

Thanks for your time.

This is the letter I sent.

Dear Sir,
                                    I just received my tax bill for 2006,
it shows an amount of  $8,021.01 as taxes owed for my property. I did an
on-line comparison to my surrounding neighbors and found out that my taxes
was approximately 2 to 3 time more than most of my surrounding neighbors .I
will agree that my home is new (and I do have homestead) but why am I
paying 2 to 3 times and in some cases 4 times more that my neighbors , my
home is not 2 to 3 time larger than any of the surrounding homes. I am
enclosing tax records of the surrounding properties for comparison.In
addition several of these homes (shown by *) have a second storage building

I think $ 8,137.00  in property taxes is excessive and will be a tremendous
hardship on me and my family. I have lived in Polk county for the past 20
years, I saved up over the years  and was finally able to get enough money
to start a new home ,now it appears that I will have to give it up.

I can't understand why, my assessed property price is so much higher that
the loan I took from the bank, can someone please explain. I was
homesteaded for 20 years but lost it (the 3 % cap on tax increase) because
I built a new home.

 I spoke with the  Mr .Wayne Clements from the property Appraiser's office
in Bartow Florida ( 863- 413-2549) and he agrees that the taxation is
unfair, but he pointed out that I could sell my property for the amount
appraised but I also pointed out that my  neighbors can do the same so why
am I at such great disadvantage.  This is the United States of America
where equality and justice prevails, the constitution guarantees this.

Please advice , the deadline for my taxes is by March of 2007.

This is the response I received.

Thank you for your writing with your concerns regarding property insurance.
The Governor received your letter and has asked that I respond on his
behalf.

Insurance is the number one issue facing our state today.  Two
unprecedented back-to-back hurricane seasons - with eight hurricanes and
four tropical storms - caused $36 billion in insurance claims.  According
to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, annual insured losses in years
without a major storm average $2.8 billion.

Predictions of more catastrophic hurricanes making landfall in the U.S.
have triggered significant increases in insurance premiums to cover
potential future losses.  Many insurance companies have dropped policies
and restricted new policies to avoid high risk areas and reduce overall
exposure in Florida.  Homeowners who cannot get private insurance have only
two options, no insurance or insurance from Citizens Property Insurance
Corporation, which has the highest rates in the state.

This is a serious situation.  Higher rates and the inability to get private
insurance have created a significant hardship for many homeowners and small
businesses. Moreover, Florida cannot maintain a robust economy and high
quality of life if our state continues to sustain tens of billions of
dollars in damage every year.

The key to solving the problem is fortifying Florida against the potential
damage of future storms.   Reducing the risk of damage will reduce
estimated cost of future disasters, which should stabilize rising insurance
premiums.

You can take steps today to protect your home and reduce your insurance
premium.  Florida requires insurance companies to give a discount on
insurance premiums - as much as 44% on your wind policy - for certain
improvements that guard against wind damage.  Choosing a higher insurance
deductible, either 2% or 5%, can also reduce your premium.

To help homeowners make these improvements, the state is providing $250
million for the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program,
a new program to perform free home inspections and provide matching grants
to qualified homeowners who harden their homes against wind damage.
Qualified homeowners that make approved improvements to their primary
residences may be eligible for reimbursement by the state,
dollar-for-dollar up to $5,000.  Qualified low-income homeowners may be
eligible for up to $5,000 in improvements without providing any matching
funding.  The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program is
managed by the Department of Financial Services.  For information about how
to apply for the grant, please visit www.mysafefloridahome.com.

To provide immediate relief to policyholders, the state provided $715
million to Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to offset the company's
deficit and reduce the surcharge assessed on all policyholders - not just
those with coverage from Citizens.  Without this funding, your insurance
policy would have increased an additional $172.48 for every $1,000 of your
insurance premium.

To increase the availability of private insurance, the state is providing
$250 million for a new Insurance Capital Build-up Incentive Program to
provide matching funds for insurance companies bringing new capital to the
market.  This program will enable private insurance companies to underwrite
more policies.

On August 8, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings held the first meeting of the
Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee.  This committee is open
to all ideas to bring down the cost of premiums, increase availability of
affordable insurance and reduce the risk to homeowners and taxpayers.  If
you would like to make a suggestion, please visit
www.myfloridainsurancereform.com.

Thank you again for your letter.  I am committed to finding a solution to
ease the financial burden that you and many other Florida homeowners are
facing with the rising cost and declining availability of insurance.

Sincerely,



L. Wright
Aide to the Governor

Dear Sir,
                                    I just received my tax bill for 2006,
it shows an amount of  $8,021.01 as taxes owed for my property. I did an
on-line comparison to my surrounding neighbors and found out that my taxes
was approximately 2 to 3 time more than most of my surrounding neighbors .I
will agree that my home is new (and I do have homestead) but why am I
paying 2 to 3 times and in some cases 4 times more that my neighbors , my
home is not 2 to 3 time larger than any of the surrounding homes. I am
enclosing tax records of the surrounding properties for comparison.In
addition several of these homes (shown by *) have a second storage building
on their property.

Hello Governor Bush-
 
I am the University of California Regent-emeritus with whom you graciously discussed your higher education board changes at the Smithsonian's Latino event this past September.
 
Do you have a policy regarding law schools?  I seem to remember that some Florida trustees were attempting to add a law school in South Florida around 2002.  (I will tell you right off that I think additional law schools are bad for business in general.) 
 
If you have a policy regarding the creation or not of law schools, I would appreciate your sharing it with me.
 
Muchas gracias and the best of luck to you and Columba.

Thank you for your writing with your concerns regarding property insurance.
The Governor received your letter and has asked that I respond on his

Insurance is the number one issue facing our state today.  Two
unprecedented back-to-back hurricane seasons - with eight hurricanes and
four tropical storms - caused $36 billion in insurance claims.  According
to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, annual insured losses in years
without a major storm average $2.8 billion.

Subject:	Lack of Funding for Indigent Counsel
Attachments:	Conflict%20Counsel%20Funding[1].pdf

Dear Governor Bush:
 
My employer, Julia Duke, is one of thousands of attorneys in the State who provide legal representation for indigent cilents.  For a second time this year, attorneys are being told that their payment for services will be delayed due to lack of funding.  
 
I have attached a copy of the notice sent out by JAC.  It clearly states that JAC does not anticipate funding for some unspecified amount of time.  It further states that they are working with the Legislature, (which, ironically, isn't even there now), and the Office of Policy and Budget.  I have spoken with Ms. Bruley at JAC and have been further advised that additional information has been requested from JAC before the any further action is taken.  It is my understanding that the Legislature does not reconvene until March of next year.
 
This affects not only the attorneys who provide the services.  Their support staff expects to be paid.  And, the real truth is that there will be many who are going to be told that there is simply no money with which to pay them.  These attorneys are providing services that are mandated by the Constitution of this State.  The utter disregard with which they and their office personnel are being treated is absolutely disgusting.  I'll bet my bottom dollar, not one of the individuals involved in deciding when funding will be available is going to be worrying about a pay check and how they are going to survive until someone decides there's a problem.
 
Governor Bush, I am a good citizen, who works hard, pays her bills and takes her responsibilities seriously.  I'm not convinced that you really feel that there is a serious problem here.  Let me assure you ... most of the attorneys who represent indigent clients are NOT attorneys who enjoy the luxury of a well-padded bank account.  Most will not be able to last the rest of the year without borrowing money.  I'm also not convinced as an out-going governor, that you actually care.  I would apologize, but I can't.  That is just an honest feeling.  If my boss is not able to pay me, I will not be able to pay my obligations.  I will face the loss of my home, my good credit standing and everything I've worked for the last 61 years.  I'm screaming ... this is your problem.  And, it is your responsibility to all of us who are affected by this crisis to do something immediately to stop this insanity. Money is given away by the buckets to those who won't get out and do something constructive.  Those of us who work hard and are responsible citizens at least deserve to be paid what we have earned.
 
I would very much appreciate, and, frankly, expect, some sort of response.  I would also deeply appreciate any assistance you are willing to offer to us to help alleviate this very real and serious financial crisis.

Court appointed attorneys have families and rely on this income just like all of those working in the State of Florida.

Dear Governor Bush,

I have had a problem with Property Tax hikes that I
want an answer to. In July 2005, during Hurricane
Dennis you were on WEAR Channel 3 TV being
interviewed. There was a question about Property and
Hurricane Ivan. You make the statement that ‘If your
property was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan you would not
have to pay any property taxes.’ My house was damaged
by Hurricane Ivan [the roof]. The Army Corps of
Engineers put a ‘blue roof’ on the house and from
September/October 2005 until February of 2006 it
remained. So when I received my property tax bill in
December 2005 [I had to go to the courthouse to get
it], I questioned the 25,000 $ + increase in taxes and
was told ‘Everybody’s taxes went up. Tell me, how does
property become more valuable when damaged then when
it is not damaged? My visit to the courthouse over the
issue left me frustrated—all they could see was
‘Everybody’s taxes went up.’ And two letters sent went
unanswered. Even though the roof was repaired, the
interior damage is still there—I do not have the money
to fix the ceilings and whatever at this time. In
September of 2006 a local Newspaper had some articles
in the Sunday papers for a couple weeks and it got me
to thinking that no matter how I look at it—I was
dealt wrongly. If I had had the money to hire an
attorney I would have done so but it would cost me
more to have the attorney then to just pay the taxes
and do on. 

I have a real problem with damaged house getting a
$25,000 +  tax assessment when I know that the house
is not worth that much. At present, according to the
tax statement, the house is worth $108,000. I really
doubt that it is really worth that, I know I could
never sell it for that—not with the interior damage
that is still present. Besides, Brand New homes that
are a lot more fancier then mine sell for $139,000
starting and my house is almost 20 years old. 

I have not seen the property tax bill for 2006 yet,
knowing these ‘bozos’ they probably went up on my
taxes by 40,000 or so, knowing that the roof was
repaired.


Thank You and God Bless,

Rev. Albert Corey

Dear Jeb,
I am begging you !
 
Please call the session yourself and see this issue through.
I trust you so much as do most of Floridians.
I told you yesterday........at !!,000 a year plus our 7,500 taxes on the house...we are being blown out of the state on these winds.
We do have a newer home...up to code with shutters & reinforced garage doors.
This is awful...our grown children have bought homes nearby and I hate to be forced to leave them....when the grandchildren need me most.
The rate increase was from 3,000 to 11,000  for us   and  outside coverage completely dropped .....that had been $40,000 in coverage for the screen enclosour.........we paid on our policy for 13 + years.
It is outrageous that they can take away yearly what they want.
My feeling is that the original purchased coverage....which for us started in 1992....should have never been altered.
If Life insurance companies did that  ......as we get older & get sick.....the Law  would crack down on them.
Insurance policy  should not be altered after a Contract is purchased!
I pray that happens.
Please finish this mess.

Sir; I do not understand the logic of assessing homes today.
Today, the homes being built have to meet hurricane wind codes and energy codes. By building to these new specifications, we the new home builders are saving money from hurricane destruction and saving energy, YET our property taxes are double and triple what the "save our  homes" houses are.  The older homes are NOT built to today's code, but these people get the tax breaks. This is not fair to the people building homes today.
Another thing, the people displaced by hurricanes that had to build new homes like myself, are now faced with these out of sight property taxes.
The county tax offices are spending money like it was growing on trees (my TREE). There are no cutbacks, no caps on the county's budjets. These county departments are ruining many lives.
I suggest that you give the newly built homes a wind code and energy code tax break for the life of the house. Give the senior citizens a tax free break on property taxes. Is it too much to ask to let senior citizens live out the rest of their lives with no property taxes? This is America, but Florida has gone over the line! I am ashamed to be living in Florida today.

Subject:	Seminole Indian Class III Compact

Importance:	High

Governor Bush,
 
Time is running out for you to step forward and protect Florida from losing millions on Class III gambling at Indian reservations.  The Interior Department will award the compact by November 26, unless the State acts now.  If no agreement is reached by then, I understand the State will never be able to stop or to tax Class III gambling

I was the financial controller who opened the Coconut Creek casino.

The State has been under a Federal mandate for years to reach a "taxing"
compact with the Indians.  This compact would allow Class III gambling
for them, but all profits from all casinos would be taxed.  The tax rate
can vary from 30% to 50% of profits.  With the Seminoles alone at $500
million profit a year, the State would walk away with $150-$250 million
in easy money.  I don't need a gecko to tell me that!

The Seminoles say that the State has not negotiated in good faith, which
is probably true since you have been against all gambling within
Florida.  The Seminoles, on the other hand, have not pushed for the
compact simply because they were a monopoly on gaming and why give up
any profits at all.  Times have now fast forwarded to where Broward
County gets Class III machines, which now gives the Seminoles the same
right to Class III machines at ALL of their locations in the State.
They have petitioned the Interior and the State has received a letter
dated Sept 26th giving the State  60 days (Nov 26) to reach a compact
with the Indians for Class III gambling and the taxing of the Indians,
or risk being able to forever tax the Indians on their gambling profits.

The Seminoles have been waiting for years for this to occur, to sidestep
the State's right to tax.  The new Governor, you and the legislature will
have less than 2 weeks to reach a compact before our right to tax
expires forever.  Talk about stupidity at its best, and we all will be
losers because of personal beliefs in non-gambling by the only State in the
Union who refuses to reap the windfall from Indian gambling and make
life easier for his citizens.

Can't you help?

Attachments:	Conflict%20Counsel%20Funding.pdf

Dear Governor Bush:

 

My name is Julia G. Duke. I am an attorney practicing law in Bay County, Florida. Along with my private family law practice, I represent indigent parents with regard to Dependency proceedings initiated by the State of Florida, Department of Children and Families. I, along with attorneys throughout the state, submit billing for representation of indigent clients at intervals which are specified by the Justice Administration Commission (JAC).

 

I am attaching a copy of the notice sent out from the JAC. As the enclosed attachment indicates, the JAC has exhausted funds for payment of services and does not anticipate any funding through appropriations/contingency funds for an unspecified period of time. The memo from the JAC claims that it is working with your office and the legislature to secure an early release of funds. However, as the 2006 legislative session has ended and the legislative session for 2007 does not begin until March 7, 2007, it seems unrealistic at best for the JAC to make these claims to court appointed counsel. I have a law office to run, must pay my bills associated with the running of my practice and of course, have employees who expect paychecks, as they also have bills to pay. The outstanding billing to the JAC for my fees is based on services already rendered to the State of Florida based on a contract I entered into originally over one year ago and recently renewed in July of 2006.

 

I am required by my oath to the Florida Bar and my contractual obligation with the JAC to continue to provide representation to my existing court appointed clients. I am not allowed to say to the Court that I cannot represent these current clients because I am not getting paid for my services. However, I will not be getting paid for proper and timely bills and services already rendered on behalf of my clients. To say that this situation is outrageous and unfair is an understatement. I will have to try and borrow money from a bank to pay my bills for November, 2006 through March, 2007 unless something is done immediately.

 

I am not sure that you, as Governor, are firmly of the belief that this impending financial crisis for court appointed attorneys is a matter that you believe is truly a crisis. However, I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that you and those in the Office of Policy and Budget will do whatever is necessary to resolve this untenable financial position that I and all other court appointed attorneys have been placed in. I understand that your responsibility will soon be at an end for a matter such as this. Until that time, clearly, this immediate problem falls squarely upon your shoulders. The legislature is not in session and won’t be, save for the organizational session on November 21, 2006, until March 7, 2007.

 

I would appreciate the courtesy of a response from your office as to what measures your office will attempt to  put in place to resolve this very real financial crisis. Thank you for your time and any help you and any other state entity are willing to provide. 

 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am an attorney practicing court-appointed Dependency Law in the Ft. Pierce, St. Lucie County, 19th Circuit.  I understand that the JAC funds have been exhausted for payment of our fees this quarter and that an early release of funds has been requested from your office.  I know that the scheduled release date is not until December 19th.  I am very hopeful that the funds can be released sooner.
 
By this letter, I want to put a face on the name of someone who is involved in this sytem.  I have been representing indigent parents in DCF cases since 1991.  I also previously had a thriving family law/divorce practice.  Two years ago, I gave up the lucrative divorce work and made a comittment to these cases on a full time basis.  Currently I have about 200 Dependency clients.  This is my only income.  
 
We in St. Lucie County have built a very solid and successful Dependency Court program using the team approach.  While we are often referred to as "defense attorneys", we are really just part of the team who work together to reach permanency for our State's children.  Without effective and motivated attorneys, more children will languish and the "system" and suffer the consequences of a bogged down judicial system.  Those of us that have made the comittment really make a difference in the lives of the children. 
 
With this week's news of a "freeze" on payments, many of us will not receive any income.  Some attorneys have talked about giving up the Dependency cases, especially since the news comes so close to the holdiays.    I refuse to give it up.  I sincerely believe in what I do and have the desire to help our children. 
 
I recognize that we should review our current budget and costs to determine if we can make changes which would be more cost effective and I would appreciate the opportunity to be a part of that process.  However, we should not endanger the rights of the children in the interim.
 
Please consider this when determining the timing of the release of funds.
 
Thank you for taking the time to understand.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I own a home in Pensacola, Fl. I have owned it since 1979. In 1987 I accepted employment outside of Florida, but kept the house as rental property with the hopes of eventually returning to Pensacola. To this date, I have not been able to return. I continue to own and rent the property, however, since I do plan to retire in a few short years to that home. 

 

Over the years, the property taxes have continued to rise. Along with the increase in insurance premiums, it will take an average of 4-5 months of rental income to pay for these items. My only choice is to raise the rent. The problem is that in order to raise it to an acceptable level the list of potential renters is greatly reduced. If I lived in the home, I would qualify for the homestead exemption and receive an amount of tax relief, yet I must charge a renter enough to cover the entire tax liability. In other words, those who choose to rent in Florida must pay a higher property tax than those who purchase homes. 

 

I would suggest that Florida either (1) enact a form of tax relief for owners who rent their property in order to keep rents lower or (2)_ place a cap on the amount taxes can be raised for these individuals. Please note that I am not talking about those who rent property for a living, such as apartment owners or property rental companies, just individual owners who desires to rent their dwelling. Without some type of relief, I will be forced to sell my home in Pensacola, thus leaving one more piece of rental property unavailable for those who need it.

 

Sincerely,

 

Robert Heck

Subject:	funding for court appointed attorneys

Dear Governor Bush:
    Yesterday, the lawyers who perform court appointed criminal defense cases received very disturbing news from the Justice Administration Commision.  The bottom line appears to be that insufficient funds have been earmarked by the legislature.  We have been advised that we will have to wait until additional funds are released.  The last communication indicated that these additional funds may not be released until December 19, 2006.
    This situation will cause severe financial hardship for me as well as numerous other lawyers.  Many lawyers who perfom this service are dedicated to their profession and are proud of the fact that they do a service which many lawyers will not undertake.  There is a tremendous responsibility that goes along with representing indigent persons charged with crimes including capital murder.    For many of us the bulk of our practice involves the representation of persons charged with capital murder.  This leaves little or no time to pursue private cases and therefore we rely almost exclusively on the monies earned representing the indigent.  For the most part we are not wealthy lawyers and as many Floridians we live pay check to pay check.
    It is my understanding that this matter is being taken up with the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget as well as the legislature.  I understand that the Justice Administration has been requested to undertake a cost analysis.  In the meantime I would urge you and the legislature to release, immediately, additional funds so that outstanding payments to lawyers and other entities within the criminal justice system be paid.  We have performed our duties in good faith and to the best of our ability with the expectation that we would be timely compensated.
    I have been informed that, at least in the 11th Judicial Circuit, the Justice Administration Commission met with county administrators and were provided information so that the state would have an idea of the costs involved.
    I appreciate your time and concern and hopefully your input can help rectify this situation.

Lt. Governor Jennings and Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I am a citizen of Miami Dade County, Florida where I bought my home two years ago. Last year my taxes were increased due to the drastic increase in the real estate market, where a standard family house in Miami went from $140,000 to $300,000 in a period of three to four years. This year another increase in taxes weaken my my pocket but this was nothing compared to the 300% increase in Home Insurance that my insurance company is presenting to me. I am very concerned with way insurance and taxes are going because I don't see a way out, a breathing space for two professional young people who currently hold two jobs. It just does not seem right that things get to the point were people will have to foreclousure mainly senior citizens that depend on a restricted pension.  I really don't foresee a viable solution for homeowners and this is the reason why I am contacting your office today. 
How are we going to stregthen Florida' families if those families are not going to be able to afford a roof for their childrens.

Re: Possible solution to soaring property tax in Florida

 

The property tax initiative Save our Homes enacted more than a decade ago helped ensure lifelong affordable housing for permanent residents of Florida.  At the time, it was reasonable and appeared farsighted.

 

Now it is time to consider an updated amendment to limit the property tax benefit to the first million dollars of value and expand it to cover up to the same value for all residential and business property owners to add equity to the ever changing and thriving economy in Florida.

 

If all properties are assessed at true market value each year and the property tax paid is assessed at a dramatically reduced millage rate for the first million dollars of value all property owners will benefit equally.  This will protect Florida residents and part-time Floridians as well.  It will also protect the small business and commercial property owner from being taxed out of existence.

 

It will require a complete overhaul of the property tax system initially to establish a program like this but all citizens of Florida will benefit long term and ensure future generations can afford to continue living their dream in Florida.  It could also provide more funding than the current system without hurting the growing population of our state.

Dr.Mr. Governor; 


I write to you today asking you  work  for a plan to address the real-estate property tax situation.   I can you use myself as an example.  As much as I would like to move right now the one item that is keeping me and my family from even looking for a new home are the taxes.  It is simply ludicrous to think that in my situation my taxes would be more than the mortgage.  

Until some practical middle ground is found  I  and other like myself can only sit and wait. 

Thank you

Dear Gov. Bush:
I am totally appalled at the current property tax bill that I received in Broward County. I have lived in a home that I owned with my family since 1989, and then later purchased from my family on my own 2 years ago.

I tried to call the property appraisers office, and I was told 1) I purchased a home above my means and what do I expect my taxes to be on a home with a $229,000 value, and 2) "we don't have anything to do with the property tax amounts, we only collect the money.", and my favorite, 3) "there is nothing you can do, just pay it".

So I have to ask myself, what is a home owner to do. I live in Margate, this is not an affluent area by any means. We are working class people. I was told my homestead exemption would not be effective until this tax year, yet I have been charged 20% higher tax than last year. It was my understanding, that a homeowner with the homestead exemption would only be levied 3% per year.

Now I ask you Governor, what I am supposed to do? The Sun Sentinel is filled with articles of people with the very same complaints. We as Florida residents are being gauged on property taxes as well as Homeowner's insurance.

Does the Florida government want all of the residents of it's state to be forced into bankruptcy on their homes because our government has allowed these things to happen at the cost of it's own citizens?

I know I am reading the newspaper every day, and I am not alone in my complaint of these unfair tax increases. If the property appraiser's office (Lori Parrish) only collects the money and has nothing to do with helping a consumer determine why I am being gauged, I'm asking you who is responsible?

Hi Governor Bush,

I have a burden that many homeowners in Florida share; this burden will soon become a major crisis here in Palm Beach County.

The problem is how property taxes on homes are assessed - with outdated formulas  - ones that were created long before home values doubled and then doubled again. Something must be done: Counties must be forced to stop collecting these unfair property taxes; the burden for homeowners is too great!! 

Please read my attached letter, and let me know if and how you and the state legislature will take immediate action! We really need your attention on this matter! I feel that only the state government can bring about these changes. 

Thanks for everything you continue to do for the citizens of Florida.

Subject:	Fw: FW: Criminal prosecution for avoiding child support

I really don't expect for my case to be changed by this message, but I 
wanted the Governor to know that just passing a law doesn't do anything if 
no one is willing to utilize it.  My original message, which is at the 
bottom of this page, was forwarded to the Dept. of Revenue.   According to 
an operator I spoke with, the DOR does not use criminal prosecution to 
enforce child support.  I was told that they will get an order for contempt, 
then if the payor still doesn't pay a warrant could then be issued and the 
payor COULD be put in jail.

But that's rarely what happens.  I have an Order for Contempt against my ex 
husband for non payment of support.  The magistrate in charge of the case 
decided that, in order for my ex husband to avoid jail time, he could purge 
himselft by making the regular child support payment, PLUS repay the past 
due child support at a rate of $75 bi weekly, for a total of $348+/- 
bi-weekly.  My ex husband made 3 weekly payments of about $175+/-, then 
skipped 2 weeks, made 2 more weekly payments of $175+/-, then skipped 
payments for about 6 weeks.  Since my ex-husband was not following the terms 
of the purge, was not communicating with me as to when he would start paying 
again, I filed a Motion for Committment.  My ex husband was sent a letter 
stating that he had to appear in court to present evidence as to why he 
SHOULD NOT  be put in jail.  Right before we were due to appear in court he 
made a large payment of $1,100.  However, even with this payment, he had 
still paid $800+/- less than he should have since the last time we appeared 
in court, which means that he was still behind by about $3,100.  The 
magistrate did not ask my ex husband why he had not paid the child support. 
He did not point out that 90 days prior, my ex husband said that he could 
afford to make the payments and agreed to the terms that the magistrate laid 
out for him.  Instead, the magistrate basically lectured me.  He told me 
that he wasn't a surgeon and he couldn't make my ex husband pay support if 
he didn't want to.  Then he said that he had never seen how taking away 
someone's ability to earn a living was supposed to get child support paid.

I was prepared for that argument, so I suggested that perhaps my ex-husband 
could be jailed over the weekend - that way he could still work 
Monday-Friday, but he would also understand that there were consequences to 
not paying child support on a regular basis.  The magistrate actually 
snickered at this suggestion.   Then he flat out told me that unless I could 
prove that my ex husband had the ability to pay but just hadn't.  It should 
not be up to me to prove this.  My ex-husband has never once asked for a 
reduction in support payments.  Which should tell the magistrate that he 
does have to ability to pay, otherwise, he'd be disputing the amount.  But 
he never has.

From my point of view, the magistrate gave my ex husband a free pass to not 
pay child support.  So I guess I am going to have to spend the next 8 years 
fighting for each and every penny that is due to me for the care of my 
child.  Which the magistrate apparently knows, because he told me that he 
was sure he'd be seeing me back in his courtroom.

So, unless the magistrates and judges to take this problem seriously, no 
matter how many laws are passed, the custodial parents will still be left 
holding the bag when it comes to supporting their children.  I'm lucky that 
I have a decent job and can usually scrape by until my ex husband feels like 
paying.  But not everyone is as lucky as I am.

I was researching options for dealing with my ex husband who currently owes 
approximately $3,231 in child support.  I came across an article from 2001 
which announced that Gov. Bush signed a bill into law that toughened the 
penalties for those who avoid paying child support.

http://www.myflorida.com/myflorida/government/mediacenter/news/recent_news01/child_support_bill.html

I am not on public assistance, my case is not enforced through the Dept. of 
Revenue, and I cannot afford to hire a lawyer.  I obtained an order for 
contempt in July, and my ex made four weekly payments, but hasn't made a 
payment since September 13, 2006.  Therefore, I would like to request that 
criminal charges be filed.  However, I cannot find any information on how to 
do this.  I called the local office of the State Attorney and was referred 
to the local Attorney General's Office.  The Attorney General's Office 
referred me back to the State Attorney.  When I called the State Attorney's 
Office again, I was told by a rather rude receptionist that they do not 
handle child support cases and that I should call the police.  But I wasn't 
sure even which police to call.  I am trying to have charges brought under a 
state law, so I don't know if I should contact the state police or the 
county sheriff since the child support order is from a county court.  Can 
your office offer any guidance as to how I can have my ex husband charged 
under this law?

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

From:  Fran Griner
 
Let me be sure I understand your response.  Are you stating that it is OK for the State of Florida Dept of Rev. and the Atty General's Office attorneys to violate state and federal laws as long as they are collecting money for children, even those who have never been on welfare and who have never had proper jurisdiction?? 
 
If not,  how do you justify the cover up of these outright violations??
 
I assert you ought to be investigating the child support enforcement contract in Polk County, and other counties, and instead you are making excuses for these agencies....  
 
Is it because the state wants to continue reaping in the incentive monies from the feds??!!
 
I believe you are supporting a great expense to Florida in the break down of relationships with noncustodial parents and contributing to the delinquency of their children, the extreme cost of incarceration of parents for bogus arrearages, and the extreme cost of suspending drivier's licenses, more incarcerations,  and loss of income and being able to vist  parents with their children.
 
I do not agree with your statement that "public records of tracking expenses of individual cases are not available".  The $650,000.00 contract with the Polk County District Attorney as Legal Service Provider for the Dept. of Revenue specifically states that they are to keep records and send in reports to the state regarding their data and expense reimbursements.  
 
These records are supposed to be available for public inspection.   The Dept of Revenue and their Legal Service Providers know exactly how much has been spent on individual cases.  Otherwise they can be charging the state anything they want to litigate and prosecute cases and send in bogus data to the state for reimbursement!!
 
Your agency has allowed the custodial parent to deny visitation for years.  Your attorneys have refused to provide the address of the child. Your attorneys have demanded that I garnish excessive amounts from noncustodial parents wages.  They refuse to adhere to federal laws regarding the self support reserve.  
 
What good do you think you are doing for the best interest of  children?  How are these illegal actions helping the state in the big picture?  It is like going into the Iraw war based on faulty intelligence.    Do you think money is the answer??!!  Don't you think the best interest of children would be that the child support collection agency  stick to the rules and protect the rights of both of their parents!!??  Don't you think there should be oversight in the state's illegal actions?  Why do you support attorneys that disobey the law?  Are you an attorney?
 
Why are you blaming the JUDGE when it is the obligation of the Dept of Rev. to collect a correct obligation based on the administrative Review and Adjustment process when requested by either parent??!!
 
I can only hope Alex Sink will review these child support contracts, and only hope Bill McCullem has some ethical sense about himself to adhere to the Rule of Law and demand that Florida agencies follow the state and federal laws.... 
 
As you are my public servant,  please send a copy of  this letter to Mr. McCullem and Ms. Sink  for me.
 
Thank you,

gfgriner@aol.com 
Dear Ms. Griner: 
Thank you for writing to Governor Jeb Bush to express your concerns regarding the Department of Revenue and the handling of child support cases. The Governor appreciates hearing your views and asked that I respond on his behalf.

I contacted the department regarding your allegation that it refused to produce records, pursuant to a public records request, relating to the amount of money spent on individual cases. According to the department, it does not track spending on a case-by-case basis. Unfortunately, the requested information cannot be provided. For your information, the Child Support Enforcement Program operates on an annual budget of $260.9 million. During the state fiscal year 2005-06, the department collected over $1.2 billion in child support and served approximately 993,000 children.

Regarding your concern that the state is involved in family law matters, government involvement in child support gained momentum in the 1980’s with a growing concern over the non-payment of child support. The federal government passed a series of mandates (42 United States Code, section 666(b)) that attempted to address the widespread problem of non-payment of child support. These mandates represented a plan for all of the states to address the issue of ensuring support for all children.

Florida established the Child Support Enforcement Program with the goal of ensuring that every child in Florida is financially supported by both parents. Section 409.2551, Florida Statutes, provides that the public policy of this state is for parents to be responsible for providing the financial resources needed to support their children and relieving, at least in part, the burden presently borne by the general citizenry through public assistance programs. While most parents do support their children voluntarily, some parents must be encouraged to provide that needed support. The enforcement methods you described, such as reporting to credit bureaus and suspension of driver’s licenses, are tools developed by both federal and state governments to address the needs of children for support and encourage parents to provide that support. 

A matter over which you expressed concern was the due process received by a non-custodial parent in child support cases and your concern that the Florida Attorney General’s Office provides legal services for the Department of Revenue. The department does contract with the Office of the Florida Attorney General and some State Attorney’s offices to provide legal services in certain areas; however, these state officials are there to represent the best interest of the child. In child support matters, the best interest of children is to receive support from both parents. There is no state policy which requires a judge or hearing officer to “cooperate” with the department; judges and hearing officers function as neutral parties within the laws of Florida. If you feel that a particular judge or hearing officer is not acting as a neutral party in a case, I encourage you to raise the matter in the particular case or with the Judicial Qualifications Commission.

Again, thank you for taking the time to write to the Governor. Your thoughts are very important to him. The Governor appreciates hearing from citizens, like you, sharing their concerns and ideas about child support laws and procedures. Please be assured that the Governor will continue to support laws in the best interest of children and that make improvements to our child support system.

I have owned 6 rentals in FL but sold one last year. My feeling is that property taxes should be about the same as 2 months rent. But I have seen drastic increases in my Boca Raton property tax. Perhaps Florida does not like OTHER PEOPLE to buy properties and rent them out to FL Residents. Perhaps people who cannot afford to buy should become homeless? 

There is no increase in services when the property I own appreciates, so why the big increase in Tax?  Certainly these large tax increases will discourage people from owning rental property in your state. Do you want people to own rental property in your state? What would happen if there were NO rental property available in your state? 

Please let me know what is going to happen here. And let me know why the county thinks that just because the resale value of my house goes up, that they can raise my taxes. I cannot raise my rent: my tenant does not benefit from the increase in resale value. And frankly, I do not benefit from the increase in resale value until I sell. Do you want me to sell all of my FL rentals? 

I did sell one of my Boca properties last year and bought 3 properties in MN. Is that what you want? I have a few properties in Orlando and two condos at FSU. Your FL citizens seem to want to rent and have a roof over their head. If I leave, who will provide them with a roof?

Dear Governor Bush,

Now that the elections are behind us, I would urge you to call a special 
session of the Legislature to consider the ad valorem tax issue and the 
property insurance issue which are collectively crippling the Florida 
real estate market. I am concerned that waiting until the regular 
session to address these issues will ensure that there will be no chance 
of a recovery in the market until the "selling season" begins again next 
fall.

I recognize that none of the proposals floating around seem to 
constitute a total solution, and there is a chance a special session 
will not produce a solution; however, there is also a chance that a 
solution will come about, and the public does get some reassurance that 
everyone - you, Charlie Crist, Republicans and Democrats are serious 
about solving these problems.

Governors Bush and Crist:
 
I voted for both of you, and congratulations to Governor Crist on your win.
 
My real estate taxes are off the charts. I own three properties on the water in Florida, and I just moved into one. My taxes went from $6,000 to $14,000 on one property. This is due to the stepped up value on a new home purchase. My insurance costs are also going through the roof.
 
The other homes are rented to tenants. I can barely break even with the taxes and insurance.
 
In short, the current property tax code and escalating insurance premiums are ruining our real estate market. My neighbor pays 1/2 of the tax I pay, and has a house double the size and double the value. This is due to property tax creep which occurs due to the Save Our Homes cap. The cap is great, UNTIL YOU MOVE INTO ANOTHER PROPERTY! And forget it if you rent properties out.
 
I also wonder where all these windfall funds are going? Did our local expenses for public infrastructure just triple? My taxes did!
 
Now is the time to revamp the entire property tax code. It is discriminatory, and inequitable. It is retarding the real estate market, and collapsing and incentive to own premium property.
 
Taxes and insurance are your responsibility. It is time to do something about it. Not just to stabilize taxes, but to bring them down so they are equitable. 
 
I own a property in Colorado, and my taxes there are 20% of my taxes in Florida, for a like valued property. What are you going to do about that?

My suggestion for solving the Home owner's Insurance crisis
 
Limit the amount of liability that private insurance carriers insure any single dwelling to, say, $150,000. This puts a cap on their liability and lowers their premium.
 
Citizens will only write policies from the underlying limits of, say, $150,000 to $500,000. Since only 8% of the claims are over $100,000 (ck it out) this would limit Citizen's liability to only a few claims a year and, again, lower their premiums. They would no longer have to have higher premiums than pvt insurers. 
 
Sounds like a win-win to me. How about you?
 
Please pass on this suggestion to JEB, who I think has done an outstanding job in Florida. I hope he considers running for Prez in '08.

  Dear Governor Bush;

 

The real estate market in the nation and in this state is at a complete standstill. I believe that the underlying reason for the real estate problems in this state are two fold, one being the high cost of insurance and the other is property taxes.  My first reaction on the high cost of insurance would be to have a federally funded wind storm insurance plan similar to the current federal flood insurance program.  Homeowners in wind storm prone areas would be required to have the federally funded program in the same way that those in flood prone areas are required to have.  The problem with that would be trying to get a new program for a localized problem thru the federal government. 

 

I’m proposing the following:

 

As much as I am against suggesting it, we need to increase the state sales tax by ½ point.  Half of that would go to a windstorm fund to be used to repair wind related damages from hurricanes and tornados.  The processing could be done thru existing insurance companies who would only have to sell insurance for fire, theft, and normal liability, but would handle all damage assessments and the disbursements of funds either from the insurance company or from the state fund.  In quiet hurricane years, the funds could be invested and used for educational needs or to temporally reduce the sales tax rate.

 

The governor elect has pledged to raise the homestead exemption by an additional $25,000. As I see it that would not accomplish a thing, because the local taxing authorities will just raise the tax rates to make up the difference. I’m proposing that the other half of the sales tax increase should be used to create a property tax fund. Each year the sixty seven counties would forward their final annual operating budgets and their assessed property value base to the state. The state takes each counties tax base as percent of the sum of all 67 counties’ tax base and applies that percent to the fund and then sends each county their appropriate share. The counties would then adjust their tax rates down resulting in reduced property taxes for the homeowners. There would have to be a state committee to review the budgets to insure that the counties are fairly representing their needs and not overestimating their requirements.  My concern here is that the individual counties will, with this new influx of state money, propose questionable projects.  Anything above normal inflationary increases should be securitized. 

 

As much as I am against new taxes, the benefits here would be two fold.  Homeowners would see reduced property taxes and insurance costs, and some of the cost of these services would be spread to the seasonal residents and tourists who now use our roads, beaches and other facilities.  

 

Best regards and good luck in the future.

Dear Governor, 

Before I go any further, please be assured that the attached plan, although written as a referendum could easily be transformed into legislation.  

Please accept the attached document as a potential solution to the property owner's insurance crisis in Florida. 

The plan is essentially self-insurance incorporating a risk-based trust fund.  I have spent several months on these ideas and there's not any part of it that will not work to ensure adequate and low cost property insurance for all.  I also have a plan for selling the revenue bonds that are not incorporated in this document.

I know it's not possible politically to give me credit for any of the ideas that I might have, or that you might use, from my plan.  Nevertheless I give you my plan freely for your use to lay the groundwork for a solution to our insurances woes.

If I can assist in helping you secure your legacy as governor with this one final grand plan…then so much the better.  I'm glad to help.  The only thing I might ask is that you put in a good word for me with the Governor-elect to help implement this plan, as an employee or some such role.  I would truly like the opportunity to see this through, to see the burden lifted from the shoulders of Floridians, to be a part of the solution.

Thank you very much for your time and good luck in the future.  You have served admirably and earned the respect of many, even when all parties have not agreed.  That is not an easy task to achieve and it is one you have done well.

Kindest Regards,

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I just got my property taxes today and I nearly had a heart attack!  They have literally doubled from last year's amount.  So far this year, my health insurance has gone up 38%, my home owner's insurance has more than doubled, my car insurance has gone up 20%, and now my property taxes...the only thing that has gone up is my pay.  I am now paying over half my salary just to keep my family insured!  I don't know how much more I can take.
 
How much longer do you see Florida having a middle class?  At the rate we are going, I forsee the entire middle class completely wiped out within the next ten years.  If we don't get someone to step in and control these money grubbing insurance companies, you are going to have a state that is 1% upperclass and 99% poverty.
 
You have got to help us!
 
Thank you,

On September 11, 2006, I e-mailed a document requesting that you consider issuing a policy permitting state employees to pray on state property during non-work time (before work, during breaks, during lunch).  It has been almost two months since this document was received by your office, and I have not had a response to my request.
 
I also sent the document to the attorney general's office and, as anticipated, was informed that the attorney general cannot respond to a request from an individual.  His designee also sent me some information about non-government entities using government facilities after hours, which, if expanded to include all non-work functions, would precludenot only prayer but also would prevent folks from having employee birthday parties, retirement parties, or "Monday morning quarterback" session around the coffee pot.
 
Do you intend to address the issue of state employee prayer (during non-work time) before you leave office?

Governor Bush,

I know you are finishing your final term as Governor and I have heard many speeches and read many articles that you are attempting to address the high property tax and home owner’s insurance issues.  I can only express my sincere hope that you will not let these issues fall to the wayside as you step down.  As you can imagine and I am certain you have heard for the greater part of the year these are extremely sensitive issues with all Floridians. As a new homeowner of the State of Florida I too was hit with a property tax bill that increased over a thousand dollars this year and homeowners insurance that increased three hundred dollars.  These types of increases will only make me question my decision to remain in Florida after retiring from the Military in 2008 as I am sure it has already driven many from the State. Please continue to work on fixing these problems while still in office and be sure to pass your insight and potential solutions to your replacement Mr. Crist.

The property tax laws in the state of Florida for us non-residents lucky enough to have purchased a winter home or condo should be illegal.  This law is DISCRIMINATION against non-resident owners, just as sure as if you were discriminating against us because of our skin color or religion.
 
We are only in Florida a few weeks a year & pay hundreds of times more for our property tax than residents.  We purchased our condo in 1980.  Our neighbor, in the Penthouse with the exact same unit as ours, who also purchased in 1980, but lives there year round only pays $2,600.00 property tax.  While we must pay this year $11,193.93 for the exact same condo, 1 floor down, just because it is not our permanent residence.  This year alone we had over a 43% increase in our property tax.  
 
I know that the Florida Voters passed "Save our Homes" in 1995.  This law should be challanged at the Federal Level for discriminating against non Florida residents.  
 
I would think Florida residents would be more than happy to have our sales tax dollars, when we purchase homes, condos, cars, groceries, clothing, etc., when we are there in the winter.  Your Sales Tax is at least fair, because we don't have to pay more because we're not Florida residents, or a different religion or color.
 
Is there anyone we can talk to regarding this matter?  Any direction or help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank You!

We own a second home in Florida for retirement and have seen our real Estate 
taxes escalate two fold within the last three years.    My problem simply 
stated as a part-time resident we are paying more taxes on our second home 
in Sarasota that than my neighbors that are residence of your Fair State pay 
for the same home.  I have no problem with the homestead exemption but why 
do Americans who want to own a second home in Florida need to pay more taxes 
than their fair share.  When we live in Florida for six months, we 
contribute to the state economy but get little of the benefits we are asked 
to front as non residents.  These benefits mainly go to full time residents.

I guess Florida is not interested in helping non-resident senior citizens of 
the United States and treating all resident as equals.  Further, as 
part-time residents we cannot vote in Florida.   Sooo---can we say that we 
are taxed without representation!!!!!!!!!

We retirees have some news for Florida, we can relocate our second homes to 
other sunshine states that threat all citizens alike and do not asked them 
to pay more taxes than the State's full residents pay for the same priced 
home!

Subject:	Best Business Practices

As you are aware, public-private partnerships (P3s) are quickly becoming the new avenue of choice for meeting the needs of Florida’s citizenry.  The premier example of a successful public-private partnership is, of course, Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise.  Exempted from FDOT policies, procedures, and standards (subject to the discretion of the FDOT Secretary of Transportation), Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise is enabled to develop its own rules and implement best business practices in management, finance, organization, and operations. 

Equally fundamental to our quality of life as our transportation system is an aggressive land preservation program.  Following the tremendous success of Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise, it seems worthwhile to consider replicating this public-private partnership model to accomplish the goals of the Florida Forever program.  Although the creation of a “Florida Forever Enterprise” would provide for a myriad of new land conservation and management tools, it is the potential for use of best business practices in financing and funding, including the use of private equity, which would have the greatest impact of the success of the program.

Creating a new public-private enterprise empowered to utilize the best practices of the private sector while operating in the public interest – and operating as a separate business unit of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection – would have the added benefit of providing some financial relief to struggling real estate and banking industries.  With additional funding this legislative session and the ability to maximize its purchasing power through creative private sector financing tools, a “Florida Forever Enterprise” could be a powerful tool in the ongoing acquisition and management of Florida’s real estate conservation portfolio.

Amendment #7 really stinks.
I am a disabled Vet, and do not qualify under this Amendment.
Why?
I joined the service in Oklahoma, but I have spent my entire youth and my established business here in Florida.  I served my time and became disabled not of my doing but because I was in the wrong place at the right time while serving my country.
My property taxes three years ago, use to be $1500.00.  Last year my taxes were $8,000.00 and this year with some pressure our mileage went down an now it is over $6000.00.   Still not easy to come up with the money.  
 
Unfair...amendment 7 should be edited once again and allow all veterans of all wars, peace time or what ever with disability to use this program.  This could have been a fair program, but as I see it, not fair at all. It is a very weak effort by our current administration to show that we Republicans are trying to do something about or residential tax issues. 
 
What's the big deal.  Mandate cutting mileage and it will solve the problem.

Dear Governor Bush,
I don't know if you are able to find a solution to the problem of salaries of paraprofessionals in our State but I am ashamed of our Government because of my salary.  I have worked in the South Florida School District for 14 years and each year my salary has gone down because of my medical benefits for my family.  I believe that because I am an American Citizen that I should take care of my own family and put them through school so that they can contribute to our society.  I have one daughter that is a special education teacher and one that is almost finished with her education in teaching.   I also have two other children that are going into the law enforcement field.  Because my husband works and does not have benefits through his company I cover him and the children through my job.  This year the benefits have gone up and after the increase I will be bringing home about $130.00 every two weeks.  If something happened to my husband I would not be able to survive.  I am an important part of the education of South Florida children and do my job extremely well.  It is a disgrace that this country panelizes a citizen for taking care of their family.  I wish to take care of mine but in a few years will not be able to do so.  If you do not wish for a child to be left behind you should try to take care of the people that are trying to keep them ahead.
Please before you leave office try to help me and others like me so that we can continue to help the children of Florida.
Thank you for your time.

Subject:	Property and Casualty Insurance Reform

Dear Governor Bush: 
 
Over the past two years, property insurance rates have dramatically increased-  this not only affects me, as a homeowner, but also as an owner of a timeshare property. Florida Law requires that my timeshare owners association insure my timeshare property for full replacement value, leaving little room for negotiation with the insurance companies or reductions in coverage. 

As a timeshare owner, my concerns with these unprecedented insurance increases include: 
 
1. How does the State of Florida plan on increasing the number of insurance 
carriers, thereby giving timeshare associations more choices with carriers? What can be done to decrease costs or place reasonable limits on increases in premiums? 
 
2. Hurricanes have been a known weather condition in the state for years. Why 
have the issues of increasing premiums and decreasing number of insurance carriers not been addressed before? 
 
3. What can be done to help timeshare and condominium associations take steps to improve their properties and provide better protections from severe storms? How can such improvements be taken into account in determining appropriate premiums and deductibles? 
 
4. The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program provides free inspections and grants to individual homeowners, but what is being done to help timeshares, condominiums and businesses? 
As a timeshare owner, I appreciate your commitment to protecting the future of 
Florida's tourism and hospitality industries - and individual owners like myself

Subject:	Request of the Office of the Honorable J. Bush  Governor of Florida -  Property Tax Moratorium and Audit Volusia County

To the Office of the Honorable J. Bush: 

 

I apologize for writing your office directly as I know you are very busy.  I am a concerned about my property which I have owned for 33 years in New Smyrna, Florida.  

 

This communiqué is a request for your office to initiate/support an activity to look into/audit what appears to be an unbalanced situation in regards to Volusia County City of New Smyrna area:

*	Property tax formulas 
*	Property assessment processes 
*	Property tax allocation process of dollars for the City of New Smyrna area.  

 

Folks are struggling to continue to afford their property and homes.  Due to double digit escalation of property taxes, many folks are beginning to sell their homes. 

 

Personal profile, future hopes and concerns:

*	My wife and I are in our early 60’s.  We achieved what we thought is a middle class economic level. 
*	We are former residents of Florida and had plans to return for our retirement years to a condominium apartment we purchased in 1973.  
*	Over the last 33 years we achieved paying off the New Smyrna mortgage for a condo apt...  
*	Our plans were to retire to the condo apt with a reasonable cost owner ship related to property taxes, utilities, etc and shared common property maintenance costs.  We thought property expenses to be financially manageable for our modest future fixed income.  
*	Our condo apartment taxes for 2006 are proposed to be $ 7,821.00.  An increase of 58% from last year.  Less than 5 years ago taxes were $2,394.  
*	When we retire, we are financially planning that we could live for another 20 years.
*	For those future 20 years the majority of our yearly retirement income will come from social security and the rest supplemented by modest monthly diminishing amounts from savings and a small 5 yr monthly pension left over from a “Hostile” take over and liquidation sale of the Singer Company.  
*	Now it appears that taxes will initially be almost half of my gross estimated social security in 2008.  

 

My concern is that the Volusia County double digit property tax escalation process in the New Smyrna area is just out of line with the ability of the residential property owners afford to live in their property and the basic public service needs.  I’m requesting that the present tax assessment methodology be audited and revisited.  One would think that our civil servant tax and legislative administrators would have gained lessons and learned wisdom over the last 30 yrs from the experiences of their colleagues who shifted tax burdens to private property owners and turned many communities in to ghost towns.  

 

I’ll also try to be part of the solution since I have expressed my concerns which could be considered negative to the reader. 

 

The following thoughts/steps are for an approach to get our arms around a situation which seems very unbalanced and riddled with inequalities.  

 

1.	For 2007 freeze all property taxation schedules to 2006 levels by virtue of initiating an audit.  
2.	Freeze all new ground breakings/projects requiring Gov’t Financial Support unless other sources of $ can be found (such as selling municipal bonds to the public etc.)
3.	For 2007, continue with the enhancement of “only” critical activities that can be supported with-in the 2006 funding levels with out creating deficits.  Focus on Police, Fire/Rescue, Education, Community Medical and Maintenance of existing public properties.  
4.	Initiate an audit of property assessments procedures, processes, revenue allocation structure touch points, and the beneficial use New Smyrna receives from Property tax revenues collected.
5.	Initiate a concurrent study conducted by disinterested 3rd party chartered to generate a Feasibility Study Report that explains the “AS IS” conditions and recommends a “TO BE” new tax lowering assessment methodology.

 

Thank you for your time.  I hope you will take my communiqué seriously.  Quite frankly, loosing my ability to afford the taxes on our retirement condo apartment and watching it to begin slip away from us is very frightening.  I look forward to hearing that this matter will be looked into and a new balanced approach of leveling property tax can be developed.

 

Very truly yours,

Subject:	Another tax break for disabled vets.?

  You have to know that existing property tax laws setting up different criteria of eligibility for Florida disabled such as vet disabled, and non-vet disabled is in violation of title 2 of the ADA.!! 
  The ammendment asking for more tax breaks for vet only disabled is also just as illegal under title 2 of the ADA., regardless of whether it passes or not!!!
  Title 2 states that states cannot set up eligibility requirements that screen out the disabled, which is what the state is doing by offering these tax breaks to vet. disabled only!!!
  Are you in support of government backed discrimination against the non-vet, disabled of this state? If not, do something quickly!!!

Dear Lieutenant Governor Jennings:

I know you have been briefed about the flood insurance availability crisis that is affecting thousands of homeowners within our state who reside within the Coastal Barrier System. Attached please find a copy of my most recent Letter to the Editor that restates an outline of how a state-administered, self-funded flood insurance pool might be established as a last resort of guaranteed flood insurance availability. I have requested that this critical issue and our proposed remedy be included in the upcoming special session of the legislature on numerous occasions. While your office has expressed confidence that this issue will, in fact, be addressed, I have attempted to get an official confirmation that the agenda will provide a forum for that to happen. I respectfully request that the extensive documentation I've already provided on the subject, as well as the attached outline of the proposal be made part of the official record. Thank you.

Subject:	Property and Casualty Insurance Reform

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Over the past two years, property insurance rates have dramatically increased - this not only affects me, as a homeowner, but also as an owner of a timeshare property.  Florida Law requires that my timeshare owners association insure my timeshare property for full replacement value, leaving little room for negotiation with the insurance companies or reduction in coverage.
 
As a timeshare owner, my concerns with these unprecedented insurance increases include:
 
1.  How does the State of Florida plan on increasing the number of insurance carriers, thereby giving timeshare associations more choices with carriers?  What can be done to decrease costs or place reasonable limits on increases in premiums?
 
2.  Hurricanes have been a known weather condition in the state for years.  Why have the issues of increasing premiums and decreasing number of insurance carriers not been addressed before?
 
3.  What can be done to help timeshare and condominium associations take steps to improve their properties and provide better protections from sever storms?  How can such improvements be taken into account in determining appropriate premiums and deductibles?  
 
4.  The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program provides free inspections and grants to individual homeowners, but what is being done to help timeshares, condominiums and businesses?
 
 
As a timeshare owner, I appreciate your commitment to protecting the future of Florida's tourism and hospitality industries - and individual owners like myself.
 
Sincerely,
 
Paul and Lisa St.Clair

Hey Guys, 

 

Guess What? My family is about to be forced into selling two homes, one in North Lauderdale (owned the home since mariti boat lift) and the second in Fort Lauderdale (owned the home since 1977). Both homes were purchased for family members who have moved on to their own homes. Both homes never homesteaded for what ever reason (I was 2 yrs old could not read the paper work). Now it is 2006 both properties are rentals (for the working class), and still can not be homesteaded. Total taxes for these two homes are $7000.00 plus property insurance. It makes more sense to two sell these homes and move on. But how can we with the current real estate market? Think about it, we will have to raise rent about $300 per home to cover the increase this year. Know this will affect two more families, no more affordable housing.

 

Everything that my family has worked for is about to be lost. History and memories. These homes played a big part in my families’ life. Several generations grew up in these homes. 

 

 

Jeb, call a special session, do something before you leave. 

Jim and Charlie spell out your plans and make sure that they work.

Lori, it may feel like you’re caught in the middle, but it may be time to step up.

As I see things, each one of you all has a vested interest in this situation. No one works for free. You all make money by working for the community. Now go to work.  

 

Please do not email me back with the usual brush off. It will not be accepted. Let me know what you have planned for tomorrow.

Subject:	Property Tax Assessments

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Just a thought in reference to the property tax situation.  Why not consider rolling back property tax assessments to something less than 100% of the taxable value.  I recently visited the State of Tennessee and was advised that the state only taxes property on 25% of the assessed value.  While I am sure that 25% would be unreasonable here, I am sure a reasonable could be ascertained for the state.  I don't know if this would just take a change of Florida law or a constitutional, but it could be considered as an equitable way to assist all property owners.  If and when times get better, i.e.. lower property values it could be changed again.
 
 
 
                                                                                                    sincerely,

Governor Bush,

I find it difficult to understand why my gross tax obligation to Collier County this year will be $24,802.15, up 50.5% over last year.  The difficulty is more comprehension than understanding.  I understand there is an opportunity for residents of Florida to take advantage of Save Our Homes and Homestead tax exempt values.  I understand that the Market Value of properties were adjusted to reflect today’s valuation.  I just find it tough knowing that my neighbor, whose home value is similar to mine, is only going to pay $5,206.22.  I believe there will be a real estate problem for Florida when property taxes exceed the threshold of pain for non homestead owners like myself.  I hope to retire someday to my home in Naples, Fl.  Until then, I would encourage tax reform to more equitably share the burden with those who use Collier County services everyday.

Dear Governor Bush:
Today I received a tax bill for vacant land I own in Hendry County.  This land is not in a vibrant metropolis with a large population or high crime rate.   The community where the lot is located has mostly mobile homes.  The biggest thing in town is the Wal-Mart.  However, due to speculation investors have purchased many lots and now my $3,500 lot is assessed at $30,630, last year it was assessed at $10,000.  What I find peculiar is that the needs of the County of Hendry required a 300% tax increase.  I believe this requires your immediate attention and a full audit of the finances and spending practices of Hendry County.  
 
We cannot wait for a slow paced study of this problem.  We have been thrust into an emergency situation and it requires a prompt and thorough investigation.

I have just recreived my tax bill and am outraged.  I own a small condo in Ft. Pierce that is not gated. We come from a small northern n.y. town and are retired working class people in our 70's. We have limited income with no big pension.
 
My tax bill is $2562.34 for property assessed at $106, 000., an increse in assessment of almost $40,000. from 1994.  my neighbor's tax bill is in the $800. range. Because I am only a 5 month resident, I am being penalized and basically I am subsidizing schools roads and all services for permanent residents. How can you possibly justify this outrageous disparity? 
 
The economy of Florida owes a lot of it's revenue
to people like us.  We enjoy our stay, are pleasant, tip well, support our church and volunteer while we are here. The legislation "Save Our Homes" is well intentioned, but has created an immoral taxation disparity. This is my home too. Perhaps what is needed is a huge class action suit to bring attention to this wide skew in taxes. What an unjust situation.  I expect to pay somewhat higher taxes than residents, but this is truly unjust taxation.
 
Please don't tell me you are working on this.  We all know how this works out. I am informing everyone I can by all available methods about this unjust taxation. We are retired and are paying almost as much for our condo as our little house in northern N.Y.  Bottom line...I will lose my condo which I am trying to save for my children as  I cannot afford the taxes. Perhaps this why many northerners are looking to the Carolinas and other states.

Subject:	Re: RE: Property Ins Reform Committee

Dear Governor Bush,

   Thank you for your reply to my letter.  Unfortunately I believe we 
see things very differently.  While you are trying to keep all sides 
happy and maintain what I feel is the status quo, my fellow Floridians 
and I on the other hand want results.

    A first starting point that our government can do and has direct 
control over is the accounting practices for re-insurance by 
subsidiaries thru their parent companies and using the costs as 
expenses.  Stop this practice by not allowing these major insurers to 
form spin off companies for just the state of Florida.  This practice 
allows nationwide insurers (who are making record profits) to show on 
paper a loss.  Force these companies to account for re-insurance costs 
using GAAP.  If a cost is paid from one entity of a corporation to 
another in equal amounts, it is NOT to be treated as an expense by the 
corporation.  This alone would make it much more difficult for these 
companies to justify rate increases which are just hidden massive 
profits by the parent company.

    The next item that YOU and the legislature must address 
immediately is the use by nationwide corporations of the ability to 
form subsidiaries that only operate in small geographic areas and use 
that ability to confine loss mitigation and claims within those 
areas.  State Farm and Allstate are prime examples, but just about all 
the companies do it.  They form State Farm Floridian for the state of 
Florida then claim after a storm they need to raise rates, restrict 
new policies, and “cherry pick” new areas to serve.  All the while 
they pay millions in re-insurance to State Farm Corporate, claim an 
expense, and corporate shows record profits.  They should be required 
to issue policy, balance risk, and account for funds on a nationwide 
basis, not just Florida.  Why is that the only states that have these 
subsidiaries are the high risk states?  I’ll gladly tell you, their 
actuaries show them it is the best way to maximize profits and 
minimize risk to shareholders and executive
 salaries and perks.  As Governor and Legislators YOU have the power 
to stop this practice.  Stop being swayed by campaign contributions 
and lobbyist influence and do what is right for our state.

   You mention the Hurricane Mitigation Program.  Good idea, but under 
funded to do what it was intended to do.  In addition you and the 
government have seen fit to earmark ALL of the funds to coastal 
areas.  This keeps my neighbors and I out of the program, even after I 
submitted all necessary paperwork.  A nice government perk for coastal 
property owners, you subsidize them upgrading their mansions at 
taxpayers cost.  Good idea Mr. Governor!  This in my opinion just 
exasperates the whole problem of reducing the insurance load.  One of 
the main reasons we are having an insurance "crisis" is that coastal 
development is inherently much more risky than inshore development, 
and couple that with the fact that most if not all of the homes in 
those areas are of much higher value than the median Florida home 
price.  The bottom line for me and many of my neighbors is STOP 
government subsidy of coastal development and high priced homes.  If 
people insist on moving and building there,
 let THEM assume the risk of doing it, not the rest of us. Place a cap 
on coastal homeowners insurance at $500,000 for property and let the 
individual owners assume the additional risk.  If one can afford to 
live there, one should be responsible for paying the cost, not the 
rest of Florida.  Another GOOD option is after a storm destroys a 
property have the state buy out the owner and take the land and make 
it un-developable.

   As for insurance discounts for windstorm mitigation, as someone on 
a fixed income, with children and limited in regards to money 
available to improve a home we thought was strong, having to come up 
with a lot of cash or go into debt to secure a modest insurance 
discount is just not possible.  Instead of matching grants for people 
living in coastal areas in homes valued at $1 million plus, the money 
should be earmarked for fixed or low income homeowners who truly need 
the help whatever area they live in.   The whole state of Florida is a 
high risk area, but the coastal areas are off the risk charts. It must 
be nice for someone living in a $1,000,000 home to get a $5000 
matching grant from Florida to reduce his already subsidized Citizens 
insurance premium while the majority of us who cannot afford to 
mitigate see nothing but increases in our insurance premiums.  You 
MUST start limiting the giveaways.  Stop the grants to people with 
income over $60,000 a year or homes value
d more than the mean (maybe $500,000 replacement value).

    As for the Citizens bailout, again if you as Governor didn't allow 
Citizens to become overloaded with expensive coastal properties that 
no one else will touch Citizens would not be in its current 
situation.  Watching some of the OIR hearings and testimony by 
Citizens executives and actuaries, it is plainly clear that unless the 
government, meaning YOU changes Citizens economic model things will 
NOT get better.  There is just TOO much high priced coastal exposure 
within Citizens overall risk for it to ever not need large government 
grants.  Again, the solution for this problem also is to restrict 
government subsidies for wealthy coastal property owners and 
developers but limiting Citizens to a maximum policy limit for ALL 
homes.  It seems to a lot of us that normal Floridians are suffering 
because local and state politicians want to allow developers and 
builders (who are large campaign contributors) to develop risky areas 
so as to gain tax revenue and campaign contributio
ns.  This has to stop for Florida to ever have a chance to continue 
growing.  The constant pressure on inland homeowners to subsidize 
coastal property owners will eventually force most middle income 
people out of their homes.  And without the middle income people 
Florida will lose industry, business, and the driving economic force 
behind the economy.

    As for your "Reform Committee" it is frankly a joke!  You have 
seen fit to staff the committee with politicians, insurance agent 
politicians, and political insiders who all have their own agenda, 
which is NOT reform to help homeowners and small business owners.  
Maybe if you politicians listened to average people you would take 
heed of the real answers, peoples need, and be strong enough to do the 
right thing and stop helping the wealthy, influential, and connected 
individuals that have contributed to this entire mess.

     Why can't you, as our Governor use our Congressional delegation 
and your personal access to the President to get the federal 
government to institute a national hurricane disaster insurance 
program that would spread the risk out over the entire country.  They 
do it with the national flood insurance program, put some pressure on 
them to do the same for hurricanes!  When my grandparents could pay 
$655 a year on $500,000 of replacement value on a beachfront home in 
NJ, we here in Florida should be able to pay no more than $1000 a year 
for the same coverage here.  Even if it is capped at $275,000 
replacement value it would be a BIG break for homeowners here to only 
have to cover the excess value through primary carriers.  And it would 
give the primary carriers a break in the event of a major hit from a 
Cat 4 or 5 storm.

   As an independent voter I personally am fed up with the Republican 
Party and its leading politicians.  I am a great proponent of small 
non-invasive government and have supported the Republican agenda for 
years, but this mess leads me to wonder.  The party that used to be 
small government, low taxes, and open markets has become the party

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a Captain in the U.S. Air Force stationed in Panama City, FL.  I am currently taking night classes to get my Master's degree at Florida State.  I have been assigned to debate the topic of educational reform.  I will be specifically defending No Child Left Behind, FCAT, charter schools, and vouchers.
 
I know the you constantly address these educational issues when speaking in public.  If I could get a talking paper or outline with some hard hitting facts I would greatly appreciate it.
 
Thank you,

Subject:	MDCPS - PLEASE help!

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I implore you to get involved in the Miami-Dade County Public School teachers’ contract renegotiations.  The salary proposals being considered (union and county) are both woefully inferior.  The skyrocketing cost of living in Miami is not even being considered by either side, and teachers in nearby counties with lower costs of living are earning much more now and will continue to do so if either of these proposals is accepted.

 

At one point, I was a 7th-grade language arts teacher in the district, but I realized that the tremendous effort required was not worth the meager salary, especially since I was so poorly paid that those long sought-after summers off were impossible, since I used to make half my annual teachers salary consulting as a tech writer and technical trainer during the summers.  When I quit teaching, I was making low-30s because I’d only joined the system two years earlier after having spent several years in the business world.  Do you know how many teachers asked me, “But how many years do you have in the system???” when they found out that I was considering leaving?  I was amazed that, for these poor folks, teaching is no longer a career that they derive pleasure from.  It’s more like a means to an end, just time served till retirement, and the fact that they don’t make enough to even survive here anymore adds insult to injury.  Most teachers have to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet, and that sad fact has resulted in a decline in the quality of education in MDCPS because no one working that many hours can put in the time and effort required to be a good teacher.  The worst of it all, if I may be so bold as to say so, is the fact that the district superintendent, Rudy Crew, is showered with bonuses and raises and accolades for the improvements in the county while the teachers haven’t had a new contract ratified for the last three years.  He isn’t worried about paying his rent or getting his old clunker fixed or having his water turned off.  He lives in luxury, yet the majority of his employees – not just teachers, but office personnel, paraprofessionals, security monitors, and cafeteria workers – live in the poorest neighborhoods, many without the most basic dependent health coverage because the county only provides free insurance to its employees.

 

To be blunt, there seems to be a fundamental flaw in the way education is organized in the state of Florida.  Having grown up in Massachusetts, I can say that I have always wondered why each union (in this case UTD) meshes so perfectly with its district (in this case MDCPS).  Why are UTD and the MDCPS so close?  Who is on whose side anyway?  In MA, there is a STATE-WIDE teachers union, and the districts are by TOWN, not by county.  That is the definition of collective bargaining, isn’t it?  There are so many problems with the district because of its sheer size and incredible growth year after year.  If the district were broken up into smaller units, there would be great improvement.  For example, as things currently stand, administrators are always looking for the next school to open in order to take their next career leap.  If an AP knows that several new schools will open in the district in the next year, how much incentive does he really have to stay where he is and dedicate his life to improving his school?  All he wants is to climb until he gets to the top.  In MA, assistant principals remain contentedly in their positions for years and years because there is nowhere else to go, unless they want to move on to a new district.  In fact, there are principals who have spent their entire lives at the same school, and in general MA schools obtain excellent test scores and do not have unhappy, underpaid teachers, as we do in MDCPS.

 

I know that I have thrown a lot of information at you, but there are better ways of doing things.  Sometimes, people just keep doing things the same way simply because that is the way they have always been done.  However, I’ve heard that the definition of insanity is “doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.”  I just hope you can help stop the insanity.

Jeb Bush,
Please take the time to read my story.
I purchased my home three years ago, have lived
humbly, and am now ready to purchase again.  I am able
to afford my new potential monthly mortgage note, but
property taxes are preventing me from making the
purchase.  I am a teacher and my wife is a social
worker (she gives therapy to children from abusive
parents).  We both work hard, sit in traffic, and pay
our taxes.  Our career choices-helping young people
get an education and cope with their abusive
parents-have already limited our possibilities as far
as what type of home we will own as our salaries make
it very difficult to afford a single-family home in
South Florida. Now with property taxes, our options
are further limited.  Property taxes are based on the
assessed value of your home.  What is the value of my
home based on?  In South Florida, it is difficult to
deny that a great deal of the home's value is based on
speculation, sometimes by real estate investors, other
times, home prices are driven up by agents.  This
variable in the home's price is sometimes
"fantasy"-the speculators imagine high prices, and we
have high prices; or buyers and sellers get in a
frenzied state, and prices soar.  In South Florida,
immigrants from Latin America (sometimes illegal) also
drive up prices.  As you know, the prices of homes are
determined by a number of things-interest rates, what
the stock market is doing, the state of the economy,
the job market, etc.  
The point is, I have no control of housing prices.  
(My own property taxes have doubled since I purchased
my home-does the garbage man pick up the trash
faster?Are there double the amount police on the
streets? Are there twice as many schools in my area? 
Are the services I pay for that much improved?)
The people that effect it include real estate agents
looking for a quick profit, the fed chief,
speculators, and immigrants.
You have been in office during the housing boom, did
anyone in your office figure homeowners, particularly
teachers and social workers, would have difficulty
affording their property taxes?
Sincerly,
homeowner and tax payer,
Cato

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Below is an e-mail I sent to my local property appraiser’s office.  What is being done about the ridiculous costs of property taxes in this state?  How has the extra “income” been spent?  I do not see a lot of improvements anywhere?  School teachers are still underpaid; local roads still need a lot of work?  Where is all that money?  Is local government wasting it?  Also, the assessments do not make any sense!  Orange County has my home lot at a value of $65k I promise you I would NEVER be able to sell that lot for $65k so where did that price come from?  We need help Governor Bush, we need these taxes lower or I am afraid a lot of people with not are able to pay their taxes and continue to live in this state.  It is way too expensive!

 

 

This is the e-mail I sent to the appraiser’s office:

 

I wanted to voice my concern about the high cost of property taxes.  Wow!! I am really nervous about my new bill in January and really confused as to how your office came up with the $65k value for my very small lot!  What is being done about these rising costs?  I do have an expensive home, I’ll admit it, but the only reason I was able to afford it was because I purchased a home when sales prices were low and was able to sell high.  I will not be able to afford $7,000 or more in taxes that is almost $700 per month!! That in itself is a mortgage payment!  What is being done by your office to help hard working people like myself with this high bill?  How did your employee come to a value of $65,000 for the lot my home is one!!  That is silly!  I could never sell that lot for $65k why are my taxes based on that amount!  This does not make any sense to me.

 

Not one lot in my neighborhood has sold for 65k, so how did your office come up with this value?

Please do something to help the snowbirds....we contribute a lot to the economy of Florida, have no children in the schools, yet are being forced to sell our winter residences because of the escalation of real estate taxes. We are seniors who live on a fixed income, own a condo, live there 5 months of the year, and our taxes went up $2000 in the last 2 years.  There will be forclosures of property, and a mass exodus from Florida. I wrote last year, and nothing is being done. We are being crucified! Is there any relief in sight, or do we too have to leave our home there? The homesteaders have protection, while our taxes go up over 20% a year.  Property values are dropping, and properties are getting difficult to sell.  The handwriting is on the wall, and is being ignored!   SAD! Please help!  Arlene Martindale.

I know you won't read this or care but the retired people of Florida are being insured and taxed out of our homes.
 
My taxes this year are $3000, Insurance 1,800.  My husbands Social security 1300, pension 209 and my pension is 380.  Our house payment 1s 1400 now and will now go up another 100 a month.  We have spent our 401 k's, depleted our savings and will now have to sell our home and move out of the state.  4 other friends are doing the same thing.  At this rate Florida will go to the people who can afford it which will be the drug dealers.  it is sinful what you have allowed to happen in this state.  Our area thankfully was not harmed by the hurricanes, yet we have to pay a surcharge to another company plus the increase by our agent.
 
As I write this I am crying because I thought I was living my dream and it just got shattered.
 
Thanks for not protecting the majority of your people the senior citizens.

>It has been hard for us to live in the State of Florida, so we have made adjustments and taken the hard lumps and adjusted our lives to live here. But now with seeing our new homeowners insurance bill going from 1,400- to 4,500.  I don't think we can take it here any more.  Maybe if this was the only thing we have had to endure since moving here we could take it, but it's not.  The other great expenses have hurt us over the years, and we feel very beaten down.  The schools in Florida are terrible, so we adjusted and Homeschooled through Calvert School of Maryland at our own expense.  The No Child Left Behind Act is a terrible joke.  Unfortunately the joke is on the kids who are being left behind.  Focus should be placed more on an intense educational program-such as the Calvert program.  We speak from experience, as we removed our daughter from your education system in third grade.  As the FCAT was the main focus the school system was placing all of our childrens time.  Instead of it being used as a tool they are only teaching tricks on how to pass it.  When will everyone wake up and just give the teachers a great curriculum to work with, hire better teachers,and use the tests as a tool to measure. The difference in our daughters advancement once we removed her from Florida schools and placed her in Calvert was incredible. The pay scale in Florida is very low, and with all of the illegals here it keeps it very low.  How can we compete with people who live with 20 other people under one roof, and we just have a family of four under one roof.  So we started our own company a few years ago but I'm not sure it's worth it.  Since starting our company 3 years ago gas prices tripled, taking our gas bill for one truck from $200.00 to $600.00 monthly.  Your roads are so backed up and congested it takes one and a half hours to travel 12 miles. The republican trickle down theory does not work any more,  this older generation is different.  We see this incredible phenomenon when out all the time.  We will give you an example, when eating out and overhearing the retired ladies in their 60's sitting next to us discussing their golf outing where they have to pay a membership of $100,000.00 just to join and then they left a $1.00 tip.  This is how well the trickle down theory works.  It may have worked a long time ago, but those days are gone.  We see this type of attitude all the time.
>Up until now we have voted republican,  even though we are greatly harassed and thought insane from our Democratic family in Massachusetts.  We feel so squeezed as middle class hard working Americans. We don't think we will be voting Republican any time soon.  We think our family in MA has finally convinced us that we have been crazy to vote Republican because we feel like we're the last on your list of priorities.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I know you must receive thousands of letters, emails and phone calls a day. I am not sure that one email from a hard working Realtor in Palm Beach County would make a difference but I am going to try...
 
Governor Bush, our people of Palm Beach County are suffering because we cannot sell our homes. Insurance rates are high and so are our taxes. Locally we have thousands of people that would like to move up to a new home or retire as people have done for decades. They are finding it impossible to afford even the smallest upgrade or to sell their large homes that are now void of children. Young couples, singles, and the elderly are the hardest hit with the current housing market. I have even found that the our market driven by the Northeast has now found interest in Phoenix, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. We are loosing many of our own Floridians to these states. 
 
Mr. Bush I plead with you to take our voices to Washington and the Federal Reserve to get our economy moving again here in Palm Beach County and the state of Florida. I am a transplant from Boston, MA I could think of a better place to live and bring up my children!

Dear Honorable Governor Bush, 

I am a graduate pharmacist (non-practicing), in healthcare for over fifty (50) years, as an executive with a major pharmaceutical company for twenty-three (23) years, two (2) years running a small pharmaceutical company, a business owner for twenty-six (26) years, and life long Republican. 

As a healthcare professional I understand the need for control over the manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceuticals.  However, when you signed into law, Florida Statute 499, PDMA Prescription Drug Marketing Act, you positioned the secondary distributor of pharmaceuticals in a noncompetitive, compromised market position.   

You and your staff understand the requirements under which a licensed, small business drug distributor must now operate under this law.  This same law unfairly precludes the larger, direct buy distributor, from the costly administrative and operational impact of pedigree tracking , which has been placed on the smaller, secondary pharmaceutical distributor.   

The rippling effect of this law has now created a monopolistic situation for these same larger, direct from the manufacturer purchasing distributors.  McKesson, has stopped shipping to secondary distributors in the State of Florida, while General Medical, a subsidiary of McKesson, has sales people calling on the same accounts as our sales people.  With pricing and operational advantages, how are we to compete????  The attendant fallout from this legislation will be the reduction in the number of smaller, local, privately held, licensed, creditable pharmaceutical distributors, who can't afford the additional operational costs and competing in a monopolistic environment with the larger, primary pharmaceutical distributor companies. 

As an example of this monopolistic positioning, under the guise of covering the additional (?) administrative and software costs,  Amerisource/Bergen Brunswick, as of December 1, 2006, will implement a charge of $5,000 per month per distributor, $60,000 per year, if we're to continue to purchase drugs from them.  With McKesson, withdrawing from shipping into Florida, Bergen is our sole source.  Estimating at least 20 small distributors in the State of Florida, represents $1.2M IN JUST ONE STATE!  (This is extortion made legal under the guise of covering the additional costs to administer the requirements brought about through the passage of Statute 499.) 

I endeavored, before this legislation was signed, to present a logical and rational perspective in my letter to you, as well as legislators at both the State and Federal level.  I have also communicated and encouraged our national healthcare associations to do the same, which they did.  Unfortunately, the lobbying of the  Healthcare Medical Distributors Association (HMDA), which is comprised of the "Big Three" primary drug wholesalers, with their war chest,, prevailed.  Now we're experiencing the fallout effect, which has already started. 

The sincere intent of this message is to present additional perspective as to the ramifications of what has and is taking place at the national level, as a fallout from this type legislation.  Therein, I would hope that the staff member who reviews this message allows it to come through to you directly.

DRUG WHOLESALERS SEEKING INJUNCTION TO STOP DRUG TRACKING PROGRAM
A coalition of drug wholesalers will soon seek an injunction in federal court to delay the implementation of the FDA's long-awaited drug tracking program, contending the new requirement will devastate their businesses. 

The National Coalition of Pharmaceutical Distributors and companies like RxUSA Wholesale are challenging the FDA's plan to require certain manufacturers to have pedigrees for their products beginning Dec. 1. A pedigree is a record of all transactions a drug goes through, from the manufacturing plant to the dispensing pharmacy. 

Smaller wholesalers say the program will ruin their businesses by establishing a requirement they are unable to meet. The problem is that these wholesalers purchase their products from larger authorized distributors that are not required to keep these records or provide them to the unauthorized companies. 

The agency based its rule on the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA). The act, which amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, exempts a drug's manufacturer and the "authorized distributor of record" from the pedigree requirement. 

The PDMA states that an authorized distributor of record is a wholesaler with an "ongoing relationship" with a manufacturer to distribute that manufacturer's drug. To become an authorized distributor, a company merely needs to receive written permission from the manufacturer. 

The net effect of the rule is that "the entire secondary wholesale industry will be completely and immediately destroyed," the groups argued in their Sept. 20 complaint before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The parties allege that the rule is unconstitutional, denying them equal protection under the law. 

Other observers have pointed out flaws in the federal statute that will undermine the rule. The agency is hamstrung by limitations in the PDMA, including the broad exemption from pedigree requirements and the lack of a federal preemption clause, Eric Greenberg, an attorney who specializes in regulatory and labeling requirements, said during a Sept. 7 audio conference sponsored by FDAnews. 

The FDA is still reviewing public comments on the rule and will soon respond to them and publish guidance to address questions about the rule, an agency spokeswoman said.

Subject:	High Taxes

  

I was interested in purchasing a home in Polk County, Florida.  The current owner is paying $1311 taxes (parid: 282817000000012050). It was recently appraised in 2005, because they had a new pool installed.  They want $335,000 for the home.  I found out if I purchase the home that the taxes could be $4895.  That is a 373% tax increase.  That is criminal! (and let’s not even consider the $3000 annual insurance — if I can get it, and <$300 for garbage pickup).

 

I have been talking with the appraiser in Bartow and one in Winter Haven.  Their estimations are different and none committal. But it is clear that they will rise substantially!

 

These high taxes will force people to move away from the area.  People that have houses will not be able to sell them.  Those that do sell them will have to take a loss. Think of the damage it will do to those in the real estate business! 

 

My brief investigation in the last three days has shown that this is exactly what is happening.  Owning a house will be a thing of the past!  I have also talked with several perspective house buyers this weekend and they discovered the same high taxes.  They also are not going to buy a house in this area!

In the last two to three years we have the largest housing price increase in the last 40 years or so.  It is not right to take that abnormal growth and still apply the old tax rules to it.  There should be a cap when the house is resold that the taxes cannot increase more then a certain percentage more then what the previous owner has paid.  A 10-15% is reasonable — not $300%+.  I am not talking about the cap on tax increases when you own the house.

 

Please let me know what you will be doing about this injustice.  I am willing to pay my own fair share of taxes, but these are far from reasonable.

Apparently whoever drew up the original Guidelines for this Program did not realize that our windows are also made of Glass, just as in a site-built or stick-built home.
                                                                      Thank You

Honorable Mr. Jeb Bush:
 
Dear Jeb I am very confused and at the same time thinking about the incapacity of the members of your Government incapable of writing down those request for voting in favor or against the proposed changes, or amendments to our State Constitution. The language used by those in the Legislative Offices, or in any other department responsible for bringing to the voters such requests do not have; either the right level of education, or bad intentions to confuse the voters. The Miami Herald which runs the State, with much respect to you, told us to vote NO for all the amendments because the futility to do so because, before our approval the Supreme Court has the last word to do so. In some of the other requests was not necessary because already was in the works, without our vote approval or disapproval. I think the whole matter is very offensive to the people of Florida. With the Herald opinions, and they should be liable for it, the whole thing is a total fiasco and disrespectfully to the people of the State of Florida. I wonder if your staff is capable to denied all the Herald opinions in this serious matter. You can see that some ads are making fun of you, because your position, one of the question about the Miami Dade Zoo looks like the County is giving away 65 Acres to the hungry developers and despise the vote; it was a done deal. Corruption is the word of order in this country of ours, never stops, and any ethical Committee sounds like it is manipulated by those corrupts people. Lobbyists run Tallahassee better than our Congress, in accordance with the political ads, because I do not know anything about and I am not accusing you or anybody else. Your time is coming down, my question: Could you do something to clarify the truth about the Constitution Amendments request? and, set up ethics standard against all kind of corruption? before your term ends. Should the Herald control the public opinion?

The dream of retiring in Florida is gone.  We own a property in Satellite Beach that we wanted to retire and in Lake Mary where I work. Satellite Beach taxes went from $3,100.00 a year to $9,000.00 in one shot. retroactive to January 2006. My taxes in Lake Mary went from $900.00 per year in 2003 to $ 4,300. in 2006. Our insurance was less of a problem, Satellite Beach  $1,100. to over $ 4,000. Lake Mary $800. to over $1,500. Financially, so we don't lose one of our homes, we are forced to sell. We currently are forced into placing the Satellite Beach property on the market for sale. With current market conditions it will be difficult. When and if it sells we will then place our Lake Mary home on the market. When it is sold we are leaving the state. It is insane what is going on. The news places the blame on the insurance industry and they are stealing less then the counties, with there outrageous increases in real estate taxes.  $3,10 0 to $9,000. in one year. Just raise the valuation and the taxpayer is screwed. ( Quote from the tax assessor office, " Your property is worth more, take out a 2nd morgage to pay your tax obligation"

    If I were a landscaper, and went to my clients in August and told them that my fee is going up from $100.00 a month to $ 300.00 a month, and by the way, it's retroactive to Jan. so you owe me an additional $ 200.00 a month from Jan through Aug. an additional $1,600.00 which totals $ 2,400.00 through Aug.then an additional $1,200.00 for the rest of the year.

I'd be charged with racketeering, conspiracy, and fraud. 

    I was Republican, you know, lower taxes then the Democrates, Wrong, looks like we are screwed either way.  I CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE IN FLORIDA, AND I'M NOT ALONG!  I WILL MISS WHAT FLORIDA WAS LIKE 20 YEARS AGO. AFFORDABLE !

Dear Governor Bush, I am really concerned about the insurance nightmare all Florida citizens are experiencing. One of the largest problems after a hurricane is the damage to electrical service for both private and commercial properties. I propose that a law be passed by the Legislature requiring that all Electrical companies furnishing electricity to private or commercial customers be required to replace all poles with concrete or aluminum poles when the old wooden poles are either destroyed or to be replaced on a regular basis. Wooden poles are the biggest cause of loss of power after any kind of storm, be it a hurricane or just a simple storm. I would suggest that the electrical companies will fight this, but it is in their financial interest as well as that of giving service to all Florida customers. C. Donald Prosser, 8115 N.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

I am writing you about Amendment 7, the disabled veterans homestead exemption.  I would like you to know that I was injured in the Marine Corps under combat operations and have been awarded 40% disability.  I also have several friends who were injured in the Iraq war, including one that lost a leg.  We all qualify for the proposed veterans disability homestead exemption, except that we are not age 65 or older.  I am asking that you change the language in the proposed amendment to include all vererans who were hurt while fighting in our nations wars.  I feel that we deserve to have this exemption just as much as any veteran who has fought for this nation, and any age requirement is an arbitrary condition to qualify for this amendment.

Please consider changing this age requirement in amendment 7.  I speak from personal experience that there are a lot of young veterans who have sacraficed life and limb while fighting in Iraq.  We have fought as hard as any other veteran while serving our nation.  Please eradicate this arbitrary language in amendment 7, and include all of the Florida veterans that have been disabled.

Sincerely,

My wife and I moved to Florida from California approximately 1 1/2 years ago
and purchased a home in a rural area of Parrish, Florida. There are few
Government Services available to us and we pay for our own water, trash
pickup, septic. We have no Children! I never see a police patrol car drive
through the neighborhood. I had 2 generators stolen and a number of my home
appliances stolen! We are taking care of an elderly parent. This new home
was intended to be my retirement home where I could enjoy the fruits of my
35 years of labor. But alas ... I was wrong!!! Today I received my property
tax bill in the amount of $11,064.45!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Although many of my neighbors have lived in their homes less than 3 years,
at least 40% of the homes in my development have "For Sale" signs on them.
My neighbors simply cannot afford to pay $10,000 or more a year in property
taxes. I cannot pay $11,064.45 a year in property taxes myself and will now
have to consider options available to me ... including moving out of State!!

We had a beautiful home in California and my property taxes were $4,800 a
year! We had full services available to us in what is considered a high tax
State. I learned; however, that California is NOT a high tax State when
compared to Florida's Property Tax structure.

The property taxes in Florida are obscene and are worthy of a taxpayer
uprising. I for one will be at the head of the line!!! People are angry. My
neighbors are angry. "I" am angry!!! Florida MUST deal with the runaway
property tax abuse of all home owners or those of you who are voted into
office will personally experience the anger of the voter/homeowners.

First, I think you are doing a great job as governor of Florida.
 
Second, I think the current methodology used to determine property taxes is detrimental to the citizens of our state and needs to be addressed and fixed.
 
Finally, I have attached an example of a tax portability methodology that I think could work and would be fair to both the taxpayer and the taxing authorities.

            Mr. Bush,

My name is Erin Slaght.  My father is a service connected combat disabled veteran with over ten years of service. He was honorably discharged. This Amendment proposing the Ad Valorem tax makes no sense to us. The property taxes allow him to be except thus far. He is not over the age of 65. We are trying to understand if the current laws are changing in regards to Veterans. Article VII, Section 6 is also tied in with the increased homestead exemption. We are hoping this amendment is not going to exclude veterans like my father, who did not enlist in Florida. Why does this amendment only include those over 65 and enlisted in Florida when entering the service? My father is 100% disabled and we are not looking forward to losing these benefits. We are all for our military and supporting our troops, whether they are from Florida or not.

            Thank You sir for any response,

Subject:	Solar Energy Rights Bill

To: The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,

I live in a community where Homeowners Association rules are the
ultimate trump card. But as we know, state government can make a
difference when it comes to important matters, such as the ability to
display the American Flag.

I have another issue that I believe is as important to the future of
our nation as maintaining the right to display the American Flag has
been. It is the right to pursue alternate energy sources as property
owners. Finding ways to reduce America's dependency on foreign oil and
other non-renewable energy sources should start at home.

Florida is the Sunshine State, but homeowners associations won't let
us harvest the sun's energy via solar panels on our roofs. Likely out
of antiquated notions of what 'look's good' in a neighborhood. What
looks good to me are whole neighborhoods doing their part to reducing
energy costs by participating in Solar Energy projects. With solar
panel efficiency improving and prices reducing, it's become time for
patriotic Americans to take advantage of this technology.

I am requesting that your office research and introduce a bill that
would forbid homeowners associations from preventing home owners and
business owners in their developments from installing solar panels on
roofs and other backyard structures. Reasonable limits would be
allowed (nothing extending off the roof structure more than 10 inches,
etc), but an outright prohibition would be illegal.

I am sure the Florida Solar Energy Center ( http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/ )
would be happy to provide you with whatever statistics and research
you need to back up your bill.

Thank you for your time and support of this important matter.

Regards

John Frost

** High Priority **

Dear Governor Bush:

An application for a state grant will come before the Cultural Facilities Board next month.  The DeBary Art League is working hard to make a much needed facility available to the underserved area of West Volusia County.  The facility will serve the communities of DeBary, Deltona, Orange City, Enterprise and Lake Helen.  The store front space now rented by the Art League offers classes to children, adults and the handicapped.  Having a dedicated facility to offer classes, after school activities, seminars, art shows and performances, will bring cultural activities where none exist.  These are the incentives that prevent problems in our young people, thereby reducing unacceptable behavior.

I have done the legal work for this group to secure the land and know first hand of their dedication to the project.  I hope we have your support for this worthy endeavor.

With best personal regards, I remain	

Very truly yours,

J. Charles Gray

Subject:	Re: law enforcement

Are you aware that our law enforcement officers are being asked to give more due to homeland security concerns, but are not given more ($$) The guys at the top may be reaping extra$$, but the  guys at the bottom aren't. Recently many Highway Patrolmen in the Orlando area left FHP for a local Sheriffs dept because they could get a little more money    It is sad to know that the highway patrol officers didn't get their intended raises, and are paid so little.  And did you know they and a lot of county sheriffs officers are earning near poverty level wages.  It is impossible for an officer to live on one salary  All of their spouses have to work to make an average living. A few communities seem to hire below par officers because well trained officers  can't live on the salary, the ones that do only do it out of dedication to their work, they should be financially rewarded for being "great". A piece of paper that says "great work" just doesn't get it. We ask them to do so much for us, can't you at least help them make a living wage?
Before you leave office, please do something really great,  Give them a significant raise ($10,000. per year) or how about something creative like allow all police officers a homestead exemption of about $100,000, or low interest rates on homes and cars.  With some professions it is possible to hold down two jobs, but with law enforcement jobs you can't, most are expected to be available 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  
Please do something.
Thanks for being a great Governor, I am sad you can not run for another 10 terms!

 Dear Mr. Bush,
           I sent you an e-mail a little more than a week ago and I have had no reply to it. I understand you are very busy but you cant be so busy that you don' have the time to read an e-mail that I sent to you and reply to it. I may not be that important in politics but my Dad was one of the people that helped to put you in office by calling people and putting up signs and telling almost everyone he meets, "Vote Jeb Bush!" If you don't have the courtesy to reply to a kids e-mail on an issue then you obviously could care less about the teachers who are fighting for a raise! In case you "didn't get the e-mail" here it is on the bottom of the message. Thank you for your time.
 
                              Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bush, 
 
      I have been hearing much about how teachers aren't getting paid enough money, and I don't understand why they get such a low salary. My Mom is a Dade County Public School teacher, and I'm always hearing about how we are having financial problems. My Mom and Dad are always talking about how we can't do certain things, like I can't go on many school field trips because we can't afford it. The way I see it, teachers should be payed the most because if it weren't for teachers you and I wouldn't know anything. I wouldn't be sending this e-mail to you if it weren't for teachers. Teachers are the reason society can progress and grow. When my Mom was teaching in Mi! chigan she was paid about triple what she is being payed here! I don't understand why you don't make some room for teachers in the budget. This is an important issue to me so please reply. Thank you for your time.
 
                                   Sincerely,

My name is mrs. Da silva.I am a retired senior citizen(alone) here in the Port Saint Lucie area. 
This e-mail is sent to your office advising you of the high taxes and cost of living in this city. 
I moved here 2 years ago from the Boca Raton area.My first year in this city I received a tax bill on my home for $6.200 I don't live in a fancy neighbor hood or on a canal, just a street .I nearly past out when I saw the tax bill.If I had known the taxes where that high I would have stayed in Boca.I cannot continue to pay these insane taxes here.I called the city, the tax collectors, disputing my taxes was told the milleage was $2.600 per $100.000.My home was assest at $260.000 There was a lot attached to my property that i gave to my son to take the taxes off the property from the house.I see now why there are so many foreclosures on homes.I feel sorry for these people.But does Jeb Bush care ??????Apparently not.You are chasing your residence out of your state.The surrounding cities out side of st Lucie, taxes are much lower.The surrounding states to Florida the taxes are less.The city of Port Saint lucie has nothing to offer,no good paying jobs,you have to go to Palm beach in order to find a decent paying job, so we can pay the cities insane taxesI am barely making it here.The groceries are double, i don't understand the same store like Walmart and Publix, in Palm beach there prices are half.My tax bill for the 2006 tax year is $4.500 still high,(because I gave my son the property next to me).I cannot continue to pay these outrages amounts,and no way will this state take my home because of it.The city of PT ST Lucie has a bunch of old seneor citizens on the board whom have lived in this city for 20 years who are no affected by the outrageous taxes here,This is what I hear from the city, let the new comers pick up the difference ,that is not right.They have nothing better to do but sit on the comittee of how they are going to raise our taxes so they don't have to pay it.I hope the governors office will look into this, before you have a dissaster on youre hands, right now I have a petition going against the high taxes here.I hope mr. Bush  will do some thing about it.We will think about voting him back into office. 

I hope to hear from some there letting me know that there is a governor  who cares. 

Thank you.

Hi Governor,
Good morning. When you were running for your second term you were taking questions at a FL Assoc of Truckers luncheon in Orlando. I got up and told you that there is a Bonding Program run by FDOT to help small contractors with Bonding but the limit was $250,000 for the whole State and once a bond has been issued against that limit the program stops until that project is completed and the bond released.
 
Of course $250,000 is better than nothing but is certainly very inadequate for the Billions of Tax Dollars spent every year. You promised that you would do something about increasing the program because it is an excellent Idea. My comment then was " Governor, I notice you are making lots of promises but nobody is taking notes" and you said " I have an excellent memory I do not need to take notes". Well here we are 2006. You are getting ready to leave office and as far as I know the program is still $250,000.
 
Do you still have an excellent memory and remembered that conversation? Do still have an excellent memory but just decided not to do anything about it or you did you forget?
 
Just in case you wish to respond my phone number is 407-832-5214 and of course you do have my email address.
 
Thanks Gov. and good bye.

Dear, Mr. Bush
 
Hello my name is Yaremis Albernas and I'am a 10th grade student in G. Homles Braddock Senior High. I know that you are probably sick and tired of hearing all the arguments and saying's about the teacher salary increase. I'am not here to brag it on to you but i do wish for you to hear me out, for like all of you adults know i'am the future of this country. I know that it will be difficult to raise the teacher's salaries but you have to realize that we would not be here if it wernt for the teachers who brought knowledge into our souls. Showed us how to count, add, subtract, multiply ect... You may not know this but teachers hav a incredible impact on student's life's as well. For ex. I wanted to drop out of  school because i did not think that i was going to make it, not just one but 3 teacher's inspired me to stay and here iam now. One of my teacher's has inspired me to write, and help's all of her students see the importance of speaking up and our right's. For these teacher's  are very rare to find. I believe that teaching is a life changing life such as of a doctor, they hold the patients life in thier hands right? Well teachers are the same, they shape us, mold us, to the adults that we become later on.I dont mean to be disrespectful but you and Mr. Bush wouldnt be presidents or governers without having teachers. Its injustice to which garbage pick up workers recieve more money then of these LIFE DOCTORS, its even insulting. Teachers deserve this raise because they work 5 days a week sometimes more because they need the MONEY from early in the morning to late afternoon's. Having to deal with some ungratituded students who make thier job harder, and just get only 30 - something $.  It makes me sad to be part of  America because of this insulting issue to which affects not only teachers but students as well. Teachers help the future if you help them want to help the future. PLease read this letter and think about what i have said and think about the teacher's that teach your children or enything. Please think about teachers and on our futures. A future without teachers is a dark, sad depressive future for amercia.
 
Sincerely

Mr. Bush,
 
I have backed every unpopular decision the the president and republicans have made the past 20 years. The lack of intervention in our personal lives was always a key to my Republican voting roots. However the recent absurd legislation passed prohibiting online gambling which was initiated and backed by several key Republican Senators and signed into law by the president is an insult and slap in the face to those of us who have endured endless taunting and critisism the past several years. To use the ruse of terrorist activity or of being potential an "adictive" family destructive vice  is not only absurd, its down right insulting to the majority of Republican supporters. 
 
Why are states allowed to continue to run lotteries, why are Vegas and Atlantic City still operating, why are Indian Casinos right here in this state along with Dog and Horse tracks and Jai alai sill open. Obviously it's the tenticles of the legalized gambling establishments recalling some  past due favors. Why stop with Gambling? Why not reinstitute prohibition? 
 
As if the inability to place small wages on events to add enjoyment to our routine lives was not enough "punishment" most of the existing online sites have decided to use this legislation to close up and take off with our monies on deposit. All you have done is to push the really hard core gamblers back to the illegal bookies who DO NOT require deposits upfront and from whom truely addictive personalities end up in more serious trouble then simple financial problems.
 
I will be doing something I NEVER THOUGHT MYSELF CAPABLE OF....... I WILL BE VOTING DEMOCRATIC THIS ELECTION. IF THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT REPEALED BY NEXT ELECTION I WILL CONTINUE TO VOTE AGAINST THE IMCUMBANT PARTY UNTILL IT IS REPEALED.

no but I will focus on the one that I know best as I am a Scholar Scientist 
at the FSU Coastal & Marine Laboratory.  Dredging a two-mile long channel 
offshore through the Big Bend Seagrasses Aquatic Preserve will result in

totally unacceptable because transplanting seagrass does not work.  Please 
allow at least one area of Florida to remain undeveloped and in its natural

Well, I attended the court hearing and Mr McCormick never showed. The judge has done nothing to help with this matter. I recieved a payment in August  2006 and nothing since then. I do  not understand how this man gets away from the Okaloosa County Court system. He is going to school to become a Okaloosa County Sheriff Officer and yet can't even pay his child support. I really do not understand how the system works. I have been dealing with the Children and Families of the state for 6 yrs trying to get help with my situation. I know you are going to tell me to call the 1-800-622-5437 hotline and they can help me but they don't. I am past frustrated now and I really would like someone to explain to me how all this is legal and at all possible to go this way. I don't know who else to ask or even ask advice from. I don't have the financial stability to hire an attorney. I just need someone to explain to me please.

Subject:	HOA vs CONDO Law-Enough Study-Let's do Topic#3

Thank you Ms. Windham!  Your note was just what I needed to catch up.
 
Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
I appreciate the need to study issues before acting, but this one is beyond critical.  Catastrophic losses are still accumulating thanks to the utterly inadequate legal/regulatory structure of FL State Statute 720.00 HOAs & 718.00 Condos.  You just can't see them because there is no way for them to surface in a systematic recognizable fashion.
 
Currently, my Additional Living Expense outlay since Hurricane Charley is approximately $35,000 in lost income.  My HOA has failed to resolve rebuild issues in a timely fashion, the work they have done is inadequate (because the codes are inadequate), and my roof is still leaking.  I retained an attorney in 01/06, and while it calmed me down and may have provided indirect leverage, it did not affect their decisionmaking at all.  I have endured absent communication from the CAM, the CAM failing to follow instructions, repeated trespass on my property, vandalism, theft, and construction damage from unmonitored work... and I am not home yet.
 
I helped another H-C survivor who's Condo took the insurance money and refurbished the Condo Board's buildings while failing to restore his... He and 3 other unit owners are still out of their homes and the Condo board wants to roll the remaining insurance money into the reserves.  How can this be??

From a former Board Treasurer perspective, I support devoting taxpayer resources to Topic 3. Fooling around with the other two is a waste of time because:

    a) HOA Volunteer Board Mgmt - The demographics no longer exist to support fully functioning volunteer HOA boards.  Working people (or w/families) have no time.  The older generation of retired motivated former execs/mgrs from the 1950's - 60's are dead or dying now.
 
    b) HOA Education - Even if you CAN find people to serve on the volunteer HOA Boards, they have to learn the HOA statutes and then constantly clarify for owners who have been in condos, how their old condo rules no longer apply.
 
    c) HOA Education - HOA Boards have attorneys and a set of docs.  They have a few old time members with an oral history of varying reliability and a vast majority who really could care less.  So how would improved educational options apply?  We don't have any to begin with.
 
    d) HOA Dispute Resolution - Even if an owner can find an attorney (very difficult), the attorney just waits the situation out and collects fees.   This has been my personal experience as an owner and I have observed my HOA endure the exact same treatment in going after owners legally.
 
    e) FL Construction Law - Does not support the individual or common interest entity.  Another legal sink hole for attorney's line their pockets.
 
I realize that the public comment time for HB.391 is over, but I do want you to know that your recommendation to re-study the issues further, w/o pursuing Topic 3 directly at this time, makes me very frustrated.  Please focus on Topic 3 exclusively and let's get a move on.
 
Joe Adams of Becker & Poliakoff did a wonderful article series in The Snooze Press that details the subtle and not-so-subtle regulatory differences between the statutes.  So the regulatory comparison work is finished for the most part.   
 
Please note:  The ONLY educational opportunity I could find after H-Charley was B&P's seminar at Seven Lakes.  In spite of 12 pages of notes, I did not succeed in managing the Genl Contractor who failed to perform and abandoned.  The reason was that I failed to manage the HOA Board and CAM manager who did NOT take the time to attend the seminar with me and who refused to learn the process and follow it.
 
The cynic in me bets that the developers will drive the reg-neg bus and the end product will screw the people once again.  Please make me wrong.

Dear Mr. Porter:

 

Thank you for your recent email to Governor Jeb Bush regarding condominium laws in Florida.  Secretary Simone Marstiller has asked that our division respond directly to you on her behalf.  We appreciate this opportunity to assist you. 

 

In his veto letter of HB391, the Governor directed the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) to conduct a study and make recommendations regarding the following issues: 

 

1. Ways to improve and/or expand existing alternative dispute resolution and education programs to accommodate stricter association requirements such as those set forth in House Bill 391.

 

2. The extent to which protections afforded members of mandatory homeowner associations can approach parity with those afforded condominium owners while still upholding the legislative intent that homeowners’ associations not be regulated.

 

3. Whether, using the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act (UCOIA) as a starting point and analyzing the laws of other states, the State of Florida should move toward establishing a comprehensive common interest realty law.

 

The department solicited comments from the public, and met with stakeholders representing community associations, unit owners, developers, and management companies on September 6, 2006, to discuss these issues.  This information was analyzed and compiled into a report, which was submitted to Governor Bush on October 1, 2006.  I have attached a copy of this report for your review; you may also access the full report (including attachments) and the veto letter on our website at http://www.myflorida.com/dbpr/lsc/condominiums/index.shtml.

 

I hope this information proves to be helpful.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Hi There, 
Could you tell me the name of the Committee or Study Group that is focusing on a possible regulatory standardization between Condos and HOAs?

This issue is critical to me (and several other folks I know).   Our HOA needs to be a condo.  It was made an HOA because doing so in 1985 was cheaper and the developer wanted to save $.   If the laws can be made the same - and I wish they were - we could avoid time-consuming conversion discussions.

PS I have been out of my townhouse since H-Charley, in part, thanks to the HOA and the CAM manager and some really inept and corrupt contractors.

On 09/04/98 Kevin John Fischer was killed in the line of duty while assisting a fellow Volusia County Sheriff Deputy who was involved in a minor crash on Interstate 95, at the 92 exit to Daytona Beach. While waiting for a wrecker Officer Fischer, who was a motorcycle officer at the time, was struck by an out of control north-bound vehicle and killed instantly. I know many years have passed, however; his legacy at the Daytona Beach Police Department continues. The request is that a "Memorial Highway" on a stretch of roadway (95 or 92) near where Officer Fischer was killed be named after him. This would be such a great honor for Kevin's family. Kevin was also a Gulf War Veteran for the Air Force. I contacted Congressman John Mica's Office, however, they advised me to contact your office. Thank you for the consideration.

Subject:	State Employee Raise






Dear Governor Bush,

Prior to year 2005, the annual raise had been a minimum of $1,000 or the
percentage whichever was greater.  Last year the legislature approved a
bigger raise than normal, 3.6 percent, and I think it was due to a surplus
of money in the budget.  That was great for all the employees making
$27,777.77 a year or more.  However the rest of us making less than that
did not get the $1,000 minimum.  If there was a surplus of money in the
budget, why was the minimum $1,000 annual raise removed?

This year with a 3.0 percent raise, one would have to make at least
$33,333.33 a year to achieve the $1,000 minimum.

The minimum $1,000 comes to an amount of $2.74 a day and does not even
cover the cost of the increase of gasoline itself not to mention the cost
of living increase of everything else!

While I am very happy with my job/career, and agree it is my own fault and
choosing to work for low wages, I do not begrudge anyone who has far
exceeded the average state wage and am happy for them.  I am just curious
why the minimum was removed.

Dear Governor Bush,
I know you must be aware of the poor handling of the teachers' situation in Miami-Dade.  Please be our voice and help us.  Our salaries have been frozen for approximately 4 years.  We have been told that there is no money.  However, there has been money to give high position personnel a substantial increase in pay every year.  (also, renovations costing over hundreds of thousands in the district office) You know that our cost of living has increased including our health benefits and yet our salaries remain the same.  There should be an audit at the district level.  Someone outside the circle that can maybe find the funds and allocate it appropriately.

I am forwarding you several messages that have been circling through our sites.  However, you can be better informed if you  get the minutes from the School Board Meeting from last Wednesday, October 11, 2006
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this plea.

 Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would like to know if there is any type of relief coming to homeowners in the way of an increase in Homestead exemptions? 
 
I purchased a home back in 1994  for 54,900 and was granted an exemption of $25,000.00. That was a great help for a blue collar girl!
 
I recently purchased a house and the exemption remains the same even thought housing prices have soared!
 
We need to help our young people realize their dreams too and I can't see how then can with the taxes on property what they are. My son is 20 and is purchasing his first home for $140,000.00 ( modest by today's standards)his property taxes are 2355.00!!! That's an additional $196.25 a month for taxes!! 
 
We can't let the American dream slip away from our young people Governor.
 
Sincerely,
Susan Livingston

Dear Mr. Bush,




My name is Audrey Warfield; I am a student at St.Petersburg College. In my 
speech class I was given an assignment to address an issue and then try to 
resolve it with several ideas. I and some of my classmates have come to 
realize our nation’s problem with homelessness. First we thought of taking 
.5% from property taxes that way your properties value will actually raise 
because it will be keeping people from living off the streets. But seeing 
what a touchy subject property taxes are right now we came up with another 
idea. We were thinking we could add five cents to the purchase of car tags. 
A small amount of money but people have to renew them once a year. This 
money will provide shelter for these homeless and employ the people needed 
to help them get back on their feet. Not every homeless person is mentally 
handicap or drug addicted. Some are families living out of cars or people 
who have just hit a low in their life and need help.

Whether we like it or not these people are our people and we should be 
taking care of our own. I was hoping you could tell me how you feel on the 
subject and what steps I would have to take to follow through with this 
plan.




Sincerely,




Audrey Warfield

MIAMI - Thousands of Miami-Dade County teachers ditched school Wednesday to make a pitch for higher pay, and several teachers aired their opinions at a school board meeting. The United Teachers of Dade called on teachers to rally in support of higher salaries as the school board prepared to hold a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday afternoon.

More than 8,000 protesters gathered on streets throughout the county as well as at the Miami-Dade Public Schools headquarters. Some of the protesters chanted "We need a raise." 

Teachers argue that their salaries are not high enough, saying teachers in Miami-Dade are some of the lowest paid in South Florida. 

"We work hard and we want our money," one teacher said. 
"This is an absolute disgrace that we as teachers and professionals, educators, have to be out on the street to get a small raise," said teacher Suzan Godoy. 

The starting salary for a teacher in Miami-Dade County is $34,000. In Monroe County, the starting salary is $40,000 and it's $37,000 in Broward County. 

Teachers compiled a list of school administrators throughout the county with six-figure salaries, while teachers in the classroom, they said, cannot afford to pay their bills. 

Godoy, who is a single mother, said she just doesn't make enough. 
"My electric bill has gone up. My food bill has doubled. I am having a tough time making ends meet as a single mom," Godoy said. 

"We're very upset because the cost of living has been so high and our salaries haven't been raised, so we're basically living on poverty level," said teacher Anthony Kontos. 

"We believe there is an adequate amount of dollars here to be able to settle this and to be able to craft a deal that ultimately gets a good settlement in November," Superintendent Rudy Crew said. "We thought that $40,000 in a place as expensive as Miami really is more respectful of the work." 

There was no discussion on the agenda of the School Board of Miami-Dade County's meeting Wednesday about contract negotiations. 

"I believe very strongly that we'll be able to come together in the next month or so and bring before the board and, frankly, our community a settlement package that reflects what we all really want for teachers and what is a fair and equitable package," Crew said earlier in the day. 

Teachers spoke out during a public hearing portion of the school board meeting. 
"The number of teachers who are finding themselves in serious financial difficulty and even filing for bankruptcy is outrageous. It is also a disgrace," teacher David Kirsner said. "This crisis has been manufactured by this school board through bad planning, misplaced priorities and poor fiscal management." 

Contract talks between the district and the union have been going on for weeks. School board member Marta Perez said she is confident a compromise will be reached. 

"There has to be more thrift in the budget and live within our means so that we can provide for our teachers," Perez said. 

"We do understand economics. We teach it, and our salaries are no longer competitive," said Karen Aronowitz, president of the United Teachers of Dade. 

The next bargaining session is planned for Oct. 19.

To whom It may concern:

 

I am currently an owner of a duplex in the city of Miami (Dade County, FL).  I would like to via my governor’s office

What options do I have available to me in order to inquire as to why my taxes have been increasing +10% for the past 5 years.  I currently will be paying roughly $8,000 in taxes for this year and cannot seem to get any answers form my local city officials.  Between the taxes and insurance policies of $4000+ per year I pay almost more than my mortgage.  Who can I turn to in order to help me with this problem?  Should I turn to my representative or senator?  If this continues I am in danger of losing my home.  Many people in Dade-County are seeing this problem and no solutions or help are given to those in need.

I would appreciate some guidance with this matter.

Have you heard the breaking news- the insurance industry is preparing to announce record profits later this week? Wow! What a stunner!
 
Well, not really. That's pretty much what any sane person would expect to happen when you have a state (Florida) allowing insurance companies to rate premium on a series of unprecedented events (8 storms in 2 years). This will happen every year that the unprecedented events do not occur. Unprecedented means those events do not occur very often, as in never before.
 
Enough with the band-aids. Enough with the task forces. Enough with public meetings. CALL A SPECIAL SESSION AND FIX THIS.
 
The problem is obvious and the answer is equally obvious. The state is already in the 'insurance business' up to their eyeballs. The only problem is the state only participates in losses and not profits. This is absurd and needs to stop immediately. Record profits for the insurance industry while the state will be bailing out Poe for years. What is wrong with this picture? 
 
Had the state acted with the sense of urgency it should have and taken over all wind risk by this past June 1, there would already be a massive war chest for next year instead of huge insurance industry bonuses and shareholder profits.
 
As a free market / the smaller the government the better proponent, the very concept of state run anything troubles me. However, the market has become completely dysfunctional and the state is the only entity positioned to restore it quickly. Free market forces might eventually fix things but the operative word here is 'eventually'. People are losing homes now. We do not have 3 or 5 or 10 years to get this fixed.
 
THE STATE AND ONLY THE STATE CAN RETAIN SURPLUS PREMIUM FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS OR SURCHARGE TO MAKE UP DEFICITS. THIS ELIMINATES THE RATINGS GUESSING GAME. IT IS WHAT IT IS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR BUREAUCRATIC INEFFICIENCIES AND CORRUPTION, COMPLETE STATE RUN WIND INSURANCE WOULD BE FAR CLOSE TO RATING ACTUAL RISK THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW AT.
 
There is no reason solution can not be achieved by January when you leave. While Citizens does have a poor name, it already exists, it writes new policies every day, and state insurance is state insurance regardless of the name.  They could start writing one new policy statewide (there is no meaningful differential as to wind risk anywhere in this state) with rates in the middle of 2003 rates and current rates immediately. If this leaves surplus premium (as it would have this year) it is put in the bank for next year. If losses actually did exceed premium collected, then a modest rate increase next year plus surcharges to make up the deficit. 
 
Our crisis would effectively be over had this been implemented for 2006.
 
As it now stands, with the insurance industry's risk exposure vs. their premium intake, they operate with no risk and a 'state guaranteed' long term profit.
 
Respectfully from a two-time supporter,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I sent a previous e-mail which was done in a bit of frustration and I apologize for that .  I learned the hard way that the higher you go as far as responsibility and public service the more difficult the decisions that you have to make.  I may not have always agreed with you, but I do understand and if nothing else nobody can say that you haven't stuck to your principals.  For that I admire and respect you more than I could express.  The original e-mail was in response to our concern over teacher salaries and our frustration over negotiations.  
 
My question to you is as follows;  I know that under state law we as public employees are not allowed to strike,  and those that do could or would be fired.  Just like the air traffic controllers who were fired under the Reagan administration.  My question is about amending the State of Florida Constitution.  If we we generate enough interest throughout the state can we get an amendment on the ballot that would allow public employees who are union members the same rights as other union members, among which is the ability to strike when all attempts at bargaining fail.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration

Subject:	RE: Teacher Salaries

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As you may already know, there is some contention at this time over the salaries for teachers in Miami-Dade.  The School Board once again claims there are no funds, though this is nothing new.  We can look to many causes for the shortage of cash, but much of it is due to the redistribution of funds recently to balance funding to other counties.  Both you and I have lived in the Miami area and the Tallahassee area, and we both know there is a dramatic difference in the cost of living.  This is even reflected in teacher's salaries, as Leon County teachers make less money (I have taught in both counties).  While teacher's pay is less in most predominantly rural and suburban counties (including Leon), the cost of living is much lower in those counties, and the cost of operating schools is considerably less.  This puts counties such as ours at a great disadvantage.  
 
While I realize you will be leaving office soon, our next governor (most likely Crist), may need some guidance on this issue.  Please consider your cost of living in each of these counties if this issue is to come up.  While the redistribution was a real help for smaller communities, it really hurt our urban areas.  Thank you for your time and consideration on this issue.

Honorable Governor Bush: I just received an e-mail from Commissioner Evelyn Greer. She informs me if Miami-Dade county raises taxes, the state sends less money for education down here. Also, I did not know the lottery money goes into a general fund instead of directly into education.
 
It seems to me, Miami-Dade county is not getting a fair share of the tax and lottery monies collected by the State. Can you tell me why and what is being done to change the disparity?  Thank you,

Subject:	your position on global warming

Dear Gentlemen,

 

I am trying to find my representatives’ positions on global warming.  Please take a moment to respond.  

 

Specifically, what is your position on a mandatory national cap for global warming pollution?  Do you support a mandatory national cap; support voluntary emission reduction goals for businesses to set their own pollution reduction targets; think global warming is a serious issue, but one that requires more study before we set a hard cap; or, perhaps, you do not think global warming is a real problem. 

 

Beyond a national cap on global warming pollution, do you have other ideas on how to fight global warming? Some suggestions include funding for research and development of cleaner alternative fuels; raising fuel economy standards for automobiles, implementing programs to help increase energy efficiency and conservation in the U.S.; encouraging carbon sequestration; increasing funding for fuel cell technology; and/or providing funding for biofuels.  Maybe you have some other ideas as well.

 

I would appreciate hearing your position on this issue.  I am an active voter in St. Augustine.  I am concerned about environmental issues, particularly as they may affect the future health of this country and its children.  I do not automatically believe in all environmental causes, but I do believe there is much we can do in our own self interest, provided we are willing to look ahead, beyond the next election, even beyond our lifetimes.

 

Thank you for your service on my behalf and for your attention to this matter.

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Over the past two years, property insurance rates have dramatically increased - this not only affects me, as a homeowner, but also as anowner of a timeshare property.  Florida Law requires that my timeshare owners association insure my timeshare property for full replacement value, leaving little room for negotiation with the insurance companies or reductions in coverage.
 
As a timeshare owner, my concerns with these unprecedented insurance increase include:
 
1.    How does the State of Florida plan on increasing the number of insurance carriers, thereby giving timeshare associations more choices with            
       carriers?  What can be done to decrease costs or place reasonable limits on increases in premiums?
 
2.    Hurricanes have been a known weather condition in the state for years.  Why have the issues of increasing premiums and decreasing number of
       insurance carriers not been addressed before?
 
3.    What can be done to help timeshare and condominium associations take steps to improve their properties and provide better protections from severe
       storms?  How can such improvements be taken into account in determining appropriate premiums and deductibles?
 
4.    The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program provides free inspections and grants to individual homeowners, but what is
       being done to help timeshares, condominiums and businesses?
 
As a timeshare ownere, I appreciate your commitment to protecting the future of Florida's tourism and hospitality industries - and individual owners like myself.

Subject:	Property Taxes

I am sure, I am not the only one complaining about property taxes. But since we have moved to Florida, the unfairness of the taxes is more than apparent.
 
We live on a street that has access to water. The homes about the same size being built back in the 60's/70's. However, the taxes are far from being in a similar range.
 
I have thought about how to make the taxes more equitable and here are my thoughts.
 
Major Problem: Accessed value of a property should not be used as the tax basis.
                        This is very inequitable and too volatile.
 
My Plan: Assign each property - PROPERTY  TAX  UNITS
 
Residential:
1. Units based on the square foot of the enclosed house/shed/garage
2. Units based on the square foot of the land
3. Additional units for: swimming pools (they use valuable water)
4. There can be a homestead rebate
 
Businesses:
1. Units based on the square foot of the Business floor
2. Units based on the square foot of the land
 
Farms:
1. Units based on the square foot of the enclosed house/barn/shed/gargage/other
2. Units based on the square foot of the land
3. Additional units for: use of water
 
Property taxes should be levied on the number of units a house has, once calculated and assigned, no adjustment need to be made unless additions are made to the structures.
 
Each municipality should then develop it's budget, and the taxes be allocated based on the number of units of each type of taxable property. Total budget divided by total units will give the cost per unit, which is the same for everyone. Times that by the # of Property Tax Units will tell each household what they owe.
 
Everyone would then be paying taxes on an even plain, not what we have today. Everyone receive basically the same benefits from the city/state despite what they "live-in" so make the system more fair.
 
My ideas.

Dear, Governor Jeb Bush, my name is Alejandro Capote and I’m a student at Miami Lakes Educational Center in the Cambridge Academy for criminal justice.

I’m contacting you because there is an issue that I will like you to solve. As you probably know, 

The superintended of Miami Dade public school, doesn’t want to increase 

the salaries of teachers. The teacher have guided us the student to the path of leadership and success. 

I expect that you as governor tried to increase the salary. If the superintended of Miami Dade 

Doesn’t increase the salaries of teachers, then we the student will take things into are own hands 

And we will strike. I don’t know who put the superintended of Miami Dade public school to that position, but I know it was a wrong mistake. 

 

Sincerely, Alejandro Capote

Please help the teachers, or we the student will strike, until teacher salaries are increase.

Subject:	A matter of interest

I realize your term is nearly over, and I wonder if you would consider going out with a bang. I am upset because a neighbor told me today that he and his wife plan to do something that I am also considering. When his wife retires, because he is unable to work, they plan to move to Alabama. My parents live with me and are helping with expenses, but when they die (he is 90 and she is 87), I am thinking I will have to move there also.  The reason? High taxes and homeowners insurance. 
 
The worst to me is the insurance. Our area seldom has hurricane damage, yet my insurance more than doubled. I have been informed that I cannot drop it unless I cancel all my homeowners insurance. While that is not an option, it did cross my mind. I cannot pay nearly $3,000 insurance for a $114,000 policy. This year I managed. Next year I may be looking at south or central Alabama property. 
 
Also, I strongly resent paying a fee to support multi-millionaires who are ignorant enough to build on sand in a hurricane path. I should supplement this stupidity? I came from central Alabama and our area was riddled with sinkholes. There were certain sections that the major companies would not cover for sinkhole and the few who would charged astronomical fees. My solution was simple - if I found a house in one of those areas that I really, really wanted I would have one of three choices: Either do without the sinkhole insurance, buying only basic homeowners, or pay the high fees - with no help from anyone else, or forget about the house and find one somewhere else. No one came forward and offered to put money in a pot so I could buy insurance on an uninsurable property. Nor did I expect them to.
 
The Republican party would gain strong following if this issue were addressed within the year. Please consider taking some action on this. Florida is on the road to losing its working class in favor of moneyed tourists and people who have 2nd and 3rd homes here but contribute nothing of intrinsic value to the state.
 
Thank you for your time.

Subject:	Save our citrus

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
Have you read an AP article in today's online edition of the Tampa 
Tribune about the federal government's forecast for the lowest citrus 
crop output since 1990?
http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/newswire/comments/orange_forecast_in_the_red/

I have an idea to help reverse this trend.
Redirect part of the impact fees that developers pay when a former 
citrus grove is removed to make way for a planned development. Use this 
redirected money as follows:
1. Tax credits to inspire farmers to expand their citrus groves;
2. Tax credits to plant new groves;
3. Research & development at our universities to help make our crops 
more disease resistant.
4. Education grants to help Florida students in financial need complete 
an education in a field of study that promotes Florida's citrus industry
5. Grants for job assistance to Florida college graduates who show 
promise wanting to enter a career in the Florida citrus industry.

Now my next idea might be a little controversial but here it is:
Make current non-violent inmates work out their sentences as teams of 
agricultural workers, to give local labor assistance to farmers who are 
experiencing a shortage of migrant workers due to immigration issues.
Thank you for taking the time to read this article and consider my ideas.

Mr. Bush,
 
Please consider the following. What a way to end your tenure as Florida's governor than to take action on Florida's property tax problem.
 
Maybe an end to the madness that is the Florida property tax system would be to adopt something similar to what California has enacted.
 
Under California Proposition 13, the real estate tax on a parcel of residential property is limited to 1% of its assessed value, until the property is resold. This "assessed value", however, may only be increased by a maximum of 2% per year. This applies to all real estate, and not just homesteaded properties.
 
Proposition 13 passed with 65% of those who voted in favor and with the participation of 70% of registered voters. After passage, it became article 13A of the California state constitution. Its passage resulted in a cap on property tax rates in the state, reducing them by an average of 57%. In addition to lowering property taxes, the initiative also contained language requiring a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses for future increases in all state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates.

Dear Governor Bush;
 
Like all consumers I am frustrated and angered by the issues of insurance in the State of Florida.  I have been an insurance agent in Florida for 20+ years.  I am upset for the customers that I have worked hard to earn their trust, only to have companies throughout Florida, and the company I represent, cancel them with no alternatives but Citizens.  We have got to find solutions.  People are deciding to stay in Florida, in their homes, even though they will not continue their insurance. Simply put, many on fixed incomes, can not afford it!  If a disaster of even one hurricane or tropical storm should damage their home, they will have no place to turn, with probably only developers to move in.  I could go on, but I would rather work towards a solution.
 
A few months back you expressed disappointment with many of the Democrats who suggested that you haven't done anything.  Some Republicans expressed some displeasure too.  Mr. Bush, you really haven't done anything, however it isn't your fault; lets blame Wilma, Charley, Jeanne, Andrew, etc.... obviously I could go on and on, and thank the Lord we didn't have Katrina!  You asked for somebody to come up with recommendations for solutions.  Nobody came forward.  Gallagher was messing with a solution through the FWUA, and the FJUA and now Citizens.  As I see it, he was siding with the Insurance industry and the profits that they WILL make.  We the consumer, however will have to  pay.  Ten more years of payments to the Citizens Recoupement Fee?  Truly there has to be a solution. A solution for the protection of the consumer in a disaster, without having to go broke to insure that possibility. Insurance is based on the law of large numbers; (one only has to look at the large $ numbers building on our coasts).  What is the solution?
 
Is it a National Catastrophe Fund??  Will Wisconsin share in the expenses for a Hurricane Disaster in Florida?  Yeah, probably not.  Will Texas chip in through this fund, to help spare those unfortunates in San Francisco when the big earthquake hits???  I don't think that you will be able to reach a national consensus in enough time to fund the next disaster.  
 
It is my thought that it has to be resolved on a state by state basis.  Simply put; set up the Florida Hurricane Authority...... a not for profit organization, that will be established to help our Florida citizens.  MAKE/FORCE the insurance companies to take back windstorm and hail onto their polices.  Heck, they are not concerned if a couple of homes are knocked over in a storm, however they can't afford to replace a community or string of communities in a major catastrophic event.  When I am suggesting a Hurricane policy, I am recommending it be from all causes of loss, including "rising waters"!  Hurricane will be the proximate cause of loss.  With a Hurricane Policy, constituents make one claim to one authority....they do not have to run around town wondering where their insurance carrier is and whether they have coverage.  The adjusters could go out in one unit, to the damaged area, saddled with the information for their prescribed 'damage zone' and with the ability to write checks on the spot.  Regulated by the State Government, gouging in a disaster situation by contractors could virtually be eliminated. We would all be saying and doing the same thing, to help those who are struggling.
 
I have had these ideas running through my head for years and it's funny, but it took a Democrat to suggest that we need a 'local' fund that could accumulate in good years, to help fund the bad years.  This democrat seems to be grasping at straws to gather votes, however..... Can my idea for a solution be that simple?
 
Look at the values of the properties on our beaches.  Since our local zoning boards and legislators have been ineffective in suggesting limits on the values permitted to be developed in exposed areas, it may be time for those most exposed, most vulnerable..."to belly up to the bar"!  Arcadia, Lakeland got hit 3 times during 2004, it only took one to make them hurt.  However, the damage values monetarily they endured, probably only equaled the value of a half-mile stretch of land on Casey Key in Sarasota County.
 
I truly believe this can be a step in finding a solution.  An immediate solution!  We are at the end of a Hurricane Season and unfortunately your term as Governor.  Look at this close!  Residents in Florida need some relief and reassurance that they will be made whole after a storm, without having to go broke or move.  Your constituents, my customers need relief.
 
Thank your for your years of service as our Governor of the Great State of Florida!!!  
 
Warmest personal regards,

Greetings Mr Bush
 I am emailing you on a concern of property taxes--yes
it's out of control if you are a resident. I believe
in fair play. I just finished my petition
property/adjustment and talk about bad court.  They
blame everything on the State on why they can't be
fair. I tried comparing Just Value to my neighbors but
they had Homestead in place (I was just able to force
mine in -FL Dept of Revenue helped serve to me on a
platter because Assessors office lied to me about
conditions of applications) and comparison was
disallowed by State Statutes, according to the
Franklin County Assessors office. 
 The reading on the wall is PAY! Ignore taxpayers
complaints. I sat through two days of VAB public
hearings and got my education in Franklin Co.  They
stand by the property sales to make all of Franklin
county pay higher taxes--period.  Franklin County
property sales were at a record high in early 2005,
even though there were less than 1% of homes on the
market sold in the second half of 2005.  Hurricane
Dennis devastated the town where I live - Franklin
County said they cannot take into consideration on
January 1 because of State Statutes.
  Doris Pendleton, Property Appraiser (850) 653-9236

I would like to thank you in advance for taking this
into consideration when reviewing what your
constituants are dealing with. 
You're the man, hopefully maybe there is something you
can help with.

I have a thought on the homeowner's insurance. I have read that a 'catastrophe fund' is wanted to be set up and funded.
Why couldn't there be either a 1/2 or 1 cent gasoline tax that just provided a catastrophe fund? It would be constantly refurbished, many would contribute to it and no one could escape paying it. I think it should build up rather quickly. Then have a panel of people to decide when and how it was spent. This to include insurance agents that would alternate a time period, a few  from the general population and some government people.
If there is no way to do this I would appreciate you telling my why it wouldn't work.
At the rate the insurance companies are going they are going to wipe out our state. I love living here but to own a 2600 sq. ft. home in a nice neighborhood and have State Farm charging me over 7000.00 a year for homeowner's is rediculous and will force us to leave and I am sure many others. I have tried to find other insurance and am told to stay where I am there is nothing else.
Hopefully as your last hurrah from office something like this could be done!

 Dear Governor Bush:
 
 
Please consider the advantages of returning the legislature to a special session this week or next week to deal witrh the insurance (and possibly tax issues) before the election.  You have the authority, since this is a crisis situation (everyone on both sides of every campaign and race says so).  The traveling commission is a joke, nothing valuable can come from that which will survive the politics as usual routine in the next session.
 
First, there are a number of legislators that will not be returning after this year-- they have nothing political to lose by doing the right thing and fixing the system.  Those camapignning have everything to gain by doing the right thing.  You would have unprecedented and absolute power to force them to come up with a viable solution, since they will want to get back to the campaign trail quickly, and they cannot campaign while in session.
 
The lobbyists would be caught off-guard, so their usual special interest influence would be watered down.  Please solve this last issue, as your parting gift to the citizens of Florida.  You would not only leave office having fixed one more mess, you will have shown the citizens, and the politicians how the governor can change the tone and direction of debate, to get the people's work done.  This will encourage the legislative branch to do their jobs during the regular session in the future.
 
 
Help us one more time!

Dear Governor Bush:
I feel you have done a real good job as Governor of Florida.
We seniors, need some relief -
I just received my home owners bill, up from $700 to over $1700.
Plus our electric bill has gone thru the roof.
Last bill was $178.72 for 1616 kwh
Last year same period - $158.96 for 1797 kwh
So that means about $250 for the year, plus the $1000 for insurance,
We could only wish that our income would go up that amount so we could
pay the bills without having to choose between
eating and medications.
So, unless the politicians who are running this year make some
kind of promise, and be sincere about it, the votes that you
see for the Disney characters will be mine.
For years I've voted Republican, but neither party
seems to be after the senior vote.

Governor Bush , My wife and I just moved to Florida in June 2005 and we both love it here. I think the state has so much on the ball and is a wonderful place to live. We live in Clearwater and just love the area.

Lately I have been a little upset with all the complaining about property taxes, home owners insurance etc.

I have a few comments/suggestions on some of these and other issues:

1. As far as insurance goes, I don’t have access to all the facts and figures, but I think that raising the hurricane deductible from 2% to 4% and making the same deductible for sinkhole claims along with capping insurance company liability at $1,000,000.00  should result in an approximately 20-25% reduction in insurance premiums. This should reduce most of the nuisance type claims for cosmetic damage as opposed to structural damage.

Home owners with houses valued at over $1,000,000.00 should be able to buy additional coverage at their expense or from a special pool for this amount of coverage. This I believe is similar in effect and concept to a luxury tax

2. Doubling the homestead exemption is a step in the right direction, but I think people need to be reminded that there is no state income tax here, so property taxes will be higher. Try living in Ohio where you have state income tax, city income tax and school district income tax.

3. Political responsibility. Pass a state law that would make politicians convicted of a crime not only criminally responsible, but also financially responsible for their crimes. There is no reason that taxpayers should have to foot the bill for investigating and prosecuting a politician that violated the public trust. If they were morally deficient enough to violate that trust, then they should have to bear the full burden of their acts.

Governor Bush,
 
I am thoroughly disgusted by the lack of action on the part of the Florida government to help its citizens with the terrible increase in insurance costs, and real estate taxes.  My homeowners policy went from $1,500 to $4,372.70. - it more than doubled in one year, and was allowed to happen by this government - the same government that I thought was supposed to be working to help the citizens.   There is also the issue of not being able to sell your home, and buy another because you are then hit with huge increases in the real estate taxes.
 
You apparently believe that you do not need to do anything to provide immediate relief because you can't be re-elected.  No one did anything on this issue - apparently because they just want to play politics and as this is an election year they can use it as an "issue".  I am thoroughly disgusted with you as Governor, the Florida Sentate and House that this was allowed to happen.
 
I am not seeing a government that is concerned for its citizens.  I am demanding immediate action on the above matters - even if special session has to be called to deal with these two matters only.  Action taken should include immediate relief, not something that will happen 1, 2 or 3 years down the road.

Dear Governor Bush:

A remainder to the FLORIDA voters about the republican party and GOVERNOR 
BUSH accomplisments. When you go and vote remember who was the governor 
that prevented a constitutional amendment to double the homestead to 
$50,000.00 It was no other than governor JEFF BUSH. He did it under the 
excuse and using Machiavellian misinformation that doubling the homestead 
exception will no necessarily decrease the real estate tax. While he knew 
full well what the majority of Florida taxpayer wanted he went against the 
will of the people and ran to the court to squash the petition This is 
also the same governor that preferred to remove the alcohol tax than to 
provide tax relief to the Florid home owners. Governor Jeff Bush is also 
the same governor that fought won the cancellation of the Florida BULLET 
TRAIN after it was approved by a constitutional which later was changed 
under lies and misinformation. He's favorite excuse was that we didn't 
have enough money for the project. He is also the same GOVERNOR that 
lobbied and won the removal of the intangible tax which was only affecting 
the Florida very wealthy. 
 
I have one question for my fellow citizns we had once a very strong 
constitutional amendment to double the homestead exception.  We know that 
the governor squashed the will of the Florida voter, why we don't have 
another amendment on the ballot this year. This would have been an 
amendment with a great deal of support. What happened with the past real 
estate tax amendment creators and supporters. Is it possible that they 
were bought or threaten to remain silent. HUH! something here smell bad.
 
You might think I am a democrat but guess what I am a republican but not 
an idiot. My vote will go to the best possible candidate that can 
articulate and promise to provided real estate tax and insurance reform to 
the Florida citizens. In my opinion the homestead exception should be set 
at $100,000.00 The criteria used when it was created dictates to bring it 
at least to the $100,000.00 amount Is an immense abuse political/goverment 
power what is happening with the real estate taxes now been collected 
servicing in most cases the same infrastructure. Meaning we have not had 
to increase police, fire or public service we have the same darn houses 
and buildings generating huge tax revenue at the pain of the Florida 
taxpayer.

Subject:	I support Nemours Children's Hospital for Orlando

Dear Sirs and Madams:

I am writing to voice my support for Nemours Children's Hospital proposed facility in Orlando. Nemours Children's Hospital will bring a highly specialized, pediatric focused, endowed institution to Central Florida.

The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered in this region and establishing a location where medically complex pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one seamless system of care.

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus that will support research, physician and health care worker education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide destination for health care.

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children need, they will receive.

Growth Information:

- Florida?s pediatric population is growing rapidly and 10-15% of the children born in any given year will need specialized pediatric care. Moreover, that percentage is on the rise.
- By 2030, Florida will have the third largest pediatric population in the country (source: U.S. Census Bureau.) Between 2000 and 2030, Florida will gain more than 2 million children. This large and growing population needs access to the specialized services that Nemours will offer.
- The number of children admitted to a hospital in Central Florida grew by 37% in the past five years, from 11,684 admissions to 16,029; however, the number of pediatric hospital beds shrank by 24% during that time, from 328 beds to 249 beds. (source: Health Council of East Central Florida)

Economic Impact Information:

- Nemours has contributed more than $550 million to Central and North Florida since 1980 as evidence of its commitment to the children of Florida.
- There will be no fundraising or community contributions solicited to build this hospital. No tax dollars or government resources are required.
- Nemours has offered a gift to the Central Florida community that includes:
- $250-300 million capital investment in a top-tier children's hospital
- $30-40 million annual mission investment in a children's hospital (double the current mission investment in the existing Nemours Children's Clinic in Orlando)
- 1,500 potential jobs with an economic impact of over $350 million in Central Florida
- Central Florida will have access to the Nemours Biomedical Research Program, ranked 13th in 2004 NIH funding among children?s hospitals.
- Today, there are presently 103 Nemours clinicians and 17 PhD lab heads involved in biomedical research programs. Those numbers would increase with a children?s hospital in Orlando.
- Nemours academicians produce almost 250 peer-reviewed contributions to journals, books and chapters annually. Nemours contributes several million dollars annually to the cost of the programs.

Nemours children's health care system and hospital will serve as the catalyst for a broad-ranging advocacy program aimed at addressing issues affecting the quality of life and health status for children. Nemours will collaborate with other health care providers, community agencies, and related pediatric organizations to further pediatric advocacy.

I sincerely hope that you see all the good that can come to our city with the addition of a facility such as Nemours. Please make your support for a new children's hospital for Orlando known, as well.

Thank you for your time!

Governor Bush, 
I heard on the radio this morning that Florida has the dubious distinction of being the state with the highest rate of foreclosure on single family homes.  I can only think that the dramatic increases seen in Property Taxes has a lot to do with it.  I know there is talk in Tallahassee around increasing the homestead exemption credit and of lowering taxes in general...however I know the speed at which government operates.  I'm a retired Navy Veteran, employed full-time, with my wife working and it looks like I am going to have to look for another job, just to make ends meet.... Is there any relief in the "near" future?  

Best wishes,

October 9, 2006
 
Honorable Governor, 
 
My husband, Frank, and I are appealing to you for wise judgement regarding the current fiasco surrounding property taxes and Snowbirds or property owning non-residents.  Presently, it has become more of a punishment to own property in Florida rather than an honor.
 
As card carrying members of the National Republican Party, we are asking for your help.
 
Please find below, email sent to the following people yesterday regarding this situation.  
 
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Wyman and Ms. Wallman,
 
This is a copy of a letter sent to the Property Tax Reform group as given in your article dated Sunday, October 1, 2006.
 
My husband and I are have a condo in KingsPoint in Tamarac which we visit only a few times a year using the roads and happily spending our money.  The remainder of our time is on Long Island New York where we live and work.
 
Our tax bill of August was a shock and prompted both of us to visit the Broward Tax Office where we spoke to a kind gentleman from the Water Department.  He didnt help us.
 
The condo we own is in a large over 55 community, Kings Point. Many residents are snowbirds/flakes such as us.  Due to the small amount of time spent there, obviously we do not use all the facilities that we pay for in our taxes, as well as the schools.
 
When we complained about our taxes, we were led to believe that not many people had complained and were happy with their lot.  When speaking to individuals, we were told...what can I do except move to the Carolinas.
 
My husband and I wish to be kept up-to-date with the situation and will fight it to the best of our ability.
 
Your article of October 1st was outstanding.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bobbi and Frank Benigno

Sunday, October 8th
 
Dear Committee,
 
Both my husband, Frank, and I are interested in becoming members of the tax reform committee as Snowbirds/Snowflakes from Long Island New York.
 
This past August, we received a tax bill that had increased by 44 percent from the previous year for a condo at KingsPoint in Tamarac.  We went to the government offices in Broward County to protest and spoke to a gentleman who was filling in due to the large number of complaints.  He was from the Water Department and told us to go to all the town meetings in September.  Perhaps that would be do-able if we lived there fulltime or were on an extended vacation.  However, we both work and found it impossible to go to the meetings.
 
I spoke to many residents who were not really interested in the situation as they were on the receiving end of the taxes.
 
Both my husband and I are frustrated with the tax laws in Florida and with the attitude of many politicans, as written in the newspaper.  We feel this is TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.  Tea was thrown overboard in Boston Harbor for less!!!
 
If the taxation continues as it is at the present, we will be paying more taxes in Florida, where we visit a month a year, than on Long Island, where we spend the rest of our time.
 
I researched the tax base of the Broward School System and noted the  many benefits given to the teachers.  That would be acceptable if (1) the school system was outstanding, which it is not and (2) if we had children of school age attenting the schools. Homeowners not having children attenting Florida schools much less not having children of school age, should NOT be forced to pay the bulk of the school tax.
 
I can understand that taxes for highways but not for schools.  The list goes on and on.  However, please be advised that both my husband, Frank, and I would be interested in joining your committee and would be working assets.
 
It is better to be part of a group rather than a lone fighter.  There is strength in numbers.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bobbi and Frank Benigno

 Dear Mr. Bush,
 
      I have been hearing much about how teachers aren't getting paid enough money, and I don't understand why they get such a low salary. My Mom is a Dade County Public School teacher, and I'm always hearing about how we are having financial problems. My Mom and Dad are always talking about how we can't do certain things, like I can't go on many school field trips because we can't afford it. The way I see it, teachers should be payed the most because if it weren't for teachers you and I wouldn't know anything. I wouldn't be sending this e-mail to you if it weren't for teachers. Teachers are the reason society can progress and grow. When my Mom was teaching in Michigan she was paid about triple what she is being payed here! I don't understand why you don't make some room for teachers in the budget. This is an important issue to me so please reply. Thank you for your time.
 
                                   Sincerely,

FLORIDA MAINTAINS 'AAA' BOND RATING IN ANNUAL REVIEW BY STANDARD AND POOR's

On Tuesday, I touted Standard and Poor's Corporation's decision to affirm
Florida's 'AAA' bond rating in its annual review of the state.  'AAA' is the
firm's highest rating.  Standard and Poor's cited Florida's strong,
conservative financial and budget management practices in affirming the
'AAA' rating, first issued in 2005.  Undaunted by eight hurricanes in two
years, Florida's economy is surging. I am pleased to see that Standard and
Poor's has recognized that our low-tax, pro-business approach to government
is working for Florida.  Our reasonable tax structure and record-level
financial reserves have also helped to create stability and opportunities
for long-term growth, as evidenced by this rating decision.  For more

FLORIDA LAUNCHES INAUGURAL SALES TAX HOLIDAY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS

On Thursday, I encouraged Floridians to take advantage of Florida's
inaugural sales tax holiday for energy efficient products. The sales tax
holiday is an important component of the 2006 Florida Energy Act. To promote
energy conservation during Energy Awareness Month, I signed a proclamation
recognizing October 5 - 11, 2006, as Energy Efficient Week. Energy Efficient
Week encourages Floridians to invest in energy efficient products by
providing relief from sales tax for approved products and appliances for up
to $1,500. Qualifying energy efficient products include a dishwasher,
clothes washer, air conditioner, ceiling fan, incandescent or fluorescent
light bulb, dehumidifier, programmable thermostat, or refrigerator that
meets all requirements of the ENERGY STAR program.  For more information on
energy in Florida, visit www.floridaenergy.org.


REMARKS TO 2006 K-12 INNOVATION CONFERENCE

Also on Thursday, I addressed 700 educators attending the 2006 K-12

Florida Education Foundation co-hosted the 2006 K-12 Conference and
Innovation Fair.  The conference focused on innovative approaches to
improving student achievement at the middle and high school levels.  I was

Subject:	Retirement

Mr. Bush,
        I know that your term is about to end and I feel bad that it is. We're going to miss you. I was wondering if there was one last thing you could try to do before you leave. I would like for you to ask congress to allow everyone under the state retirement to be given the opportunity to a full retirement after 25years. I work in the education field and as we all know that it's a very important field. I feel my job is just as important as a police officer or a fireman. I realize their job may be more dangerous than mine but not any more important. As things are now if we retire with 25 yrs. of service and are at an age between 55 to 58 we are penalized 5% per year below the age of 62. That is unfair. I feel the State of Florida should be fair with everyone under their retirement and meets their standards.
 
Thank you for listening and like I said before, we're going to miss you!
 
Good luck in the future,
Steve Hallett

Subject:	[*] NFIP may be the culpret motivating the insurance debacle in FL, induldge me

Dear Honorable Sir, Governor Bush:

Having just finished a project for a 230 acre zoning change from shaded A to unshaded X, I am forced to rely on the Presidential Order initializing a federal OMB Paperwork Reduction Act for enforcement of pay at time costs and expenses spelled out within the OMB #3067-0147 MT-1, LOMA, MT-2, LOMR applications assigned to me.  It was during the accumulation of the support materials  required, that I found a national program within a state regulated infrastructure that was not being state regulated.  The scrutiny of flood insurance policies including the applications with fraudulent information contained there in for our construction dates then reading of 44 CFR 61, 62.  I find the NFIP offered a defaulted number appearing for a line item identified by the words “significant improvement date”  NFIP defaults to 12/31/74.  A building being built  12/31/74 or the date of the first NFIP FIRM map panel are to be listed here.  We are lazy and do not look up panel.  Unfortunately, this date defaults all properties into an “at risk assessment” increased premium and guarantee issue flood policy.   Man is  minimalist so government wins, Florida is paying a 1 + 1/3rd premium increase to NFIP.  This is all well and good until the state becomes involved in insurance and the U.S. Statistical Abstract generates their impact for FL Statistical Abstract number corrections of at risk underwriting.  UF assigns risk management spill over; but, statistical abstracts are unable to differentiate truth from default.  If agents were to follow the statute to the letter of the law upon new mapping, new policy applications, or completion of new datum all new datum would appear to NFIP for underwriting.  

    Agents are to provide in system entry of new datum at new map, new data, new policy application.  “WINK, WINK” if you enter 12/31/74 you don’’t have to do all that.  On our site the production of the two forms known as the Certified Elevation Certificates (2 each site I, and II and 2 Engineer correction error) cost me 24 hours of data entry each pair.  For the two sites it took me 72 hours the Base Flood Elevation datum correction was most significant.  The facts are it would take at least 24 hours in office billable expense for Pine Ridge at Lake Tarpon Village I 

     It appears no agent is willing to do this entry as a project as a mere proposal so it turns into the application and ten years passed our site with two map corrections, three Certified Elevation Certificates produced and 10 new policies.  Where are we to go the state does not regulate NFIP as procedural for error.  Our last 7 years of notice of a need to be removed from flood cost us $495,000.00 the same amount Bilirakis raised in Tampa with our Presidential visit.  Our community is wealthy and could have generated millions but we are lazy and sloppy in our GOP Politics as this Provisionally Accredited Levee effecting our underwriting change has been in existence for 33 years.  We have supported the NFIP in error for 33 years of gross negligence and national insurance non-governed regulation protection costing Billions collectively.  Congressman Bilirakis knew as FLOOD Insurance is a key issue to Tarpon Springs where interconnecting river and bayous hover around mean high tide.  Lake Tarpon Outflow Canal Flood Control Device is USACOE (73) design, SWFWMD managed.  Spring Bayou Epiphany fresh spring source of Lake Tarpon Sink Hole Concrete Gated Control Device at A. L. Anderson Park.  

    You need to read the 44 CFR 61 to 62 requirements to discern a need for policy changes or internal actuating insurance control to meet proper input requirements.  Remove assessed risk by factual underwriting, ask UF.  They used a corrective formula risk correction by Chi square.  This is critical to why CITIZENS was ever needed.  Underwrite by hard facts. Re-assign risk assessments. I have an engineer ready to provide Certified Elevation Certificate production so underwriting can be provided.  

    Send fax number if you require hard copy flood policy information.  Default figures made manifest to me by my involvement in the 230 acre projects.

    

Thanking you in advance for your kind attention to this matter.

  

Sincerely I Remain,

 

Karen Paula Williams 

P.S. You can check with Peter Dunbar to know I am not a crank.  

I spoke to him at a 718 work session forewarning him of his BOCC Client interest i.e. the out flow canal dissemination or non-dissemination f said findings. I was assigned the project of the 230 acre FIRM FEMA zoning change, which is now approved.  And I am awaiting “The Presidential Order” defined time cost burden notice PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OMB #3067-0147 MT-1, MT-2, payment by executive order through counsel John D.

Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush: I am a 78 year old citizen of
Tampa,Fl.  I am a federal retiree.  My income is not sufficeient to keep
up with the cost of living, and, as,  like myself there are thousands in
the same boat, we live moderately but with no extras.  I live in condo
with 104 units, 90% retirees,. Our concerns basically are  alike:
insurance rates going up on real estate taxes and insurance coverage and
how much ??  It seems we all have the same  concern-what  is this going
to do to us?? Are we going to have to sell and move away?? What a pity
if this happens!! Now we are concerned.  I have friends that have moved
to Las Vegas and Phoenix. Their taxes are less than 50% of our taxes due
to the gambling taxes each state collects. My question to you, Governor
Bush, is why do we not legalize gambling in Florida to help all
citizens. We have horse and dog racing and we have a huge gambling
casino in Tampa owned by the Seminoe Indians.  I understand they do not
pay taxes on this income, and that all families members receive
approximately $3,500. each per month.  This is absurd and ridiculous to
say the least !  Why can we not legalize gamblling and  give all
deserving citizens financial asssistance by lowering our taxes.  Why
should the Seminole Indians reap the gambling proceeds from all the
surrounding area?  They don't even pay taxes!!  Is this right??? Why are
they so privileged??  That, sir, makes no sense, whatsoever !  I am
almost certain the public would vote "yes" for casino gambling in
Florida,  Lets take advantage and pass the gain to our deserving
citizens that have paid their share of taxes all their life. Please give
much thought and consideration to establish casino gambling in Florida.
Lets put it on the ballot.  My friends o to Biloxi, Ms., Atlantic City,
NJ., and Las Vegas,Nv., to gamble.  WHY TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF FLORIDA ??
LETS KEEP IT HERE !. Thank you much for reading this important message
and make it your personal crusade to help all Florida citizens.

Subject:	[*] $50,000 homestead exemption

Dear Gov. Bush,
I think property should be taxed on the first $25,000 and then exempt from the next $50,000.  
I picked a street, Mosaic, in my subdivision, Forest Hills, in Holiday, Florida, and discovered that of the 75 homes on that street, not counting the ones that did not qualify for homestead exemption, only 14 had a taxable value over $50,000.  
If the first $50,000 is exempt, it will discourage people from improving their property, thus creating slums.  Also, since 51 of the 75 homes on Mosaic will be below the taxable amount, who will make up the lost revenue?
Even though the new houses in Florida are higher priced, there are still many older homes with lower assessed values.  I think taxing the first $25,000 would be a fairer way.

rocketed and our annual property taxes on this
property went up to $5015 ( a 152% increase). Now we
can’t afford to retire at this location, and because
of these outrageous property taxes we are finding it
very difficult if not impossible to sell this
property.  Even our primary home is going to be
difficult to sell, because of the re-evaluation at the
time of resell.  

It’s really bad when the biggest expense that you have
to plan for and worry about on a limited income, is
State Property Tax…

Hi,

I’ve been watching the weather around the nation, not just Florida and it seems the country is having a terrible few years all over. Is it possible to suggest to legislature to make Home Insurance tax deductible.  With the high cost being deductible it would possibly make Florida a little more appealing to both investors and insurers alike.

 

If this was national then more people on low and fixed incomes may be able to insure their homes and maybe even homes paid for to come back in the market rather than hope for the best.

 

Respectfully,

Subject:	 THE AMERICAN DREAM

Dear Governor and Dear CFO,  
 
I feel compelled to write to you under this title hoping it will catch your eye among the large amount of e-mails I am sure you get everyday.
 
It’s simple. We all want to own a home, the major investment the average citizen will make in a life time, and an assumed security to help put kids through college and perhaps in the long run a reverse mortgage to secure a decent place to live one’s final days…
 
For the past 7 years lending institutions have been pushing home market values up to justify lending money based on equity earned. No one ever considered the actual market and/or assessed values as they appeared in the trim notices year after year…a more expert value appraiser, (licensed by the city or the State, but well paid by those hidden closing costs), appraised homes at a higher value so banks could make huge profits…eventually this led to the infamous real estate “bubble” which, after all the big guys made all their money, it burst, leaving the average American citizen with yet another predicament: Property taxes and insurance no one can afford!
 
If taxes are serious enough so we have to pay for them, taxing authorities should have been serious enough to enforce the actual market and assessed values as stipulated by expert official appraisers year after year in trim notices. And therefore, lending institutions and independent state licensed property appraisers should be prosecuted…or, the taxing authorities should be challenged with either looking the other way, or being part of this process…but authorities make it even worse when they approve an increase on the insurance, which in my case went from a $1,500 premium last year to a $3,844 premium this year!...and it's due in 10 days! I guess it's all right for you guys to have us pay more than twice...Are you passing a law for employers to raise our salaries 160%...Where do I get $2,344?...Oh I know, I shall ask for another line of credit based on the equity of my home, Right?
 
As if this was not bad enough, Broward county has determined my property value has increased 23% in less than 12 months, based on bla, bla, bla, bla which I have nothing to do with…expert licensed appraisers valued the house for a purchase price of $266,000 while the assessed value was at $ 160,000…not my fault, I needed to buy a home, remember? The American dream?  In less than 24 months the city assessment goes from $228,000 to $283,000 for 2006 tax purposes…probably a state licensed property appraiser will estimate the house value at $460,000…Who is correct? Why the speculation? Why is it allowed?
 
The question to you both at this point is whether or not at the end of the day people will be able to afford an additional $500 a month to pay for taxes, on top of flood coverage and dwelling insurance for which an additional $320 will be requireed…or whether to rent instead of own a home while renting communities are asking for an additional $200 minimum to renew rent contracts…and if you add to that the condominium and condominium additional assessments, the actual rent or mortgage will reach amounts no one will be able to afford...
 
This being an election year, you couldn't have picked a worse time to do this to the people who voted for you. But, Do you really care? You won't be running for Governor anyway...
 
Good bye American dream…

What is going to be done about the ridiculous hike in both Insurance and Taxes, you are big on Education, none of our teachers will be able to live in South Florida if these rates keep going the way they are.  My taxes and insurance cost me a $1000.00 a month and that's before I pay my mortgage.  The other problem, people are qualifying for buying homes, but when the loan goes to underwriting and they include the taxes and insurance the people no longer qualify for the loan, causing many people to back out of home purchases.  You obviously know it's a huge problem, something drastic needs to be done and done soon.  People are desperate and increases of insurance over $4000.00 a year is unbelievable.  We cannot sell our homes to live somewhere less expensive, it's a vicous circle, that will hurt the Florida economy!
 
You know I am one of millions dealing with this outrage!

Subject:	[*] insurance and taxes

Governor  Bush, 
     I'm a long time resident  of  Florida .I  live  in  Clearwater , Tampa Bay area.  In the  past  three years my  insurance has more  than  doubled  with  Citizens from $600-$2100. Presently  I  can  not  afford  these  kind  of  payments  and  Citizens is the  only  one  who  will  carry  me.
My  question  to  you is why am I paying these kind of rates ? My  home according to  Pinellas County  is a  Non-evacuation area in the  event  of a  flood  or a hurricane . My  home  is  70feet above  sea level .My  home  has been  in  my family  since  1977,since  then  there  has  never  been a  flood  on  my  street  or in my neighborhood . Actually my former nextdoor neighbor who  purchased  his  home in  1951 had  told me  many a  time  that there  has  never  been flooding  in this  neighborhood . 
           To  add insult  to injury the Insurance  broker  I must use is  in tampa(not  very  convienient).In  addition  to  that the  broker ,Rich  Lovinger Ins. informed  me that  I  need to have  my  home re-inspected since  my policy  lapsed .The  inspectors inspection consist of  me  leaving  a  check in my mailbox for  $75 and  he  sending  a affidavidt of  some sort  to  Rich  Lovinger to  process  my insurance  with  Citizens . However  I  do not  have $2100 to  pay  and  I  am a  single  father taking  care  of  my  son. Now  if  our  wages in  Florida  had  increased  as much  as  our  insurance  premiums I'm sure I  would  not  be  in  this  situation .
        Also , I  was  under the  impression that a  inspection was  also to take  place  inside  the  home,that never  did  happen. A  liittle  more information for you . I have  talked  to several local restaurant  owners , quite a  few  are  going  to   close  their  doors because of  this insurance  fiasco , and many have been  forced  too  in the  last  few  months . Clearwater  is a  tourist  town , at  this  rate  there  wil be  no  tourisim or  residents . Many   of  my  friends  and  co-workers are  chosing  not  to  have  insurance  or  cant  afford  it . 
       My  question  to  you Mr. Bush  and  to Dennis  Jones is  do you have  any intentions  of  trying  to  rectify this  situation . Many of  us  are on  fixed incomes  are  single  parents  and we do not  qualify  for  any  kind  of  assistance .Do  we  wait   for a  possible  tragedy  to  hit us ? Fire ? Hurricane ? Tornado? and  then apply  for  federal  aid  of  some  kind  ?  Or  is  just that the  Florida  legislators pockets  are  full of  donations  from  insurance  companies ? Waiting  for your  reply.
                                                                       Paul Michniewicz

To whom it may concern,

 

 

Our taxes have become a real mess. Homestead that was going to help has instead caused a great injustice to many. I did not realize how bad things were out of control until I started going to the tax meetings with the cities and our county people. The stories I’m hearing are shocking at best. To hear business people talk about having to close their business due to taxes is just un-American. To see homeowners telling us they can not afford the taxes and may need to sale their properties and leave the state to survive or not be able to qualify to buy a home due to the taxes is unthinkable. What happen to our American Dream? To hear the Mayor of Daytona Beach Shores tell people he did not care about their American Dream, If they can not afford taxes in Daytona Beach Shores, buy in Pelican Bay. What has happen to our elected official being responsible to the public. 

 

Some of the responsible elected officials of Volusia County have heard our pain and have taken action. The have taken the first step’s by cutting the tax increases some all the way back to a full rollback. This is a start but it has not solved the problem. Some say that increasing the Homestead to $50,000 would help. They mean well but they do not understand the problem. 

 

Our State is facing a crisis and decisive action needs to be taken immediately. Although I do not pretend to know the answers, I do have Ideas. I hope our state officials can see that they need to take the time to listen to the public and find out what the problems are. Sometimes us common working public can come up with some good ideas. We must do it for our homes. Maybe it is time for the people in charge to look at the issues with the common since the public has. 

 

The Volusia tax reform people have said they would entertain the idea of meeting with you and inviting the public. I would like to see this happen. If you can not get a hold of them, please call me and I’ll be happy to put you two together.

Subject:	Nemours

Dear Sir:

As a mother and a respiratory therapist, I have a concern regarding the
state of the Nemours hospital in Orlando.  I was employed in the Detroit
area for almost 20 years before moving to Orlando.  The large metro area
reaped the benefits of a world class Medical Center.  I then spent nine
years working for one of the hospital systems that is using it's political
clout to block the Dupont foundation from servicing our area's children.  I
have personally seen the games that are played with our public's trust.  We
need to have a hospital that caters to our children, one of the largest
population groups growing in central Florida.  I have first hand knowledge
of patients that lost battles with disease because of the limited scope of
practices within the Florida Hospital and ORHS systems.

These hospitals fear competition.  As a registered respiratory therapist, I
fail to see what is wrong with a little competition.  Is it not competition
that makes others strive for higher standards?  Comments about shortages of
medical staff can be true.  When I moved here, I took a large cut in pay.
The lack of competition in this area contributes to wage ceilings.  The
competition can only better the standard of living for those of us that are
paying the higher cost of living of Florida while we try to make ends meet
with the compensation standards of many years ago.  Central Florida's
housing and insurance rates have risen higher than all hospital employee's
wages.


For the sake of our children and to bring down more medical professionals,
please give Orlando a Nemours hospital that creates not only jobs, but the
backing of specialists around the country.

Thank you,

Lori Weinzierl, RRT

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus that will support research, physician and health care worker education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide destination for health care. 

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children need, they will receive.

Governor Bush – Would it not be possible to eliminate the Florida State Sales Tax on all items that insurance companies define as “hardening one’s home” in order to make it economically easier for Florida residents to stiffen their homes against the damages of a hurricane? With the ever-increasing premiums for insurance, that would be a gesture that would go to the hearts of the Florida public and lessen the need for FEMA-type funding to repair the damage after a storm.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to you to express my concern and dismay regarding my recent notice about my property taxes.
 
My wife, daughter and I moved here in June of 2005 from Salisbury, MD. We had been dreaming for many years to make Florida our home. So when I was offered a transfer with my company, I gladly accepted. 
 
I came here in February of 2005 and my wife and daughter remained in Maryland to sell our home and for our daughter to complete the 6th grade. My new job took up most of my time, therefore I did not have much of an opportunity to research the area, but because my company decided to open their new facility here in Coconut Creek, we decided this would be a good place to reside.
 
We were shown many, many homes by a local realtor and finally purchased our home. We were totally "sticker shocked", but because we so much wanted to live here, we proceeded to realize our dream. We purchased our home for $350,000. Taxes on this home were a whopping $3,854.55. We were told that this years tax would increase but, by no more that 10-15%. Well imagine our surprise when we received the notice stating that our taxes would now be $5,837.78! This equates to a 50% increase. Furthermore, my electric bill last September was $221.18, this year $325.28 for the same amount of usage and number of days. Our home owners insurance is over $3,000 per year and we have been told to expect at least a 50% increase next year. I don’t even want to go into my automobile insurance.
 
Our dream has turned into a nightmare. We live in a beautiful area with many things to do, but we cannot afford to do any of them. How are we supposed to survive? My salary did not increase with my move. I am 62 years old and at this rate I do not expect to be able to retire until I am in my 70's, God willing. We have seriously considered moving, but we couldn’t even get back the money we put into our house now because the market has crashed and people are not going to purchase a home with these kind of taxes. There are many homes in our neighborhood that have been on the market for close to year, with no interested buyers.
 
What are we supposed to do? We have cut-back on everything, started taking from our limited savings account, but I am afraid that we will lose everything we own. I have contacted the Broward County Property Appraisers office, went to public hearings, and was told we just have to deal with it, this is how Florida is. After listening to others at the last public hearing, I know I am not alone, but that doesn’t make it any easier. If we had known how much it was going to cost to live here we never would have given up our 2500 sq. foot home, in-ground pool, one acre of property with $1900 in taxes, $100 per month electric bills and $300 per year homeowners insurance in Maryland.
 
I realize that your term in office will be up very shortly, and that this letter will have very little, if any, impact.  I also doubt that this letter will be personally read by you, but I felt that I would be remiss if I did not express my thoughts and concerns at this time.

Sir,
I have concerns with the rising prices of Home Insurance, Gas Prices, Electricity, Taxes and others. They have increased quite a bit, more so than our income.
I am a Law Enforcement Officer for Bradenton, My wife works for Manatee County Clerk of Court. I have two children 13 and 14 yoa. If you were to look our wages for this area are lower than comparable areas. I know what your thinking I can choose to go else where to work. I chose to keep my family rooted and stable.
This is going to be difficult. I've done some fast math, it is going to be approx. $4500.00 with all the increases added over the year.
I've been shopping for insurance and have been told that Manatee county and surrounding counties have been targeted, in red, by your office as a threat to hurricane tracks. No Insurance agency is writing this area and they have been referring us to Citizens Insurance. They are expensive. 
Sir, I voted for you, your brother and your father and think that all of you have done a good job. I know this is a battle for you but please do the best you can.
I guess it all comes down to this. It is frustrating when I go over our budget and bills and try to project cars, college, vacation....etc.
On top of this our department is going through contract negotiations. We do not have any teeth to fight with and get no respect, pardon the pun.
I have always managed my money well and live within my means. I now seriously see myself having to work a second job. 
I guess I needed to vent my frusration, if you could point me to a good insurance carrier, keep taxes down( keep doing a good job) or call our Mayor and tell him to give us a BIG raise. Just kidding!
Any constructive advise would be nice.
Thanks....Tim Smith

Subject:	Property Taxes (& Homeowners Insurance)

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

I live in Palm Beach County, where the average cost of a home has gone through the roof (no pun intended), and property taxes along with homeowners/property insurance have become a nightmare.

 

The state legislature needs to step in A.S.A.P.,  to limit the increase in property taxes that counties are allowed to collect for primary residences.  Then, in cases where there has been a near doubling of property taxes, the state should be retroactive. There is no way any county should be allowed to garnish excessive funds  - via property taxes -  simply because housing prices have risen as they have.  There must be a mandate to protect the citizens from unfair taxes such as these. 

 

My taxes for instance, have doubled from about $4000, to this year’s $8000 proposed amount.  The county has no rational to make this the “new amount”,  other than using the old standard rules and formulas from years ago. These formulas must be replaced. People should not continue to be taxed in this way: our state government officials must step in to protect the citizens. 

 

Property /homeowners’ insurance is another huge burden for people living in Florida (again, stating the obvious). Florida’s citizens must see solid evidence that our representatives are making these issues a top priority.  

 

In closing, I am certain that you take seriously  what we are up against. I hope and pray, as all Floridians do, that you will quickly initiate ways to ease the burden of these unfair taxation and insurance issues. 

 

Sincerely,

Kay Ralston

Subject:	Help . . .

Mr. Jeb Bush, please don’t just talk about Property Tax and Insurance Reform, get the committees to resolve these crazy property value adjustments immediately and moving on the Insurance Reform before it is too late.  Time is NOT on our side.  November taxes are due.  Damage to our people and States economy happens everyday.

 

I am a very small Broward business owner in my thirties with 3 rental properties (a duplex and 2 houses) that used to just get by in the black by maybe a $100 each property.   In the last few years, I looked to the appreciation for justification, but now with the median property values decreasing and the future of the real estate market questionable it is not easy to justify ownership.  It has gotten so bad that had to take out loans to pay for the monthly/annual losses.  My taxes have increased on my rentals from13%, 58% to 61% just in the last year.

 

Now this year, I’m (We’re) in big trouble between taxes and insurance issues.  I’m still paying for Wilma damages.  I cannot keep my rents down, and it’s terribly hard to increase them to cover my new expenses, plus get responsible tenants to be able to pay what the rents need to be is nearly impossible.  I have two tenants moving out (one back to Pennsylvania) and two tenants that are late every month trying to scrape up the increased rent amounts.  As a landlord, it is IMPOSSIBLE to provide affordable housing for the “blue collar and middle class.”

 

I also own a few vacant lots (again I am a business owner) that I bought for my future financial security so I don’t have to work until I die, but now the taxes have gone up from 11%, 25%, 32%, 68% to 376%.  How can the state government allow these increases without expecting it to hurt millions?

 

In addition to my problems the Tax and Insurance issue is negatively affecting EVERYONE, and the ramifications will not be entirely realized for a few years.  Here are a few examples, but there are many, similar and additional situations that I ‘m sure you are aware of:  

 

My parents, retired on a set income can no longer pay all of there bills without putting a reverse mortgage on there home that they bought in Royal Palm Beach to be closer to me.  They can’t believe that they sold there home in New York because of taxes, and there taxes are more now then they would be paying if they stayed there.  It’s not right that people have to be put into this situation.  They worked their whole lives to retire in Florida and enjoy lives with their families.

 

My neighbors, Canadian Snow Birds tax bill doubled from $12K to 23K, and are looking at property elsewhere, so they can sell.  And these people have money (real money), and during the 6 months they live here they spend a lot of it on everything from $100K cars to local shopping and restaurants every other night.  They have company almost every week, all of which spend money in our local economy.  Once more snow birds get fed up and move out, our economy is going to really get hurt.  Not only will this affect the real estate market, but it will have devastating results to our local businesses, and residents who sometimes our “Homesteaded Owners” don’t realize.

 

I am active in the Broward Real Estate Investors Association (BREIA), and the Florida Landlord Action Group (FLAG), and I may not speak for the entire groups behave, but I know that with thousands of members strong we are concerned that these two issues will hurt us all more than what Wilma and the more active Hurricane seasons. 

 

To reiterate, who everyone is:  Small Business Owners, Large Business Owners, Blue Collar Workers, White Collar Workers, Landlords, Tenants, Real Estate Investors, Florida Natives, Homesteaded, Non-Homesteaded Property Owners, Snow Birds, Tourism, Retired, Foreign Investors and many others.

 

Please help today.  Regardless of whether you’ll be in office in the future or not, please get someone competent to resolve these issues today.  Taxes are due in November.  

 

Again, please help this state from its own demise!

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Subject:	Property Taxes

Mr. Governor
 
I would like to know if there is anything that you can do or plan to do regarding Florida's property taxes prior to leaving office.  There are two areas that I feel need to be addressed.
  
The first being the fact that there is no limitation on the amount of increase on the assessed value of a second home or investment property which will significantly increase the amount of taxes paid.  For the second home, this deters what we call the snowbirds and or frequent visitors to own, which contribute to our economy.  For the investor, it creates an increase in what is required to charge for rent which increases costs for all of the individuals who must rent in Florida.  Please do something to limit the amount of increase on the assessed value to help for this not to become a major issue.

The second is for us individuals who own our home and are paying basically a second mortgage when it comes to the amount of property tax we are paying.  We will pay for our house a second time just in property taxes, for the right to own our home.  It would also help if there was some form of credit if we chose to move to another home.  We had considered downsizing to a smaller home in a better area for our children and have found that we would actually be paying 50% or more of an increase in property tax.  Please do something to help us in this area. 

It would also be nice to know where all of this extra money is going because we hear of budget problems and cuts.  This is ridiculous based on the increase of revenue from the property taxes alone.  Please share with us your opinion, views and intentions, if any, on this subject.

Best regards,
Anthony Pike

Attn:  Policy - Karen Halperin

 

Thank you for answering all seven (7) questions below.  I am satisfied and will vote for Charlie Crist.  

 

WE HAVE A CONTRACT - Charlie Crist and Leonard Bauduin, effective this date

 

However, I do hope that the Governor can evaluate/consider two of my suggestions when he has time:

 

1.  A possible solution to keep property tax down could be an increase in the sales tax.  This would mean help from the tourists that visit this state.  Our tax dollars certainly keeps things nice for tourists, they use the assets, so the property owners should not take the entire burden.

 

2.  I beleive the home insurance laws for Florida should be changed.  Property owners should not be required to have $100,000 coverage for personal property if they only have $10,000 worth of personal property.   I also suggest very large optional deductibles ($10,000 for each $100,000 of property value) be made law for insurance companies to offer. This would allow the flexibility homeownes need to afford property insurance.  This means an improved housing market and stimulation to the economy.  Most homeowners have enough equity in their home to cover these deductibles.

 

 

.  

                                      ORIGINAL  CONTRACT/QUESTIONS BELOW

 

I will vote for you IF the following questions are answered to my satisfaction.  Failure to answer these questions will result in my vote for your opponent.  Please answer in good faith, be honest, because this will be our contract.  Unfortunately, I have been voting for the least of the two evils, I do hope that this will change.

 

Please answer the following seven questions (my comments and suggestions are below):

 

1.      How do you plan on solving the present Florida Property Tax problem? 

 

2.      How do you plan on solving the present Florida Property Insurance Increases?

 

3.      How do you plan on solving the present rising costs for Health Care?

 

4.      What is your stand on the Illegal Alien Situation?

 

5.      What are your comments on how FEMA reacted on resent hurricane situations and how would you improve this situation?

 

6.      What is your stand on the surging energy cost, starting with GAS prices?

 

7.      Do you support the conflict in Iraq to suppress terrorists?

This PCOC fiasco is an embarrassment to Polk County and to Florida.  In light of the latest indiscretion of the agency, the illegal secret taping of federal investigators, I am amazed that this corrupt agency is still in existence.  Will you please do something to just make it go away and end this insanity?

Subject: The State Charter

Dear Sir; The State Charter that allows a developer, to develop the property and pass the ballooned cost on the residence in the form of a bond dept assessment should be ether appealed or amended.    Here in the Villages we have no say in ether the spending, the purchasing, the politics of our community with the States charter approval.  The villages has an appointed board of directors, we also had an appointed board of district supervisors that sold us out, we pay a bond with 6% inter. charge added to our taxes,  you see most of us were never inform of a bond until we closed. 
 
I think it stinks that a developer can appoint a board that, 1- (we must pay their salaries)  this board should step down and we the residence should be allowed to elect our own board.      If this not to there  liking then atlases 3 elected member should sit on the board of directors To oversee  the biding and spending, The villages are now in the hole by millions.   The amenities do not cover the interior Roads, the cart lanes and sink holes  and COUNTY ROAD maintenance, please tell me why the residence are paying taxes to Marion County for the repair and maintenance of our Rds.    
 
I think at sales and again at contract the purchasers should have been informed of 1- if a bond exists, the price of the bond, the % rate of the bond,  I also think the bond should not even exist, it should be added to the cost of the home or as a doing business expense.     2 - A developer should not have the right to appoint a controlling board of directors.   3- If a developer wants 60% control then he should pay 60% of the costs including salary's.  I also think  the board should have the right to negotiate a fair purchase price on common areas.    
 
 As a purchaser in This State, I should have the right to a fare purchase price to my home, any disclosures should be up front, estimated taxes for 3 years. my amenity, water and sewerage fees 
I should be informed of the County that the property is in. 
 
 Do you also know that our board approved the hook up of the water and sewerage to a privet developer out side the village property.   I Amy sorry but I think its time the State Appeal charter 190 witch gives a developer cart blanch.    Thank you.

Dear Mr. Bush, 
I would like to add my disapproval for the Nemours Hospital in Orlando. For many years we have had relied on Arnold Palmer Hospital. This hospital is respected by many in the medical community as well as the millions of people that it helps daily. To add another hospital, essentially offering the same services is ludicrous. What makes more sense is to put the Nemours Hospital in an area where a children's hospital is needed. 
Please reconsider your support of Nemours in the Orlando area and help to place this hospital where it will serve more people, not just the same ones split up between two different buildings.
 
Respectfully,

Subject:	Tax Burden on our Snowbirds

Dear Governor Bush: 

I was very concerned to read in Sunday's Sun Sentinel about the plight of our snowbirds having to bear the tax burden (and insurance burden too) because they can't take advantage of the save our home limits which we as primary homeowners enjoy.  I had written the head of the Florida Bankers Association back in the spring to raise my concerns of how all of this will greatly impact the real estate industry in Florida if this and the excess home insurance premium issues aren't addressed and some equitable alternative is put in place. As you know, we have depended on tourism and the second home owners for many many years, and I'm afraid these inconsiderations are going to make our visitors go elsewhere. With all of the excess millions in tax dollars that Florida has received, it seems that a lowering of the tax bills should be possible. 
Why can't there be a save our home legislation for our second home owners? Perhaps not 3% - but what about 5% or 6%? The impact to our economy here in Florida will be devastated if our snowbirds go elsewhere - from the restaurants and entertainment venues, to the real estate industry - homebuilders, construction workers, realtors, bankers etc. etc.
We have a crisis here - not only in over taxation, but also in the outrageous price of homeowners insurance - for primary residences, as well as second home owners. 
Please give this some thought! I know you recognize the impact this can have on our economy! I hope you will support legislation - and should Charlie Crist become Governor, I hope he can implement change. 
Regards, 
Marti Bowman

Dear Governor Bush: As a lifetime Republican Party supporter, I want you to know that the oppressive property taxes in Palm Beach County are going to force me to leave this State. How did our leadership allow this to happen? People have become a prisoner to their home, unable to move up or down in housing as their needs change. Didn't you see this coming during your tenure as Governor? The portable homestead doesn't do it. Taxes must be equalized so everyone pays a fair share. Is it fair that two neighbors with the same basic house pay vastly different tax amounts simply because they purchased at different times? Our Republican leadership has failed me and I question weather I will be able to continue to support the party in the future. I won't even attempt to mention my position on insurance or Mark Foley (and the fact the Party was aware that he was a pervert). Sincerely Yours, Douglas A. Peters

October 2, 2006
 
 
Dear Mr. Governor,
 
 
As a suggestion from the mayor of Pembroke Pines, Frank Ortiz, I am writing to you regarding the issues of home insurance and taxes. I know the mayor and others have written about these issues. Mayor Ortiz said that you have not responded to his letter. But I decided to put my two cents hoping for a positive outcome. 
 
It is needless to say that these issues are making a devastating effect in our home economy. As a homeowner I pay more for insurance and taxes as for mortgage. Unfortunately, seems that there is no political will to address theses issues. All the politicians come up is “there is nothing we can do…” or “we know about these issues but…”
 
We know that the devastating effects of the last hurricane seasons placed a dent into the insurance companies in our state. Now that we are entering the election campaign politicians are saying, they will confront the insurance companies and fix this problem. The problem is on how they will confront them and what the outcome will be. 
 
I personally don’t believe we can do much unless the federal government gets involved and a subsidized insurance program like the flood takes effect. This could have been done during your tenure, but if you still want to leave a positive legacy this is something for which you’ll always be remembered. So, please get the legislature together and at least place the foundation to start the process. Hopefully in the next two years, before your brother’s term is over, we may see something positive.
 
For property taxes positive action can be done now, if there is political will. In this election year politicians are saying they will double the homestead exemption but that amount is not enough. The homestead exemption was created for a homeowner to not pay taxes for his primary residence. But $25,000, in now days, is not helping much. Doubling that will help but is still not enough. The exemption needs to be at least three times of what it is now, up to $100,000, to make a difference. Here you and the politicians in Tallahassee can do something about. If the homestead exemption can be set to at least one hundred thousands dollars, a homeowners that now pays $2,500 could pay $500 instead and use this difference to offset the cost of homeowner’s insurance.
 
I am so disappointed with the political will in Florida that if there is no action on any of these issues before election’s day I’ll vote against the incumbent no matter from which party they come from. My next step will be, as many Floridians have done, to leave the state. 
 
We can not see a future, short or long term, in this state if our homeowner’s insurance and property taxes continue on the rise.
 
 
Bets regards,

Dear Governor Bush,
We have had dialogue in the past. The last time I was in front of you was Nov. 2004 in Mayor Peytons office when you were signing a Faith Based  Executive Order.  I've been asked by an A+ Rated Fortune 50 Insurance Company to bring to market a program called "Structured Sales".  In a nut shell a Structured Sale allows purchasers of land to buy at dicounted amounts and sellers to tax manage thier capital gains while netting more out of the sale.  I've sent a letter to Sue Mullins, of the Nature Conservancy, people like Ken Reecy, Eva Armstrong should be aware of this option.  Please advise me who I should contact to inform and educate regarding this ally to Florida's land acquisition/conservation goals. Or, as in the past, I'd look forward to your office contacting me!  Meanwhile I am assiting the Army National Guard Chaplain Glenn Finch to recruit Chaplains for the Armed Forces.

FAMILY DAY HOSTED AT THE CAPITOL

On Monday, First Lady Columba Bush, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings, and Florida
Office of Drug Control Director Bill Janes and I hosted "Family Day" at the
Capitol to encourage families to spend time together. The celebration
demonstrates how simple activities, such as eating dinner together as a
family, can open the lines of communication, strengthen families and
increase the likelihood children will remain drug-free.  Taking an active
role in our children's lives is the single best way to prevent drug use.
Regular conversations and open dialogues are easy ways for parents to learn
more about their children, get to know their friends and help them with the
challenges of growing up in today's world.  "Family Day - A Day to Eat
Dinner With Your Children" is part of a national campaign led by President
George W. Bush and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at
Columbia University (CASA). Families are encouraged to talk to their
children about avoiding the dangers of substance abuse, underage drinking
and smoking. Florida was the first state to adopt the "Family Day" program
in 2001 when President Bush proclaimed it as "a day to spend quality time
with family members and engage in other wholesome activities that help unite
and strengthen the bonds between parents and children".   For more
information on "Family Day", please visit www.floridafamilyday.com.


TORREY PINES WELCOMED TO FLORIDA

On Tuesday, I joined Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies Founder

a host of industry, state and community leaders to officially announce the
Institute's plans to establish a Florida headquarters in the master-planned
community of Tradition in St. Lucie County.  The Institute will spur the
creation of many new, high-wage jobs on the Treasure Coast in its pursuit of
significant biomedical research.  The decision by Torrey Pines Institute for
Molecular Studies to expand into Florida further establishes our state as a
hub for advanced biomedical research and commercialization.  This move will
have a significant impact on the local economy while continuing to build
upon a growing life sciences sector in Florida.  I congratulate St. Lucie
and the entire Treasure Coast region for their aggressive and successful
recruitment of Torrey Pines.  I wish Torrey Pines great success in Florida.

Aloud Simultaneously in Multiple Locations".  The event, Breaking a World
Record: Reading Aloud!, aimed to bolster reading among middle school
students.  The record attempt was aired via a live public broadcast and
Webcast from Disney-MGM Studios.  Promptly at 11:25 a.m., I led the students
in reading an excerpt from the book "Peter and the Starcatchers" written by
Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson.  According to Guinness World Records(tm), the
current record is 155,528 students from 737 schools throughout the United
Kingdom who read William Wordsworth's poem "Daffodils", on March 19, 2004.
Jane Feber, an eighth grade teacher from Mandarin Middle School in Duval
County, came up with the idea of breaking the record and shared it with me.
In the coming months, the state will receive confirmation from Guinness as
to whether or not the attempt was successful. To view the Webcast of the
event, please visit www.JustReadFlorida.com.

Please allow Nemours to bring their state of the art facility to the Orlando area.   I work at an elementary school and see some of the need of the children.  If Nemours was allowed to bring their weight to Central Florida, some of the unmet needs of children would be satisfied.  Please do not allow politics to interfere with such a great endeavor.  Please allow this great organization to have a place in our community.

Dear Governer Bush,

  I am a full time resident of Pompano Beach Florida. I am writing to you on
behalf of friends here, and colleagues in the northeast. I'm sure your aware
of the crisis we have in Florida with regard to property values,
taxes,insurance and negative press locally here from the Sun Sentinel. The
botom line......people are leaving Florida, not coming. In fact I am 55 and
all my friends in New York are looking elswhere to retire. Florida is funded
by retirees and tourism. We do not have a corporate incentive plan for major
corporation to locate here. Its too expensive. Broward County school
enrollment was down this year for the first time in many years. It doesn't
take a genius to figure out the outcome. If Florida does not put its best
foot forward to attract boomers, business and families it will become a
VAPID Wasteland. Would you come here after you retire? Could you afford to
leave on a pension or fixed income while property taxes, insurance and
hurricanes are a constant threat. Most people can't. I can tell you I am in
the hospitaliy industry. I'm a corprate event planner. Meeting planners are
not booking space now during our "hurricane season". It was previously know
as rainy season. Thanks to all the local bad press that spreads north it has
put a large dent in the industry. Again, plainly put, people in my age group
don't really dream of retiring in Florida, that was our parents dream. We
can, and will go anywhere where our money will last, and have a quality
life. Florida is not the only place in the world with sun!

If you are planning a future run for president. Pull a rabbit out of your
hat and do something to save the day, Florida and and future votes. Please
consult with whoever is our new governor and make this the number one
priority.
Thank you.

Sirs,

I wish to encourage each of you to support bringing the Nemours Childern's Hospital to Orlando.
Not only will it be a world-class facility for the treatment of sick children unlike any other in
the region, but it will bring needed high skilled, high paying jobs to the Central Florida area.
Guys this is a no-brainer. 

Hero, is what they call a person that comes to the aid of a sick child. I don't know what they
call a person that refuses to aid a sick child, but I do know that person does not get voted for.

Jeb,
I understand you are almost at the end of a great 8 years in office.
Any objective observer has to give you the highest marks of any FL governor in recent memory for the job you've done.
But there is one more thing you can do - if only to get the procedure rolling to replace the incredible burden of a fundamentally flawed and counterproductive property tax system that is nothing less than an unjustifiable burden borne by property owners throughout the state.  The current system is nothing less than a license to steal and an abuse of the government's taxing powers.
Howard Troxler, whom I'm sure you know of, is one SPTimes columnist who is not afraid to take a position on principle that is contrary to the editorial gang that runs the paper.
I've printed his column from today's edition below.
After you read his column there can be no way to deny this problem has become the vehicle that could really begin to destroy what you have fought so hard to create during your 8 years.
Please help everyone in the state and guarantee the continued success of the outstanding accomplishments you have achieved.

The way we tax land snuffs out mom & pop

By HOWARD TROXLER, Times Columnist
Published October 1, 2006

  _____  


Ann Hartwig thought a quilting shop would be perfect for the little building she owns on Beach Boulevard in Gulfport. The pleasant, open street leads to the waterfront and is the scene of regular "art walks" for folks to come and stroll.

Hartwig's store is named StarGazer Quilting. She has fabrics, supplies, classes and gifts. "What I've done is charming and cute and appropriate," she says proudly.

Here is what is not cute and charming: her tax bill. 

Last year, her property taxes were $3,762.

This year, they will be between $6,900 and $7,100, depending on how early she pays them to get the discount.

The appraisal of her building, a former single-family home, went from $172,700 last year to $355,200.

"This," Hartwig told me sarcastically, "is the American dream."

As we talked, Theresa Frohne and her daughter Simone listened and nodded. For the past 32 years their family has owned La Cote Basque, a country-French restaurant one block down Beach Boulevard.

Theresa got the restaurant's property tax bill a few weeks ago. "Oh, my God, Simone," she cried out to her daughter as she read it. "They've finished me."

Simone handed me a handwritten sheet with the restaurant's tax history:

$2,604.64 2001

$2,948.14 2002

$3,747.76 2003

$4,303.28 2004

$5,332.77 2005

$10,894.42 2006

The value of the restaurant property, according to the county appraiser's office, went from $255,000 last year to $510,000 this year.

"I can't exist like this," Theresa Frohne said. Simone began to cry as she talked about her late father, Ernest, who started the restaurant with her mother.

So, this is Florida's tax policy.

Yes, we have protected homeowners with the "Save Our Homes" amendment. Homeowners' valuations can't go up more than 3 percent a year.

But that's not true for small-business owners like Hartwig and the Frohne family, or owners of any nonhomestead property. Their taxes are rising a lot faster:

The real estate market in Florida has been red hot, driving up everybody's property value.

Our law in Florida - as in lots of places - says that property must be taxed according to its "highest and best use," and not its existing use.

Hartwig has a bitter but clear understanding of what this means. It means Florida's tax policy is pushing her to sell so that her land can be used for something "better."

We talk about "good planning" and "quality of life" and "community character." But beneath it all, our tax policy pushes out the quilt shops and family restaurants in favor of condos and denser, moneymaking uses.

Hartwig doesn't want to sell. "I thought this was the perfect fit for our little arts district," she said. But in dealing with the government, she said, "I feel like I'm the only one with a sense of responsibility for this neighborhood."

I talked with Jim Smith, the Pinellas property appraiser, and he was sympathetic. He owns a building in Clearwater that he rented to artists. When his building got socked with a 25 percent increase, his appraisers told him maybe he should be renting to doctors or lawyers instead - economically, a "higher" and "better" use.

Smith is frustrated. His office is only obeying the state law on how property is valued, but gets blamed for higher taxes when local governments don't cut their tax rates as fast as land values are growing. He got booed at a public event the other night.

"We need to do something to keep businesses from being valued out of their property," Smith said. "The question is, how do we help small-business people out. By God, we should."

We could create a small-business version of "Save Our Homes," with major consequences for local government.

We could assess property a different way to consider existing use, but that would require changes at the state level, and there would be other side effects and injustices.

"We have to come up with something that makes sense," Smith said. "And I don't know what that is."

I feel this is a strong duplication of services. Orlando Regional  Medical Center  is doing a great job providing ALL  services to the Pediatric Community. This would dilute both hospitals which would be detrimental to both facilities. Let Nemours be a major sponsor to ORMC with research.

Dear Mr. Bush----I retired from the Federal government in Washington, DC almost three years ago and came to Sanibel, Florida.  I had purchased my house in 1998.   I love Sanibel, but I don't know if I will be able to afford to stay here.  Several of my friends have left or they're leaving.  Taxes, due to the increase in property values and insurance costs are to blame.  My wind insurance was through Citizens at a cost of $1,800 per year.  The policy was sold to Florida Peninsula and my new premium went to $5,700!  I had to reduce my coverage to the lowest possible to get it down to $4,400!  I had no damage from any of the hurricanes.  I'm told that I must stay with this insurer for 3 years!  This doesn't even sound legal!  How can this be?????  If I move to another area where the wind rates are less, then I must pay higher taxes because of the value of any new property and lose my homestead where I am!  People have started to leave Florida----and I see why they're going!  Friends of mine that lived on Sanibel for 30 years moved to Panama.  Other friends moved to Mexico!  The change in the makeup of Florida will kill the economy!  Then there's the water issue----with all that dirty water coming down from Lake O-----the water here used to beautiful.  Years ago when I first visited here it was wonderful.  Now visitors are saying they won't come back here----the water is murky and the fish are dead on the beaches!  I know you won't be in office much longer, but someone has to do something about all this!  It's such a shame.  Florida is going down the drain!

Gov Bush,

 

Here is a copy of a letter I sent to the property appraiser of Bay County.  I know you are a proponent of keeping property taxes down but this increase will tax me out of my retirement home.  I just want you to know I think the system is broken if a property tax can be raised in excess of 72% for one year regardless of the homestead tax exemption.  Thank you for listening.

Dear Rick Barnett,

 

I just opened my notice for 2006 real estate property and noticed the condo that I own was assessed from a value of $367,001 to $641,001 which raised the taxes from $5462.27 to potentially $9403.49.  While I don’t argue that the condo could be potentially sold at the assessed value, I do take exception to the over 72% INCREASE IN MY TAX BILL OVER ONE YEAR!  I bought the condo a few years ago and plan on using it to retire in 15 years since I was stationed at Tyndall AFB, FL and am fond of the Bay County area.  I am not allowed to take a homestead exception on the property since I am in the military and am stationed in Jacksonville.  The bottom line is that if you raise my property tax over 72%, you will tax me out of my condo and future retirement home.  You mention that you do not set tax rates but I submit if a tax bill increases over 72% in one year, the system is broken! I cannot afford a $9,400 ($800 per month) tax bill and such an increase in one year.  

 

A copy of this letter is also being sent to Gov. Bush’s office as an example of how the tax codes have gotten out of control.

 

 

Sincerely,

Hi
 
I generally do not complain about paying taxes whether they are State,Federal or Town because I know it costs money to run this state and provide the services we all need, but this is just gone to far. I just received my proposed tax bill for the coming year for my house in Ponce Inlet (Volusia County) and would like to know when this madness is going to stop. I purchased my home in Ponce Inlet in 2001 with a plan to retire there in 2008 but will no longer realize that dream. I will be unable to pay may taxes without going back to work fulltime. In the last 5 years my property tax bill has gone from $1800.00 in 2001 to a proposed tax this year of $72047.29. This is not right, this is highway robbery.What are you people trying to do? My next door neighbor who is retired and has lived in his home for the last 15 years is paying $1200.00 per year and has a larger house.  Granted he is under the homestead rule, I am all for a tax brake for the permanent resident but this spread between our two homes is way out of line. I am being penalized because I cannot move in yet, and I use far less town services.
Retirees will no longer be able to afford this county or town due to this outrageous tax rate. Not only does this tax rate prevent retirees from living here but we will be unable to sell our homes because of the tax rate. I am very saddened by this sate of affairs, I have been looking forward to moving to Ponce Inlet for many years and will no longer have that chance.
Thanks, I realize nothing I say will change anything but I needed to vent. My home will soon be on the market for sale and if I can sell it I will try to find another location in Florida that is a little more reasonable.

Dear Govenor Bush,

I heard about this proposed hospital on the Radio, I think it is a
great idea for our community.  Here is some brief information.

Nemours Children's Hospital will bring a highly specialized, pediatric
focused, endowed institution to Central Florida.

The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on
the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered
in this region and establishing a location where medically complex
pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one
seamless system of care.

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus
that will support research, physician and health care worker
education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's
Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill
jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide
destination for health care.

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of
their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of
the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children
need, they will receive.

Subject:	OPPAGO report on DOR and child support

To:  OPPAGA & Gov. Bush
 
There is one problem with Florida DOR and child support that they refuse to justify.  They refuse to produce, per public records requests,  the amount of money they spend in individual cases in their efforts to collect child support. 
 
 I assert that there are some cases that they are wasting up to $300,000 in litigation fees, incarcerations, etc. and getting little in return except keeping their cushy jobs at our expense!
 
Some of these noncustodial parents are indigent, yet DOR and the Florida Attorney General's Office  continue to harass them, report false arrearages to credit bureaus, refuse to modify court orders, search private banking records or non parties, take driver's licenses, excessively garnish and leave no self support reserve,  and put these parents in jail.  Gestapo tactics, very scary.
 
I assert that this agency needs to be thoroughly investigated for wrongdoing for the harm it has done to destroy Florida families.
 
As far as giving noncustodial parents due process in court, that is a joke when you have the Florida Attorney General's Office defending DOR's actions and even illegally representing the custodial parent in court!!  Further, additions to the joke is that judges and hearing officers are in mandatory "cooperation" with the DOR and CSE.  In some cases the county District Attorney's office is also the legal service provider for child support enforcement and have a lucrative contract with the state!!  What kind of due process can a noncustodial parent get under these "judicial cooperating" circumstances??!!
 
The state has no business getting itself involved in family law matters.  These cases should be resolved in civil cases between the parents themselves.  Parents have been taking care of their own kids since the Declaration of Independence was signed.  
 
Strong-arming, punishing,  and throwing parents in debtor's prisons in not the answer and will not work......  OPPAGA needs to get the public record for suspended driver's licenses in Florida, and the number of parents jailed in Florida in all 67 counties for child support.  You would be amazed....

WESTON · Now that the Broward County school district has approved a new high school for the Pembroke Pines-Miramar area, parents here are wondering if they will receive the same treatment. 

More than 200 parents learned they had reason to worry after a community forum Thursday night at Cypress Bay High School, hosted by officials from the Broward school district and the city of Weston.

The parents who spoke said they question if the district is acting quickly enough to find a site to build the proposed high school, designated MMM, to relieve overcrowding at Cypress Bay High.

School officials told parents that land is scarce in the Weston area and said the district has tried in vain for three years to find a suitable home for MMM.

District leaders said they have been hopeful since July when the city of Weston identified a parcel of pastureland that could be used for MMM, located south of Weston Regional Park and west of South Post Road.

But the South Florida Water Management District owns the land and the deal hinges on the state agency accepting a proposed land swap. Weston City Manager John Flint admitted the project has "lots of hurdles to cross" and that the city would not know if it's doable until closer to the end of the year.

The available property is partially wetlands, and water district rules dictate that prospective developers buy other land to preserve, to offset wetlands loss.

Parents questioned if MMM was not headed for a similar fate as LLL, the high school recently approved for west Pembroke Pines and Miramar after a three-year delay. 

"Stop looking at property that's not feasible," said Lisa Koscs, of Southwest Ranches, a parent of an eighth-grader zoned to attend Cypress Bay next year. "You're wasting too much time. You have to look at other areas."

MMM would ease crowding at Cypress Bay, which serves Weston, Southwest Ranches and part of Davie.

Earlier this month, enrollment counts showed that the district has lost more than 8,000 students compared to last year. The drop prompted district officials and School Board members to say they would re-evaluate building projects. But School Board member Marty Rubinstein said that the decline would not reduce the need for MMM.

"We're down in enrollment [across the county] but not in this area," Rubinstein said. "The trend is a bit slower than it was, but it's still up."

At Cypress Bay, student population increased from 5,075 in fall 2005 to 5,330 this year.

The school opened in fall 2002 and has grown to become the most populated high school in the state of Florida.

The listed capacity for the Cypress Bay is only 3,400, but the school copes by using portable classrooms and sending its 1,400 freshmen to a satellite campus.

Why not:
 
Instead of building a school on 1 floor - why not build a few floors - like a condo - i.e. 1st floor general adm offices, cafeteria, computer rooms, library
2 floor math
3 floor english
4 floor history/governent
This way you do not need as much land and it will ease the crowded Cypress Bay High School - this can be done if minds get together and not politics.

When are property taxes going to be capped or decreased and what is to be done w/the insurance for homeowners?  If a company is not willing to sell insurance for homes, then they should not be allowed to sell health, life, or auto insurance here either--they shouldn'tbe allowed to pick and choose what type of insurance they wish to sell--it should be all or nothing.

Dear Governor Bush,
I tried to scan my tax bill but I figured you would not open an attachment. The taxes on my property last year were $720.62 the proposed are $2,972.59 the taxable value $33,460 now $146,055. I am a licensed Real Estate agent and this is my first purchase for speculation. I know there is no homestead exemption and the assessing board can up the taxes after a sale but this is ludicrous!! The house has sold three times since 1996 so there has been opportunity for increases.  I have talked to the property appraiser and they can not help. Please help me lower these excessive taxes.

Subject:	Increase in Property Insurance

Dear Gov. Bush,

My name is Niki Goenaga and I am a business woman down in Dade County, FL.
The increase in property insurance is making it increasingly difficult for
me to conduct business.  As a prime example, I will state that I am part
owner of a beautiful Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel six miles north of the Miami
Airport.  My partners and I have been trying to sell the hotel for two years
now and every time we have had a deal on the table, it falls through because
of outrages insurance hikes.  The cost of doing business increases and the
deal is compromised.  It turns out that back in 2003 you could get full
cover on the hotel with wind for $250K.  Earlier this year, it was up to
$500K and the most recent buyer on the hotel could not get anything under
$1M.  These are numbers that make it unrealistic for anyone to be able to
run a profitable business.

My mother, who has no mortgage on her house, has always been a stay at home
mom.  She divorced from my father over 18 years ago.  She has lived off the
amount that she was given from the divorce settlement since then.  Her
property insurance recently increased to $7K.  She could not afford it and
was about to cancel her policy when I found out about.  I am now paying my
mother's property insurance because I could not risk her losing her home if
some catastrophe were to happen.  But what if I did not have the means to
help her with this?

I am sure you know that there are many more stories like these.  The
financial strain of having to deal with these situations has put me under
financial pressures that I never would have imagined given that I am a
successful business person.  It makes me consider selling everything, if I
could, and getting a regular job like everyone else.  I can't imagine
something more devastating to our economy than for the small business sector
to become stagnant. But, of course, that is not the only part of the economy
that is being severely affected by the outrages hikes in property insurance.

Gov. Bush, I ask that you please call on whomever is necessary to find a
solution to this problem.

Sincerely,
Niki Goenaga

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:
 
I know that you have heard recently time and time again that the high cost of insurance and real estate taxes needs to be addressed. Although I see small steps being taken these extremely high costs have stopped the real estate market and there will be more foreclosures over the next several months than ever before. 
 
The coffers of each local municipality throughout Florida have grown to where there has been a tremendous cash windfall over the past 4 to 5 years but somehow the money gets spent where the local governments continue to rape the public. No one can afford to move any more and the proposed 3% rule is just not enough. Example, I sold my house last year and the new buyer is now paying 4 times from what I paid in taxes. I have built a house and my taxes which are ridiculously high now for raw land will jump well over $20,000 next year. Why? Sure values have gone up but the State has let things get out of hand and now the Real Estate Market will suffer for years to come. 
 
I say you not only need to put a cap on taxes but develop a formula such as lower the tax mileage rate and to make up the difference by charging what they do in commercial real estate, a capital gains tax. If a homeowner is making a profit on the sale of their home they would not think twice about paying a surcharge when they sell to help keep taxes lower while living in the property.
 
I don't have a suggestion for the insurance problem brought on by recent hurricanes but something needs to be done. Again this burden is also adding to the death of real estate. Maybe the State needs to charge an additional tourist tax to help subsidise this industry.
 
By the way I am a licensed Realtor in Florida and have been for thirty years and have seen the ups and downs of the market place but now I see a situation which may hurt us all for years to come. Thank goodness I own a property management company in Broward County and do not depend on real estate sales to make a living.

Dear Governor Bush
 
Thank you for your dedicated service to the people of Florida. You have provided great leadership and Florida is an example to other states of how state government should operate. 
 
My concern is with the lack of local governmental support for Nemours' plan to build a children's hospital in Orlando. 

Mike Thomas of the Orlando Sentinel wrote an editorial on September 19 that motivated me to write you. He asserts that  the City of Orlando and Orange County are failing to actively endorse the building of a children’s’ hospital to placate Orlando Regional. I hope not. This is a booming community and the children of Orlando and Central FL deserve the utmost in child care. It would be an absolute shame to have a nationally renowned pediatric specialty group like Nemours withdraw their offer because of the failure of the community to support and accept the gift.

 

My hope is that the State of Florida is not making the same mistake as the local leaders are in Orlando. I would ask that you publicly support Nemours' plan to benefit the children of Central Florida.

 

Thank you and again, thanks for your service.

Dear Governor,

I cannot afford to adequately provide for my family due to my property taxes
increasing from $3300.00 last year to $8,300 this year simply because I
moved from a home that was worth approx $320,000 to a new home worth
$420,000 because I felt that the safety and well being of my family was
threatened in what was a "bad" neighborhood.  I have filed a petition with
the property tax review board, however i am not holding my breath.  With a
5% sales tax, self employment taxes, payroll taxes etc, and the rising cost
of insurance, it costs me around $35,000 per year just to be in the sunshine
state.

I believe that you would serve your people well if you would eliminate the
homestead exemptions and implement an equitable system such as that in
California which limits taxes to 1% of the property value.

Please contact me if you have any questions or need any additional

Dear Governor Bush,

As a long-time Central Florida resident, a parent, and a grandparent, I urge you to publicly endorse Nemours Foundation's efforts to gift Orlando with a state-of-the-art children's hospital. Nemours will pay to build and operate the hospital without any cost to the citizens of Florida. You and I should be welcoming Nemours' philanthropic offer with open arms. Instead, a small group of people within the local healthcare industry have focused the public discussion on predictions of lost revenue to their business. Please be clear .. these few people do not speak for all Central Florida residents!

Nemours Children's Hospital will be a tremendous economic boost to our economy. The information below provides the numbers and statistics. However, building the new Nemours Children's Hospital in Central Florida is not about the money... its about the kids. I hope you will join me in publicly endorsing Nemours' efforts to improve the healthcare of our children.

(from the website: www.orlandokids.org )

 

Nemours Children's Hospital will bring a highly specialized, pediatric focused, endowed institution to Central Florida. 

The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered in this region and establishing a location where medically complex pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one seamless system of care. 

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus that will support research, physician and health care worker education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide destination for health care. 

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children need, they will receive. 

Growth Information: 

*	Florida’s pediatric population is growing rapidly and 10-15% of the children born in any given year will need specialized pediatric care. Moreover, that percentage is on the rise. 
*	By 2030, Florida will have the third largest pediatric population in the country (source: U.S. Census Bureau.) Between 2000 and 2030, Florida will gain more than 2 million children. This large and growing population needs access to the specialized services that Nemours will offer. 
*	The number of children admitted to a hospital in Central Florida grew by 37% in the past five years, from 11,684 admissions to 16,029; however, the number of pediatric hospital beds shrank by 24% during that time, from 328 beds to 249 beds. (source: Health Council of East Central Florida)

Economic Impact Information: 

*	Nemours has contributed more than $550 million to Central and North Florida since 1980 as evidence of its commitment to the children of Florida. 
*	There will be no fundraising or community contributions solicited to build this hospital. No tax dollars or government resources are required. 
*	Nemours has offered a gift to the Central Florida community that includes: 

*	$250-300 million capital investment in a top-tier children's hospital 
*	$30-40 million annual mission investment in a children's hospital (double the current mission investment in the existing Nemours Children's Clinic in Orlando) 
*	1,500 potential jobs with an economic impact of over $350 million in Central Florida 

*	Central Florida will have access to the Nemours Biomedical Research Program, ranked 13th in 2004 NIH funding among children’s hospitals. 
*	Today, there are presently 103 Nemours clinicians and 17 PhD lab heads involved in biomedical research programs. Those numbers would increase with a children’s hospital in Orlando. 
*	Nemours academicians produce almost 250 peer-reviewed contributions to journals, books and chapters annually. Nemours contributes several million dollars annually to the cost of the programs. 

Nemours children's health care system and hospital will serve as the catalyst for a broad-ranging advocacy program aimed at addressing issues affecting the quality of life and health status for children. Nemours will collaborate with other health care providers, community agencies, and related pediatric organizations to further pediatric advocacy.

Hi Governor Bush

I would like to give just a thought on how to correct
the property tax situation:

All municipalities have a budget that they need to
exist and operate.  When property prices soar as they
did in Florida property taxes also increase and tend
to penalize those downsizing or family up sizing. 
Because of the windfall of money from taxes I am
concerned that it will be used in the budget creating
a new and exaggerated budget.

Why don't we just allow them to take their budget,
give them a 3% allowable increase and then decrease
the millage rate to keep property taxes reasonable.  I
don't see why this can't be on a floating basis
because if not we will continue to allow local
governments to become bloated instead of controlling
the issue and allow for a reasonable gain.  

I have to control my spending and even cut back at
times so why shouldn't the local governments.  My
concern is that with the new revenue base we will
adjust up to that base and be no better off then we
were.  

Thanks for listening

Subject:	Property taxes and insurance crisis

Dear Dr. Bush: 

I am writing to urge you to put together a special legislation session on property taxes and high insurance costs that have plaqued Florida residents over the past several years.  

We need to change legislation on property taxes in that your homestead follows you whether you upgrade to a bigger house or downsize to a smaller house.  Property tax has risen by 27-50% and as a Floridian I cannot afford to pay thousands of dollars in property taxes.  For example I purchased a new home last May and the property tax was $8,300 now I have received a proposed bill of $11,500 an increase of 27%.  I believe the $8,300 was already too high but $11,500 is outrageous.  It is a sad day when you look at your mortgage statement and you are paying more for property tax than the principal and interest.  I believe there needs to be an adjustment to the homestead exemption in that the 3% cap either needs to be reevaluated on property every 5 years or the exemption increased for new property owners.  New property owners are taking on the tax burden while their neighbor whom have lived in there house for 30 years is paying dismal taxes.  You cannot expect people to want to come to Florida for new jobs or to retire when the property tax is TOO HIGH.  What do you plan to do about this???

Another problem in real estate is investment property.  There needs to be a cap on this as well because what is happening is the owner of the property has to pass high property taxes onto the renter who is already in a financial bind.  There is talk about a 6% cap but whatever it is it needs to be fair for all not like the 3% cap on homestead.  My new taxes for my investment property has gone up 27% from the previous year that essentially had only been rising by 9%.  My income has not increased by 27% nor has rent prices been increasing by 27%.  Most people are lucky if they receive a 4% increase on their income. 

Lastly, our homeowners insurance costs are way too high.  I can't believe that insurance companies are allowed to back out of Florida and also not write any new policies.  While storms do devastate areas and claims are filed, they are not filed all over Florida.  So why should all of our premiums increase and some policies cancelled for the insurance companies do not want to insure Florida homes.  I believe the claims that were filed did not cause any insurance company to go bankrupt they are just upset for they did not make millions of dollars that year.  While many had claims there are still many more that did not have any claims.  Why punish all when only some have homes that are in hurricane or flood zone areas.

As a devout Republican and a strong supporter of you and your brother George W., I urge you to make these 3 things a priority and call to order a special legislation session to help Floridians.  I hope we can count on your help!!  Please feel free to contact me at sparsons@amgen.com  or on my cell phone at 813-624-2429.

The Honorable Governor Bush 

How in the world does the State of Florida expect the normal everyday working citizen to absorb the price increases we have seen in Bay County property tax and insurance premiums?   We bought a home in Bay County a few years ago with the intention of retiring there.    As we were making our plans and budgets we allowed for the normal increases in cost of living but had no idea our property tax would increase in one year by 150% and our wind insurance policy by 153%.  How is this explained?   We have attended every Bay County council meeting, met with the property appraisers and insurance representatives just to hear this is all your fault.  The property appraisers answer to our complaint was to sell our house if we thought we could....... Now what kind of answer was that?  When we talked to the insurance agent he told us we could either cancel our policy or raise the deductible to an amount that if we had a claim the deductible would be so high it would not do us any good to have it.  The property tax can be paid quarterly which helps in not having to pay out a lump sum of $4500.  However, the insurance companies will not let you pay the annual premium except for the full amount.  Now I realize that $6000.  would be a very meager amount to you but on a salary of $50M a year that is quite a bit for me.  Also, I have always understood that the state lottery was to support the schools and educational system yet 57% of my property tax is for schools.  Please explain what that is about.  What is going on with the State of Florida, are you trying to run us out or just have everyone put on state assistance? I know I will hear the word Katrina but I think we have beat that dead horse!!  I think after receiving the answer I did from a public official concerning our property tax I deserve some answers from your office and would appreciate a reply.

I would like to take this time to express my concern that this wonderful, proposed Children’s Hospital (which would not cost our city/ county government or taxpayers a cent) would be denied the opportunity to open up in Orlando. I would hate to think that the two major hospitals here in Orlando (ORMC and Florida Hospital) could keep our ever growing lower to middle income community from having the healthcare needed for our children. Our two major hospitals are overcrowded and do not have a good plan in place for dealing with the underprivileged needs of our community.

 

Please give your support to this wonderful project, which will not only help our children, but create hundreds of jobs here in Orlando as well. It is a win –win for us and I cannot see that it would take anything away from our two existing hospitals. After all, isn’t good healthcare about helping the children and less fortunate of our community, not about the amount of profit made at one institution or another?

 

Thank you for your time and I do hope you will help this proposed “gift” to Orlando happen.

Since sending this email to Governor Bush over a month ago, I have had communications with Janice Gilley regarding our critical problem. I have also emailed the Governor's office several detailed communications that fully address the scope of the problem, as well as how it is impacting over 2000 homeowners in our community as well as our local economy.

Janice indicated that the Governor could possibly address this critical issue by calling for a special legislative session and propose a workable remedy. I know that Janice has communicated with several others within your administration, including the Lt. Governor.

I have already contacted the Department of Financial Services but have yet to receive a response. Our mayor has also appealed to Governor Bush by writing to him personally. 

Our local newspaper is following our activities, and reporting on our progress (and lack thereof). Please forward to the Governor a copy of my Letter to The Editor which should hit the street soon. It reiterates the scope and seriousness of this urgent matter and proposes a viable solution. I am sending it to you under separate cover.

As Governor Bush is approaching the end of his term as our Chief Executive, it would be nice if he could help the untold thousands of homeowners and taxpayers who find themselves totally vulnerable to the threat of another major storm, and to date -- totally abandoned by our government at both the state and federal levels.

We need the Governor's immediate and personal attention to this urgent matter.
Please help.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to you to ask that you support and encourage the Orlando leaders to support the Nemours Foundation in building a children's hospital in Orlando.  I have had personal experience with the Nemours group when my son was a patient at the Orlando Nemours Endocrinology Clinic.  They have top-notch physicians and supportive staff.  
This hospital would be good for Orlando and Florida and the children.

Dear Governor Bush:

I have always been proud to support you and your family and the 
Republican Party. I ask that you now please add your support
to the future for Florida's Children by helping the Dream of Nemours 
Children's Hospital come to Orlando. I know you support
competition in the marketplace, as I do, and know that with the 
tremendous things that are happening in Orlando and the rest of
Florida, they could only be enhanced by a Private contribution of 
millions of dollars into the Orlando economy. This would not only
make our current health care professionals more efficient but would 
bring much needed research and support for the continued welfare of all 
our children, present and future. Please don't let this fantastic 
opportunity get away. I trust you will do the right thing and thank you 
for your service to our state. Thanks again.


Respectfully

Key Points in Support of Nemours Children’s Hospital Orlando


Nemours Children's Hospital will bring a highly specialized, pediatric focused, endowed institution to Central Florida. 

The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered in this region and establishing a location where medically complex pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one seamless system of care. 

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus that will support research, physician and health care worker education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide destination for health care. 

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children need, they will receive. 

Growth Information: 

*	Florida’s pediatric population is growing rapidly and 10-15% of the children born in any given year will need specialized pediatric care. Moreover, that percentage is on the rise. 
*	By 2030, Florida will have the third largest pediatric population in the country (source: U.S. Census Bureau.) Between 2000 and 2030, Florida will gain more than 2 million children. This large and growing population needs access to the specialized services that Nemours will offer. 
*	The number of children admitted to a hospital in Central Florida grew by 37% in the past five years, from 11,684 admissions to 16,029; however, the number of pediatric hospital beds shrank by 24% during that time, from 328 beds to 249 beds. (source: Health Council of East Central Florida)

Economic Impact Information: 

*	Nemours has contributed more than $550 million to Central and North Florida since 1980 as evidence of its commitment to the children of Florida. 
*	There will be no fundraising or community contributions solicited to build this hospital. No tax dollars or government resources are required. 
*	Nemours has offered a gift to the Central Florida community that includes: 

*	$250-300 million capital investment in a top-tier children's hospital 
*	$30-40 million annual mission investment in a children's hospital (double the current mission investment in the existing Nemours Children's Clinic in Orlando) 
*	1,500 potential jobs with an economic impact of over $350 million in Central Florida 

*	Central Florida will have access to the Nemours Biomedical Research Program, ranked 13th in 2004 NIH funding among children’s hospitals. 
*	Today, there are presently 103 Nemours clinicians and 17 PhD lab heads involved in biomedical research programs. Those numbers would increase with a children’s hospital in Orlando. 
*	Nemours academicians produce almost 250 peer-reviewed contributions to journals, books and chapters annually. Nemours contributes several million dollars annually to the cost of the programs. 

Nemours children's health care system and hospital will serve as the catalyst for a broad-ranging advocacy program aimed at addressing issues affecting the quality of life and health status for children. Nemours will collaborate with other health care providers, community agencies, and related pediatric organizations to further pediatric advocacy.

Subject:	NEMOURS ORLANDO

Dear Governor Bush and State officials ,

 

If you have impact upon the decision to allow or not allow Nemours to increase the medical service to the pediatric patients in and around the Orlando area; please don’t allow ORMC and Florida Hospital call the shots. I’m certain you have seen even more key points than I (an average citizen Mom with Kids) have as to the value of and need for the proposed Nemours Hospital.

 

I don’t need to copy and paste them into this letter…..

 

My argument is pretty simple, with two points.

1)     In any industry, competition spurs advancements and better service. Sometimes the consumer even gets to enjoy a lower cost, though I’m not counting on it in this case. Why not allow it, as Nemours is bringing a ton of money to the table? Additionally, the medical industry around Orlando will be augmented by this hospital along with the new med school, Burnham, the growth of ORMC and Florida Hospital.

2)     If we want to put our money where our mouths are, why not become a destination for fine medical care of kids? We don’t want to be just for tourism; we want to grow the medical school, the medical research community, etc. – so why not allow it? Politics. I vote republican every time, but I’m starting to believe it just doesn’t matter. I always believed that the party I’m a member of stands for free enterprise and the underlying belief that the cream will rise to the top naturally. Yet ORMC and Florida Hospital are digging their heels in and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty is backing off….. sickening. As a resident of Seminole Co., my life is directly affected by this decision, yet I don’t even have a vote to tell Crotty what I think of all of this. 

 

Please Consider my thoughts if you have any impact on the final decision.

Dear Governor Bush:

Please support the building of Nemours Hospital in Orlando. The politics behind the road blocks to this initiative are very disheartening for the citizens. I want my grandchildren to have access to the best healthcare available if the need arises. I also want that healthcare to be available to the children I mentor in Paramore, who could not pay for that kind of medical care.  Everything about Nemours coming to Orlando is GOOD. Why do we, the citizens, need to make an outcry for something that is obviously great for our city and our people? Isn’t that what elected officials are supposed to do?

Subject:	Yes to Nemours Orlando

Governor Bush,

I am writing you today to voice my approval for Nemours Pediatric 
Hospital to be built in the Orlando area. I was extremely upset to hear 
that their initial application was denied. To be told that there is no 
need for this hospital is absurd. Central Florida is a rapidly growing 
area and the need will only become greater.The number of pediatric 
hospital beds shrank by 24% during the past five years, from 328 beds to 
249 beds. (source: Health Council of East Central Florida) The benefits 
this organization would bring to the area are great. Orlando and Orange 
County are currently trying to make their vision of a biomedical 
community a reality. This would only serve to accomplish this dream. 
Nemours would bring access to their Biomedical Research Program which is 
a perfect fit for the area, especially since UCF has a medical school 
set to open in the next couple of years. Medical students would have the 
opportunity to work with world class doctors in a specialized field. We 
are willing to offer the Scripps Institute and Burhman millions of 
dollars in an attempt to lure them to our area, but Nemours WANTS to 
build HERE with NO money from taxpayers and we say no? This makes no 
sense. Nemours would be a great asset to our community and an economic 
catalyst with 1,500 estimated high paying, high skilled jobs and a 
potential impact of over $350 million. If children are our future, 
aren't we doing them a serious disservice by not letting Nemours come to 
Central Florida? You are passionate about children's education, what 
about their health? I seriously hope that you will use your power to 
make Nemours Orlando a reality. Voters in Central Florida are looking to 
you, our local elected leaders, and Dr. Hitt of UCF to lead the way.

Sincerely,
Richard Gosnay

Subject:	Re: Home Insurance

Thank you for your answer to my letter. It seems you miss the point. As I read the letter, you point out many different ways in which the state will help compensate lower income and moderate income home owners. All well and good. It seems you feel that the condo owners of the state can pay for everyone else who can't insure there homes. Why can't the Condo owners associations provide there own insurance by self insuring there own property? Why should the Insurance companies steel from the properties that can provide for themselves in order to subsidize substandard properties?                                                                        In our case we pay a total premium of $800,000 with a deductible of over $1.8 million. for 
 Buildings that are built to the current hurricane specifications of the state of Florida. As you say in your canned letter, We will get insurance discounts or we can raise our deductible to 5% and we will save 10% on our premium. What a deal! Now our premium will be $720,000 and the likelihood of us sustaining almost $2million in damages is as much chance of seeing a blue moon. Why should we indoor 100% increases on wind damage just because there might be more hurricanes this season? Seems to me you have taken the rights away from the condo owner so the insurance companies can fill there coffers with our hard earned money. It's time to put some common sense into the insurance industry and stop this out right rape of the taxpayers of Florida. I'm very angry. I am also on the Board of Director of my Condo Assoc. and if this continues many of our resident will be unable to pay there Condo fees. When you couple the ever increasing Taxes and Utility bills I'm afraid there won't be any as you say, robust economy.

Dear Governor Bush:

Please forgive me for bothering you again but I don't want this issue to get lost in the bureauocracy.  I sent you the attached letter and was answered by Tiffany McClellan.  I responded to her and was called by phone by Sarah.  Sarah said the actions by Santa Rosa County had been ruled legal by the court and that you did not have jurisdiction over the court.  I am familiar with the separation of powers, etc. but I believe, as Governor, you have sigificant INFLUENCE over the Dept of Revenue and Santa Rosa County.  I am asking that, even if legal, the ad valorem taxes, on top of the lease payments, be stopped ,OR, that the properties be transferred to us, fee simple, and the leases be abolished.  I know you are not running for re-election but your legacy depends on how you treat your constituency.

Thank you for your help.

Sir,

 

About 5 years ago we finally scraped and saved enough money to buy a house in Florida, our home state, and planned to retire there.  

 

When we bought the property for $300,000 and taxes were around $2000 a year.

 

Now that we are ready to retire we can no longer afford to live in Florida because the property taxes have more that tripled; they are now over $7000, even though the value of the property has not escalated accordingly.  It has not even doubled.  I would be very lucky to be able to sell it for $600,000.  As a matter of fact we will be hard pressed to sell it at all due to these taxes.  

 

For all the years that my husband was on active duty we tried to get stationed in Florida.  After he retired and we became GS employees we once again, unsuccessfully, tried to obtain employment in Florida.  In order to stay employed we had to go where the jobs were – and they were not in Florida.  

 

Why are we penalized for not being able to live on the property and are charged these outrages taxes?  Home owners who have been fortuned enough to be able to remain in Florida pay far less property tax then we do.  We understand that we have to pay the out of state tax rate, but we don’t think it is fair that we are being gouched.

 

Is that the thanks we get for serving our country?  We are  angry, disappointed and outraged.  Our retirement has definitely been ruined.

 

We respectfully request that the tax laws will be changed.

dear computer generated generic letter
you forgot about the tax increase complaint
which is effecting us too!
From a real person
Governor Jeb Bush <Jeb.Bush@MyFlorida.com> wrote:

Thank you for your letter about property insurance.  
 
Insurance is the number one issue facing our state today.  Two unprecedented back-to-back hurricane seasons – with eight hurricanes and four tropical storms – caused $36 billion in insurance claims.  According to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, annual insured losses in years without a major storm average $2.8 billion.
 
Predictions of more catastrophic hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. have triggered significant increases in insurance premiums to cover potential future losses.  Many insurance companies have dropped policies and restricted new policies to avoid high risk areas and reduce overall exposure in Florida.  Homeowners who cannot get private insurance have only two options, no insurance or insurance from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, which has the highest rates in the state.
 
This is a serious situation.  Higher rates and the inability to get private insurance have created a significant hardship for many homeowners and small businesses. Moreover, Florida cannot maintain a robust economy and high quality of life if our state continues to sustain tens of billions of dollars in damage every year.  
 
The key to solving the problem is fortifying Florida against the potential damage of future storms.   Reducing the risk of damage will reduce estimated cost of future disasters, which should stabilize rising insurance premiums.
 
You can take steps today to protect your home and reduce your insurance premium.  Florida requires insurance companies to give a discount on insurance premiums – as much as 44% on your wind policy – for certain improvements that guard against wind damage.  Choosing a higher insurance deductible, either 2% or 5%, can also reduce your premium.  
 
To help homeowners make these improvements, the state is providing $250 million for the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program, a new program to perform free home inspections and provide matching grants to qualified homeowners who harden their homes against wind damage.  Qualified homeowners that make approved improvements to their primary residences may be eligible for reimbursement by the state, dollar-for-dollar up to $5,000.  Qualified low-income homeowners may be eligible for up to $5,000 in improvements without providing any matching funding.  The Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program is managed by the Department of Financial Services.  For information about how to apply for the grant, please visit www.mysafefloridahome.com.     
 
To provide immediate relief to policyholders, the state provided $715 million to Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to offset the company’s deficit and reduce the surcharge assessed on all policyholders – not just those with coverage from Citizens.  Without this funding, your insurance policy would have increased an additional $172.48 for every $1,000 of your insurance premium.
 
To increase the availability of private insurance, the state is providing $250 million for a new Insurance Capital Build-up Incentive Program to provide matching funds for insurance companies bringing new capital to the market.  This program will enable private insurance companies to underwrite more policies.  
 
On August 8, Lt. Governor Toni Jennings held the first meeting of the Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee.  This committee is open to all ideas to bring down the cost of premiums, increase availability of affordable insurance and reduce the risk to homeowners and taxpayers.  If you would like to make a suggestion, please visit www.myfloridainsurancereform.com. 
 
Thank you again for your letter.  I am committed to finding a solution to ease the financial burden that you and many other Florida homeowners are facing with the rising cost and declining availability of insurance.
 
                                                            Sincerely,

Dear Jeb Bush
I am very concerned about the insurance and tax crisis in Florida
Yes it is effecting me I own rentals insurance/taxes have hit the roof
on one property alone its gone from 1200 to 3711.  The rental rates have not gone up to cover these increases.  Yet your local government has hit us on taxes too
A vacant piece of land went from 200 to 2000. These increase are unheard of 
in most countries is there some reasoning for this? Other than greedy insurance companies and Government.  It looks like it comes down to you and your approval to make all of these increases.  
 
Had any one asked me prior to these last 2  years do you have a good living I would
have replied Yes!! Now I  am not bringing enough money to make the bills and
am dropping my own homeowners, don't have health insurance and am working another job. You do the math.

Subject:	Property Tax State of Emergency in Manatee County

September 27, 2006

 

Dear Governor Bush,

 

The Manatee County Board of County Commissioners recently passed a Budget for 2006/07 which included a 15.4% increase over the previous years budget.  During the public hearings I wrote letters to my Commissioner (Donna Hayes), and to the Chair of the Board of County Commissioners of Manatee County to plead for fiscal responsibility on their part.  I have attached below the letter sent to the Honorable Joe McClash, Chair of the Board of County Commissioners.

 

Specifically, I pointed out that Manatee County’s population has grown by about 2.5% over the last year, and that CPI has increased by about 3.4%.  A responsible board would have brought in a budget which was perhaps 5 – 6 % higher, year over year.

 

I also pointed out that the budget increase would be bourn by non-homesteaded property taxpayers, like myself, who would be facing, on average, a 22.5% property tax increase as a result of this budget. 

 

However, the Manatee County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved the increased budget.  

 

Governor Bush, please help us.  We have gotten nowhere by approaching our local County representatives.  We cannot afford the property tax increases and irresponsible spending that our local government has undertaken.

 

Yours truly,

Attachment:  Letter to Manatee County Board of County Commissioners

 

September 14, 2006

 

The Honorable Joe McClash, Chairman

Board of County Commissioners

Manatee County

 

Dear Mr. Chairman,

 

I have reviewed your proposed Annual Budget Document for Manatee County, Fiscal year 2006-2007, available on the web at www.co.manatee.fl.us/board/2006-2007_proposed_budget_book.pdf.

 

I am not able to attend your public review meeting coming up on September 19, 2006 at the Manatee County Administration Building, starting at 6pm.  I submit this letter as my input, and request that it be read/entered into the formal record of the hearing.

 

1.	This budget shows a total spending of $582,383,590, an increase of 15.4% over the previous year.  Over that same time period, the population increase in the County is about 2.5%, and the CPI is about 3.4%.  If the County were a business, and proposed an increase in spending of this magnitude under these realities, the Board of Directors would demand resignations or insist on a revamp showing that you can live within your means.  To my mind, this budget is nothing to be proud of – it simply represents a tax grab based upon increasing property values, with the increases being paid by non-homesteaded property taxpayers.

 

2.	Nowhere in this document do I read any clear reference to the impact this budget will have on the majority of property taxpayers in Manatee County, who happen to be not permanent residents of Florida!  This is indeed the largest audience for this Budget document, with over half of all property units in Manatee County owned by non-homesteaded taxpayers.  The chart on page 34 of the Budget document shows the impact on Manatee County property taxpayers who happen to qualify for the “Save Our Homes” cap and the Homestead exemption.  They may expect to see a tax decrease this year.  May I request that you add to this chart during your review meeting on September 19 to show the impact of this Budget on non-homesteaded taxpayers, your largest constituency?  Specifically, the Average Single-Family Home valued at $260,000 will see a tax increase of 22.5% for County services (based on the average home value increase of 24% and a 4.9% reduction in millage rate).  Please be open and clear with your largest constituency about this. It clarifies from where the 15.4% budget increase will be collected – non-homesteaded property taxpayers like myself. 

 

I am sure that you are aware that there is a major review being conducted by Governor Jeb Bush to fix the property tax system in Florida.  (See the Florida Property Tax Reform Committee website http://www.propertytaxreform.state.fl.us/default.htm.)  One of their mandates is to achieve equity – “The Florida tax system should treat similarly-situated taxpayers similarly.”  I pray to God that this will be achieved.  Then County and other tax increases currently being foisted on non-homesteaded taxpayers will be redistributed among all.  At that time I expect there will be considerably greater backlash against current and future proposed budget increases.

 Dear Governor Bush:
 
  The panel you appointed to study the outrageous assessed values of land in Mexico Beach and other parts of Florida cannot do a job fast enough to help ordinary people.
  I beg of you to consider signing an executive order to roll back property tax assessment until a realistic guideline has been established and put in place.
  We own property in Mexico Beach and are in danger of losing it if no relief is given to us.  Most of the people who own second homes there fully intended to move to Florida upon retirement.  However, with retirement comes more limited income.   Selling is out of the question because no one is buying when they would have to pay exorbitant amount of taxes each year in order to live in the great State of Florida.  We actually have in our property $155,000.00.  When you have to figure on paying $1000. to $1400. taxes monthly in order to be a good tax paying citizen, it is too much for retirement incomes for the average person.  We never bought our lot and built our retirement home for investment purposes.  We want to be citizens there.
  People over the age of 70 to 75 years old should not be hit with school taxes either.  I know you had a good thought when you decided to have the study but it is too little too late for most of us.
  Help keep the Republican Party on top in the United States.  Meet the challenge.  Do something and we will voting because that will show the Republicans are for the small people also. 
  This is the first letter I have ever written and my thoughts are that it will be wasted but I have to start somewhere and you are in the position to doing a fine thing for the seasonal and non seasonable residents of Florida.  The out of state people carry the burden of furnishing services for counties when they receive very little of these services.  
  People in Florida own homes in other states and they are not penalized because it is a second home so that is not a big argument.
  Please come forward to relief for us.
  Thank you,

I wanted to contact you to ask you to please do something quickly to correct the serious inequities in our property tax system.  Having moved to Alachua county from Palm Beach County in order to downsize I find that although I was able to "downsize" my property - now I am confronted with the highest taxes in the state of Florida.  I am in a worse situation than before I downsized!  This is absolutely NOT FAIR!  The current system is so unfair and I am paying the price dearly.  In many cases I am paying 3 to 4 times more in taxes than other residents who haven't sold and purchased a home in the last few years.  In fact I am paying more in my portion of the school taxes than my co-worker is paying in all of his property taxes -and he has a bigger house and 4 kids - and I have none!  Does that sound "fair" to you?  I am paying for services that I receive little to no benefit from and yet I am paying for everyone else who isn't paying their fair share taxes.  WHY IS THIS?  THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR!  Why do we have a tax system that taxes people for "moving" and "downsizing"?  While no one likes paying taxes the system we have today is totally irresponsible and inequitable.  I shouldn't be punished with an unfair burden of taxes because I had to sell my property and move.  The system needs to be completely changed to allow for EVERYONE to pay their fair share of taxes!

Dear Governor Bush:  RE:  Parcel ID 04626-000-000, Mexico Beach, Unit 5,
235C2, Lot ll, Blk 2

HELP!  HELP!  HELP!!!

I am a property owner, one small house located in Mexico Beach, FL. that I
had built in 1980.  Me and my family use the place for vacations, and other
times I rent it to tourists to help cover the costs of taxes, insurance,
maintenance and utilities.  I have owned it for 26 years.

Last week I got a notice from the Bay County Taxing Authority that my
property assessment was increased from $124,141 to a preposterous $550,290,
resulting in a proposed tax of $9935.58, up from $2257.16!  I am retired,
and depend on Social Security for 75% of my income.

I appeal to you, and the state legislature for relief of the unreasonable,
and unfair increase of the property tax based on several reasons:

1.   The lot is 75' X 100', and the house has 1075 square feet of living
space.  Surely not a huge estate!
2.   My lot is zoned single family residential, and cannot become a
mult-unit location, therefore only one residence can be built there.
3.   I rent the house during the summer to tourists who buy things, pay
sales taxes and contribute to the economy of the state.  If the tax is
allowed to stand in it's present form, I will be forced to raise my rent by
40% just to pay the tax.  It is quite possible that the rental increase will
cause a sharp reduction in occupancy.  In turn that reduction will cause me
personal economic problems, and the state of Florida will lose sales tax
revenue.  This is a douple loss, with probable ripple effect on businesses
that may fail or go away.
4.  If fair market value is to be used to appraise the land, then it must
include a reasonable leveler to avoid the huge increase in a 'tax windfall'
and permit a gradual scale of both increase and decline.
5.  The properties were assessed at the peak of 2005 where land speculation
was rampant.  If the appraisals were done today, they would be far short of
the boom prices seen last year.  A 'shock absorber' provision must be made
for these unusual and short lived spikes in property prices.
6.  It is basically unfair to allow different assessments for residents and
property owners who don't live in their second homes, or investment
properties.  I submit that this is a discrimination against investment or
vacation property owners.
7.  Ultimately, the single property owner like myself (and thousands of
others) who were able to scrimp and buy a vacation home years ago are being
singled out and financially punished for their foresight.

I've been told that you have refused to discuss this unfair, unwise and
anti-business appraisal system.  I hope that you will change your mind and
consider the consequences.  I won't be able to afford to keep my home in
Mexico Beach, and will be forced into selling the property.  That will also
punish me as the prices will have declined due to the tax inequity.  How can
you not be involved in correcting this situation?  The answer is you can't!

I respectfully ask that you find a way to give the thousands of us some
assistance.  If tourism is important to Florida, and I know it is, then this
situation must be fixed!

Dear Jeb,
 
This is the first time that I have actually written to any government official.  I have always sat back, and felt as if our government would eventually see the problems at hand, and then do it's best to fix them.  I no longer feel this way.  I am probably finally taking a pro-active measure this time because property taxes, and insurance hikes are directly affecting my chosen line of work, and frankly, I'm really scared.  I'm a Building Contractor, Swimming Pool Contractor, and I have a Realtor Associates license, and with that many avenues of potential income allot of people would wonder why I would even take the time to worry, I used to think the same thing.  I was always taught not to put all your eggs into one basket, so I thought I would be pretty safe with a little diversity, but guess what, I'm not.  
 
Don't get me wrong, I realize that any business has to make a profit, or else they will cease to exist, but there is a problem with the insurance company's profit margins.  I'm sorry that they had a couple of years of high payouts, but as a whole, spread across the nation, they still profited.  It would be like me with my company deciding to charge double or triple to build a house or pool, just because next year may not be as profitable as I would like.  Of course it wouldn't work, because no one would ever use my services if they were so outrageously inflated.  That's the checks and balances of the general public, and those are the rules I have to live by.  It is those same balances that have compelled me to write to you.  People can make a decision on what product to buy, and whom to purchase it from when it is something that is a want, or a luxury item.  They can shop around and find someone they are happy with, and a price they can live with, because they have a choice, and they don't "have" to have the item.  The government, their bank, no one is forcing them to make the purchase.  On the other hand, taxes and insurance are "have toos"  the government forces taxes on land and value, and the government requires insurance on State Licensing.  Financial Institutions require Insurance on anything where they hold an interest.  I understand the need for all of the above, but as I stated before, If we cannot get away with gouging the public, and the public keeps us in check, then shame on you and the insurance companies, and we need to keep all of you in check.  
 
The value of property has sharply risen, but the cost of government has not risen at the same pace.  Consumers did drive the property values up so high by being willing to pay the high prices of property, but government is not supposed to be a "for profit" business.  Government just needs to cover the cost of operating, and little cushion for "just in case."  We shouldn't have to make up now for money mistakes you made in the past.  Lower the current millage rates on property to the point where government can exist, not profit.  Also, check into the outrageous impact fees being charged, in Hernando County, we have over a $10,000.00 impact fee for building, where just 3 years ago, it was only $2,000.00 a little excessive hu?  Insurance companies shouldn't be allowed to write any type of policies in the State of Florida if they are not willing to take the risk for homeowners insurance.  Why should we reward them with high returns on Health, life, auto or any other type of policies if they are not willing to stick their necks out a little also.  Personally, my personal homeowners policy almost tripled this year, and there is no logical reason for this.  Put a percentage cap on the amount that an insurance company can raise premiums in a year.  I'm sure there are many more ways to regulate the amount they can gouge the public.  Insurance is not a choice for most people, it's a "have to."  The people in your state are getting to the point where they just won't be able to keep it all together.  They will either leave or loose everything, and that is just not the right solution.  
 
I promise to do my part in helping to keep the economy stimulated, can you promise to do yours?

Governor Bush,
 
This is a letter to support the Nemours Children's Hospital to be located in Central Florida.  I am an Orange County Public School teacher and I feel that this hospital is truly a needed facility in our area.  Here are other important facts to consider:
 

Nemours Children's Hospital will bring a highly specialized, pediatric focused, endowed institution to Central Florida. 

The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered in this region and establishing a location where medically complex pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one seamless system of care. 

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus that will support research, physician and health care worker education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide destination for health care. 

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children need, they will receive. 

Growth Information: 

*	Florida’s pediatric population is growing rapidly and 10-15% of the children born in any given year will need specialized pediatric care. Moreover, that percentage is on the rise. 
*	By 2030, Florida will have the third largest pediatric population in the country (source: U.S. Census Bureau.) Between 2000 and 2030, Florida will gain more than 2 million children. This large and growing population needs access to the specialized services that Nemours will offer. 
*	The number of children admitted to a hospital in Central Florida grew by 37% in the past five years, from 11,684 admissions to 16,029; however, the number of pediatric hospital beds shrank by 24% during that time, from 328 beds to 249 beds. (source: Health Council of East Central Florida)

Economic Impact Information: 

*	Nemours has contributed more than $550 million to Central and North Florida since 1980 as evidence of its commitment to the children of Florida. 
*	There will be no fundraising or community contributions solicited to build this hospital. No tax dollars or government resources are required. 
*	Nemours has offered a gift to the Central Florida community that includes: 

*	$250-300 million capital investment in a top-tier children's hospital 
*	$30-40 million annual mission investment in a children's hospital (double the current mission investment in the existing Nemours Children's Clinic in Orlando) 
*	1,500 potential jobs with an economic impact of over $350 million in Central Florida 

*	Central Florida will have access to the Nemours Biomedical Research Program, ranked 13th in 2004 NIH funding among children’s hospitals. 
*	Today, there are presently 103 Nemours clinicians and 17 PhD lab heads involved in biomedical research programs. Those numbers would increase with a children’s hospital in Orlando. 
*	Nemours academicians produce almost 250 peer-reviewed contributions to journals, books and chapters annually. Nemours contributes several million dollars annually to the cost of the programs. 

Nemours children's health care system and hospital will serve as the catalyst for a broad-ranging advocacy program aimed at addressing issues affecting the quality of life and health status for children. Nemours will collaborate with other health care providers, community agencies, and related pediatric organizations to further pediatric advocacy.

Dear Governor Bush:

I attempted to send the following comments to your Committe for Florida 
Property Tax Reform ... but my comments were too long for its suggestion 
channel.  So, hopefully you will read and have delivered to your 
Committee.  Thanks.

Memo to:		Florida Property Tax Reform Committee

From:		E. Robert Fraser, Vero Beach, Florida    (772-                      
                     564-2698)

Date:		September 26, 2006

Re:	                     Improving property laws in Florida

I am a resident of Vero Beach, Florida and my residence qualifies for 
homestead exemption status.  I also own three other pieces of property in 
Florida, a rental/investment condominium in Indian River County, and two 
small vacant parcels of land on the Indian River in Brevard County.  My 
comments relate to the gross inequities existing in Florida’s property tax 
laws, in particular, the gross inequities caused by the 3% (or less) 
assessment cap on Florida “homestead” properties.  

Let’s say you own a vacant ½ acre parcel of land which has been appraised 
in 2006 for $500M.  Your neighbor’s ½ acre homestead property has been 
appraised for $1,500M.  And, let’s say the appraised values for both 
properties increased by 50% over the respective appraised values for 2005. 
 

As a result of the 3% annual assessment limitation for homestead 
properties, your neighbor’s property will be assessed for only 3% of its 
2005 assessed value.  However, your vacant parcel will be assessed for 
100% of its appraised value.  

Why the substantial difference in property tax obligations?  In 1992, an 
amendment to the Florida Constitution limited to 3% the amount the prior 
years tax assessment on a homestead status property could be increased.  
No such limitation was placed on increases in the assessment of properties 
which did not have homestead status.   

The 3% assessment cap on homestead properties may serve a legitimate 
social purpose for County residents who need financial assistance.  
However, should County homesteaders who do not require financial 
assistance be entitled to 3% assessment caps.   

Florida tax laws need to be amended so that all properties in Florida 
either do or do not have assessment caps.  If assessment caps are 
eliminated, there are other methods of furnishing tax relief to lower 
income property owners.  More importantly, if assessment caps are 
eliminated, voters with homesteads in their respective counties will have 
more incentive to demand that county officials be more accountable for 
budget increases for services and projects desired … but not needed by 
county residents.   

Florida’s tax laws as they apply to taxable properties are both arbitrary 
and unreasonable … resulting in gross inequities.  Vacant land property 
owners particularly are being financially raped as they receive virtually 
no benefit from the municipal services for which they are being taxed.  
There are constitutional issues which beg to be addressed, either by 
elected officials or by the courts.

…………………………………………………………..
Suggestion:   Eliminate assessment caps on all Florida properties … and 
authorize property tax exemptions in varying amounts dependent on income 
and net worth levels.

What affect will the above suggestion have on Florida communities?    
Among other affects, 
	- level out the tax obligations imposed on the various types of 
properties in Florida;
	-eliminate the gross inequities against non-homestead properties 
presently caused by existing laws;
	-allow the respective counties to determine to what extent tax relief 
should be granted to lower income/low net worth residents;
	-homesteaders (by reason of the fact that their assessments will be 
higher) will demand less discretionary projects and services from 
government authorities;
	-furnish residents owning homestead property with more incentive to 
challenge budgets with non-essential frills;
	-encourage  businesses to locate in areas where taxes are not heavily 
biased against business property;
	-eliminate the need for vacant property owners to liquidate their 
respective properties by reason of the unconscionable tax burden presently 
being imposed on such properties; and 
	-eliminate the need for landlords to substantially increase rents (to 
those not able to afford higher rents) by reason of the disproportionate 
tax increases on non homestead properties.

Why will my suggestion not be implemented?  It might be political suicide 
to foster legislation taking away from us homestead voters the 3% 
assessment cap.  It was a mistake to adopt this cap … and now might be a 
political nightmare to eliminate.  But it is the right thing to do.

Attachments:	Mike Thomas column, Sept. 19, 2006.pdf

Governor Bush,

I am appalled at the lack of leadership shown by local politicians on the Nemours Children's Hospital in Orlando.  Nemours will be bringing a highly specialized, pediatric focused, endowed institution to Central Florida.  Spending $350 million on construction, $40 million on annual operations,1,500 potential jobs with an economic impact of over $350 million in Central Florida, all without public funding, and no fund raising in the community -- this is a common sense economic development opportunity that local politicians don't get!  They are being intimidated by ORHS and their board into believing diversity in our health care services would be a bad thing.  The only person who seems to get it locally is Mike Thomas of the Orlando Sentinel and I have attached his most recent commentary on this for your review. Local leaders just spent $300 million on Burnham, millions in donations to UCF, and now are looking at spending over a billion dollars on a new sports center for the Magic, renovations to the Citrus Bowl, and building a new performing arts center these will drain any money that ORHS or Florida Hospital could possibly raise for their meager children hospital efforts.

As a lifelong Republican, and believer in free markets and capitalism I don't understand the position of local politicians, so I am writing to you to ask for leadership on a state level to support Nemours Orlando bid.  The state approval system is antiquated and biased towards protecting the incumbent hospitals.

Everyone in Central Florida is glowing about Burnham, the UCF Medical Center and the new VA hospital, how about rounding this out with a world class children hospital?  Neither Florida Hospital or ORHS has the money or ability to do what Nemours can today.  This would truly build Orlando into a medical powerhouse and add tremendously to our economic development, services to needy children and allow the existing hospitals to focus on areas they have a chance to excel in.  The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered in this region and establishing a location where medically complex pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one seamless system of care. 

Please help the people of Central Florida get the best medical treatment for children possible and show leadership on the state level, thank you.

Governor Bush,
 
Some people think that we have enough hospitals in Orlando, but we don't, not for  kids anyway.  My daughter got extremely sick two years ago.  We took her to two different hospitals where they did tests and then they sent us home with no answers and a terribly sick child.  We had to have blood drawn at our pediatician every other day for enemia and our daughter was losing to much weight,  couldn't eat anything and was dehydrated.  We again took her back to the hospital and they said she needed a pediatric GI and who happened to be on vacation for a month. They wanted to send us home and come back in a month.  We were desperate for answers and insisted that the hospital transfer us so a pediatric GI could diagnose our daughter.  Dr. Jeffrey Bornstein from Nemours graciously agreed to see our daughter.  Within  a week, tests were scheduled, my daughter was diagnosed and put on medicine that has improved the quality of her life.  Recently newspaper articles are speculating on the growth of Orlando and its surrounding areas.  If it continues to grow at the projected rates, then our kids are going to need another hospital to keep up with the growth.  Nemours has wonderful doctors for all kinds of child illnesses that they specialize in and our kids deserve it.

Our son received life-saving, quality care from the doctors at the Nemours Clinic in Orlando some ten years ago.

I strongly support private competition in all services, including health care.

Subject:	 Tax reform solution

 
To:  Gov. Bush,
 
 

I have a plan for property tax reform for Florida that I would like to share:
 
1.) Roll back taxable property assessment values to 2002 levels.  To these values, add  cost-of-living increases for each year from 2002 to current year.  Then cap the new taxable property assessment value and only allow yearly cost-of-living increases.  One side effect of this, I would think, is that it would eliminate the need for the bulk of the County Property Appraisers budget, a savings to the taxpayers of Florida.
 
2.) Cap the millage rates for all municipalities at the October 1, 2006 level.
 
3.)  With items 1 and 2 mandated, the municipalities may go to the voters, by referendum, for any other millage increases they feel necessary for capital improvements or any other wants or needs.
 
4.)  Make this plan effective as of October 1, 2007.
 
I think both non-homesteaded and homesteaded residential homes should be capped.  I think new construction residential should pay their way thru impact fees that reflect the effect on the infrastructure.  Commercial real estate, in my opinion, should have a separate assessment system, and divided by type of business.
 
This plan will force all municipalities to roll back their spending to a more acceptable and fiscally responsible level and allow the voters of the State of Florida to decide if and when they want to raise their taxes and exactly what those increased tax dollars will be spent on.

Honorable Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to voice my support of buiding the Nemours Hospital for Children in Orlando.  For once, we as taxpayers are not being asked for our dollars, but simply our support of a wonderful facility in our neighborhood.  I think it is ludicrous on the part of our city, county and state leaders to be lead around by their noses by self-serving Orlando Regional Healthcare. I am asking you to intervene on behalf of the children of our state and give Nemours the support it needs to facilitate its hospital.

Mr. Bush,
I'm writing to express my support for Nemours Children's Hospital. Please allow our community to sieze this opportunity for specialized pediatrics and economic growth by supporting this non-profit foundation's attempt to establish itself in Central Florida. The benefits we stand to gain by welcoming this institution into our midst is far too great to pass up. 

I am a resident of Orlando, Florida and a concerned citizen. I ask that you consider my view as decisions for Nemours are made.

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As you wind down your last term as Governor, you have the opportunity to deliver one more benefit to your constituents.
 
The offer from Nemours to build and provide operating expenses for a world class children's hospital in Orlando should get your very strong and very public support. The offer makes economic, development and humane sense.  And, it is entirely consistent with the public stances your administration has taken to bring Florida to a higher level in research, jobs and services to citizens.
 
The objections raised, primarily buy ORMC, reflect a "protectionist" mentality that says "this is my turf, and I do not want any 'outside' competitor opening for business here."  ORMC and Florida Hospital do provide "pretty good" services to the Central Florida community. And Florida, with the newly approved medical school at UCF, is investing to improve further the quality of service available to our fast growing communities.  Thank you!  But there is more that you can do: lobby actively for the approval and acceptance of this "gift" from Nemours.
 
The administrative process for insuring that hospitals do not "shoot themselves in the foot" by excessive expansion is a rational system, but it was set up to manage the 'normal' competitive excesses of providers, when their expansions ignored economic realities and let 'ego driven' plans endanger their long term viability. And, like all such administrative processes, it should 'flex' when a situation not originally contemplated arises.
 
Nemours' offer is just that case of an opportunity that the administrative system was not established to manage. Unfortunately, like most bureaucratic processes, the administrative system is not responding with flexibility.  The system is processing this offer as if it was a typical competition between ORMC and Florida Hospital over the number of beds for children.  It is not. This is a gift, from a world class institution, that can only make the entire system better,  through delivery of benchmark research and delivery services for children in Central Florida. It contributes to the 'cluster effect' for medical research, education and services that Florida needs and that your economic policies have supported.
 
You and other political leaders in Florida should advocate in favor of this gift, publicly and privately, in order to make the administrative process 'flex' in response to a unique and beneficial opportunity.

Subject:	Insurance & Property Tax Crisis

Time to stand together, and represent the people. We are being taxed to death, and the insurance premiums are driving many from Florida. The crisis is a problem that transcends party lines. Time for action, not just talk, talk, talk.
During the elections we hear all this rhetoric, promises, promises, promises. Once the person is elected do you ever go back and revisit what was promised and then find that little is really accomplished. Look at our Congress, all these issues pending. A do nothing Congress (Federal). State, much the same.
Perhaps its time to expand the State's property insurance company of last resort. Kick out all the insurance companies, and consider writing all lines of property insurance. Perhaps this will provide the financial stability to lower property insurance premiums?
The insurance industry are "cherry pickers"? Time to seriously start working on a program that protects the people.
I'm not a partisan voter. I attempt to research the person, but quite frankly both major parties are failing the people. 'Let's get back to basics?

Dear Governor Bush,

Nemours Children's Hospital will bring a highly specialized, pediatric focused, endowed institution to Central Florida. 

The services and programs of Nemours Children's Hospital will focus on the chronically ill patient providing services not currently offered in this region and establishing a location where medically complex pediatric conditions can be treated in a single facility with one seamless system of care. 

This institution will be located on a children's health care campus that will support research, physician and health care worker education, and advocacy programs for children. Nemours Children's Hospital will be an economic driver offering high wage, high skill jobs and it will support the development of the region as a worldwide destination for health care. 

The Nemours health care system will treat all children, regardless of their economic station in life, with no restrictions on the type of the breadth and depth of treatment. Simply put, what our children need, they will receive. 

*       Florida’s pediatric population is growing rapidly and 10-15% of the children born in any given year will need specialized pediatric care. Moreover, that percentage is on the rise. 

*       By 2030, Florida will have the third largest pediatric population in the country (source: U.S. Census Bureau.) Between 2000 and 2030, Florida will gain more than 2 million children. This large and growing population needs access to the specialized services that Nemours will offer. 

*       The number of children admitted to a hospital in Central Florida grew by 37% in the past five years, from 11,684 admissions to 16,029; however, the number of pediatric hospital beds shrank by 24% during that time, from 328 beds to 249 beds. (source: Health Council of East Central Florida)

*       Nemours has contributed more than $550 million to Central and North Florida since 1980 as evidence of its commitment to the children of Florida. 

*       There will be no fundraising or community contributions solicited to build this hospital. No tax dollars or government resources are required. 

*       Nemours has offered a gift to the Central Florida community that includes: 

*       $250-300 million capital investment in a top-tier children's hospital 

*       $30-40 million annual mission investment in a children's hospital (double the current mission investment in the existing Nemours Children's Clinic in Orlando) 

*       1,500 potential jobs with an economic impact of over $350 million in Central Florida 

*       Central Florida will have access to the Nemours Biomedical Research Program, ranked 13th in 2004 NIH funding among children’s hospitals. 

*       Today, there are presently 103 Nemours clinicians and 17 PhD lab heads involved in biomedical research programs. Those numbers would increase with a children’s hospital in Orlando. 

*       Nemours academicians produce almost 250 peer-reviewed contributions to journals, books and chapters annually. Nemours contributes several million dollars annually to the cost of the programs. 

Nemours children's health care system and hospital will serve as the catalyst for a broad-ranging advocacy program aimed at addressing issues affecting the quality of life and health status for children. Nemours will collaborate with other health care providers, community agencies, and related pediatric organizations to further pediatric advocacy. 

Governor, please demonstrate your leadership by processing the approval of the Nemours hospital.

Respectfully,

Jeb,

 

We need you to assist with the insurance and tax situation we find ourselves in.  Please help to take action

before you leave office.  

 

The tax situation is very difficult now, as we find ourselves facing the tax implications of several years of 

increasing home values.  Unfortunately, our local government spends or donates the healthy positive 

tax balance and is attempting to increase our real estate taxes.  What has happened to all of the net

increases realized with the tax basis skyrocketing for the last several years?  

 

Someone like me who owned a home for several years and paid a fair real estate tax bill in the $4k range,

find myself facing a 100% increase in taxes, as I recently built a new home.  The significant increase in

accessed values, along with the current millage, is causing alarm and impacting Florida families in a 

negative way.  No longer can I feel comfortable paying a long term tax bill which may approach $9 to $10k

per year.  Did I mention that this is in a rural area?  No County sewer, water, sidewalks, drainage etc. etc.

 

Please help Florida families, I believe a portability tax base would help.

Thanks,

Subject:	Please we need your attention: re: the loss of our beach home at Cape San Blas

Dear Governor Bush,
I know you must receive thousands of letters but I would greatly appreciate your reading mine and giving it some thought.
 
First of all you need to know just how much our family loves yours, your dad and mom, brother President Bush and his wife Laura and you as governor. We have supported and will continue to support you by contributions, many prayers and in positive words in defense when those with their "liberal agenda" have spoken.
 
My husband and I  live in the state of Georgia, are a middle aged, middle class family, with 3 dogs, 3 cats and the sweetest of daughters that just turned 3 years old.  I am teacher, and have been for 22 years and my husband has been in the automotive industry for just as long.  
 
In the year of 1999 we visited one of the most beautiful places we had ever seen, Cape San Blas.  We fell in love with its peaceful beauty and knew that this is where we wanted to retire.  We saved our money and were able to buy in the year 2001.  We have spent the most wonderful Thanksgivings, Christmases, summers and 4th of Julys there.  We have spent much love and time decorating our home, meeting and making lasting friendships, have walked on the beach holding hands talking about growing old there, have watched many gorgeous sunsets and have even excitedly told our daughter, Chloe' that "Some day this will belong to you". 
 
However, since we have owned our lovely home our Hurricane insurance has nearly tripled.  Our taxes have increased by over 50 % for such things as beach renourishment, which we were not allowed to vote on because we are not currantly fulltime Florida residents.  Is this legal to be taxed without representation?  How can we be taxed on something we were not able to vote on? Then this week were told, by our mortgage company, that a new requirement states that we will now need to pay for flood insurance.  Something we hadn't payed before because our home is not in flood zone.  The Cape San Blas area is not covered by FEMA flood insurance.  This year we will be paying approximately $18,000 just in taxes and insurance increases.
 
Coming upon retirement, and a fixed income, will mean that we will need to sell our lovely dream home.  It is with great sadness, that I cannot express, that we will be putting our home on the market, like so many of our neighbors and friends have already done.
 
I am not asking for anyone's sympathy, because we have always felt that we have been truly blessed to have owned such a beautiful home on such a beautiful beach.  And our family will always treasure our wonderful memories there.  I just wanted a listening ear and to help you be aware of these circumstances that are affecting so many wonderful people who,too, have dreamed of retiring in such a truly awesomely beautiful place.  
 
Thank you so much for your time,

September 26, 2006
 
Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to alert you to a matter that is of enormous concern to my company. International Medical Laboratory is a medical reference lab, founded by myself and my husband, a local Bradenton physician in 1980. Since that time, we have grown to an organization employing more than 70 people from your constituency. We are asking for your assistance as not only our growth, but even our continued survival, is now in jeopardy due to the short-sighted and misleading policies pursued by insurance carriers in our state.

The policy to which I refer is the contracting of lab services to a single provider. This is contrary to a free market practice and contrary to the best interest of the patient, for whom choice and competition can only improve the level of service they receive. Interestingly, this single provider restriction is not placed on any other ancillary service, such as radiology. The insurance providers claim the interests of the patients are served by the economic benefit. However, if the Any-Willing-Provider rules requiring payment of the contracted rate to any provider willing to accept that rate were passed then this economic benefit would still be passed along to the patient. Repeatedly, the large insurance carriers, Aetna, Cigna and even the locally based Universal Healthcare have denied us the opportunity to become providers, despite our accreditation from the College of American Pathologists, the highest standard of accreditation in the industry and our willingness to accept their rate.

The government insurances are now following suit. The Medicaid RFP desired to restrict the entire Medicaid patient population to a single lab provider. The Medicare Competitive bidding project also threatens to eliminate small providers. This "Winner-take-all" style bid also denies participation to providers whose bids are not low enough. Again, there is no cost savings in this. It simply reduces patient choice. The same "lowest bid" fee that is paid to the winners could be paid to all Medicare providers, as is done with the current fee schedule.

Because we have no recourse to demand payment from the insurance carriers when patients go "out-of-network" and the insurance companies refuse to let us "in" the network, we have been not only unable to grow, as we have in the past, but have had a 30% drop in business due in large part to the confusion among Medicare Part D patients. As Medicare patients who had long been accustomed to using our services were moved to Part D plans, they were not informed that they were restricted in their choice of lab providers nor were most even aware that their new plan replaced their Medicare coverage. Consequently, they continued to use our services stating they were still covered by Medicare and we performed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of testing for which we could not get reimbursed. The insurances felt they are not responsible for "out of network" charges and the patients feel they had been misled. Unfortunately, we are caught in the middle and remain unpaid.

Exclusive contracts between large national companies or even local ones are not in the best interest of patient care. Why should they be denied additional choices when we have the same accreditation and are willing to accept the same fees? We are a provider for United Healthcare and BlueCross/BlueShield. Yet restrictive and misleading programs, such as the "Hassle Free" local Medicare Part D Plan Universal Healthcare Medicare MasterPiece program have caused such disruption to physicians and patients, that our business is now in jeopardy. Piece by piece we have been restricted from doing business with one portion of our population after another - first HMO member, then PPO members with "exclusive contracts." Medicaid appeared to be next. Many Medicare members who moved to Medicare Part D were lost to us and now with the Competitive Bidding, traditional Medicare beneficiaries could be the final straw. 

We ask for your help in supporting legislation that would again level the playing field by allowing us to compete based on our merits and allow the patient to choose his provider based on the level of service he receives not on the arbitrary restrictions imposed by his insurance company.

I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about this matter at anytime. I can be reached at (800) 288-1465. 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor,
I would encourage you to call a special session to address this issue.  After talking with your assistants and the lawyers in the Department of Revenues I am convinced more than ever that a large portion of the problem is being caused by how the Department of Revenue is interpreting the law and is resulting in people paying tax on more than their property is worth.  

This I believe is in your control to change with a stroke of your pen.

I encourage to do whatever you can.  Your very successful tenure is drawing to an end, but people have the tendency to remember the last thing that you did or didn't do.  If these property tax bills go out at the levels that they are at now that will become your legacy.  Once you are gone everyone in Tallahassee will blame the guy that is no longer there to defend himself.

It will be a disaster here in Bay County.

I beg you to have a look at what is going on before it is too late.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am strongly encouraging you to hold a special session this week to find some solutions to the exorbitant increase of homeowner insurance policies in Florida.  My parents have State Farm Insurance and their premium has been doubled this year after an increase last year! They are retired and have a limited income.  They cannot afford a $3000.00 per year increase, with concern that premiums will continue to go up and up.
 
They are obviously not alone in this problem and the problem of not being able to afford these increases.  If something is not done soon a lot of people will leave Florida, not only the retired people but also middle class professionals.  Soon Florida will become a state of the very rich or the very poor.  The middle class will not be able to afford to live here.  Quite simply something must be done soon or things in Florida will seriously deteriorate for the middle class.  

Thank you for your support.

Mr. Bush - I am sure you have received overwhelming communication from the residents of Florida about the continuing property tax increases and insurance bailout premiums. As many of our retired and low to middle class residents get squeezed out of the State, the rest of us are astounded by the lack of government intervention on these matters. We have all heard the speeches and read the articles but there has been no clear action or relief for the limitless rate hikes being levied on this State’s residents as our leaders and insurance carriers remain profitable. I would like to know if you plan on doing anything about this situation immediately or if you will continue to allow the drain on communities to fund high local government salaries and Insurance Company Earnings Statements.

Thank you for supporting the need for a new hospital in western Port St Lucie. The city has been meeting with the hospitals and supports the need for the services out west. However, the hospital needs a con, certificate of need, which can only be issued by the state of Florida. The community needs to contact their state representatives such as Gayle Harrell, Joe Negron and Ken Pruitt. The city can not authorize the issuance of the con and the hospitals know that they have local support for this issue.

 

Thank you for taking the time to write. I appreciate your involvement and concerns. If I can ever be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.

Dear Governor Bush,
How long does Broward County have to wait for gambling, which we voted for over 18 months ago, to become a reality? I thought this was a democracy, but I guess I was wrong..The people voted but nothing has happened.  It is that simple.
Patience is a Virtue...But this is ridiculous.

Subject:	Property Taxes & Homeowners Insurance

Dear Governor Bush:

I am 53 years old, and  have worked in the Tampa Bay area for the past 21 years. I own a house in Pinellas County, and I am also building a new house. I have attempted to sell my house for the past year, but as you well know the housing marking has slowed down, way down.

Please address the problem of the high property tax increase when you sell one home in Florida and buy another. The high cost of my future property taxes may not allow me to retire in this state. 

Please start working on property tax portability now. 

The other issue is Homeowners Insurance, it is too high for the average homeowner. There must be an insurance pool or some other option for the state to help control these excess premiums. Just this past week I had a co-worker who receive a cancellation notice from Allstate Insurance. She must now pay a higher rate for reduced coverage.

Help the homeowners in Florida be able to stay in Florida!!

Sincerely,

Victor Routenberg

Subject:	Nemours Children's Hospital

I am writing as a concerned parent and citizen. I, along with my husband were born and raised here and Florida and like most in the Central Florida area have a child that was born at Arnold Hospital for Children and Women. My grandparents and parents alike have been to ORMC too many times to count. They are fantastic facilities. What concerns me is the fact that we have the opportunity to have a free state of the art children's hospital and we are not yelling and screaming with support. Nemours has not and will not ask for any money from the State, City, or County. It is completely funded through a trust set up from the duPont fortune. It is not trying to compete with anyone, APH, WPH, ORMC, or FL Hospital. Unfortunately there are plenty of sick and injured children to go around for everyone. The leaders of this community should be ashamed of not fighting for this wonderful opportunity. We will soon have a state of the art medical school, a research facility, and why not a children's hospital to compliment them both. It will not only over needed beds for sick children, it will offer more jobs for the area and a place for new physicians to train in specialized areas. I am asking that you, as our Governor, support this wonderful opportunity and encourage others to do so as well. It is not about politics, it is about the children.

Subject:	Property Tax Revolt

The Sunday edition of the Daily News had an article on Page I 1 entitled
Property Tax Revolt..  It mentioned "that if local governments continue
their reckless spending of property tax windfalls, voters may well be in
the mood to try potent remedies such as a Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, or
TABOR, which would require voter approval of all tax hikes".  I have
lived in Florida for 12 years and have seen my property taxes rise every
year.  Prior to moving to Florida, I have lived in 7 different states and
never saw a property tax increase.  In fact I was living in some states
that required  voter approval of all tax hikes which had to be passed by
the Legislature before the vote went to the people.  It is time that the
Florida Legislature adopt such measures as the local governments have
become greedy and will spend every cent that they can get their hands on
and to hell with how the voters feel.  Elaine Tucker on the Okaloosa
County Commission is a prime example of that mentality.  She was defeated
in this past election because of this and she still doesn't get it.

Subject:	Adjust existing Statutes to fix the property tax problem

I believe the problem is that taxpayers do not understand the property tax system and they do not act when they think things are going their way. The current lock-in crisis is nothing more than some of the Save Our Home Beneficiaries who have been telling snowbirds to stuff it, now complaining about the same property tax increases.
 
Adjust 200.065 to require Taxing Authorities tax communications [Notices, releases, etc.] contain the rolled back tax rate, the new tax rate, a change percentage, and a statement that the change is the result of their budget change. Put the burden on the TA's to tell their story with their facts, and make it obvious to the taxpayers they have an annual obligation in addition to paying the tax bill.
 
Adjust 193.155 by requiring the base SOH cap of 3%, to be reset every two years to maintain realism. The 3% is unrealistic when there is severe selling price inflation or deflation. Also, change the CPI from a single Florida standard, to local area standards for North, Central and South Florida. Between both changes, give the TA's a more realistic target for budget planning. 
 
If portability is on overwhelming political necessity, allow TA's to give portability exemptions that may be used only in their municipal jurisdiction. I do not think the sins of one TA ought to be ported to another TA.
 
I believe there is nothing wrong with a big tax increase or local exemptions if that is what the taxpayers want.

Governor Bush,
I'm sure you get thousands of e-mails about insurance and taxes but here's another one.  The current situation with property insurance and taxes is out of control.  I live in Broward county and it has become impossible to afford living here and there's no hope for retiring here.  Floridians are having to move out of state.  All this makes selling a house even harder.  I don't know who in their right mind would want to move to Florida to deal with the threat of hurricanes, extremely high (unaffordable) property insurance and taxes.  Something needs to be done and quick.  Why should I think the Charlie C. can fix this problem if you haven't been able to do it?  I hope you have time to do something about this before you leave office.  Thank you for your time.

Amendment drive seeks to add 'portability' to tax break
ORLANDO, (AP) -- Sept. 21, 2006 -- A county official who spearheaded a petition drive that gave homeowners a property tax break in 1992 announced plans Wednesday for another citizens initiative in 2008 to let taxpayers take that benefit with them if they move.
 
The proposal would add ''portability'' to the Florida Constitution's Save Our Homes amendment, said Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson of Fort Myers.
 
He announced the new initiative during a meeting of Gov. Jeb Bush's Property Tax Reform Committee. The panel's tasks include making recommendations on how to resolve inequities that have resulted from Save Our Homes.
 
The new initiative is intended to address one of those. Under the existing amendment, homeowners lose their tax break if they move. Many homeowners have complained they feel trapped in their old homes.
 
Several measures were introduced in the Legislature earlier this year to let homeowners take the tax break with them but none were approved.
 
''As the Florida Legislature has not come forth with a viable solution, we have written another citizens initiative, which will allow Florida homesteaders the portability of some of the Save Our Homes savings if they move within Florida,'' Wilkinson said in a statement.
 
The amendment now caps property tax increases for homeowners at 3 percent per year or the percentage that the Consumer Price Index has gone up, whichever is less.
 
The new proposal would allow a resident to apply the cap to a new home anywhere in Florida, but it would be limited to the percentage of the old house's market value represented by its taxable value.
 
That means if a homeowner pays tax on only half of the market value of his old home, he also would pay half on the new home. The tax break, however, could not exceed $400,000 of assessed value.
 
Save Our Homes Portability, a not-for-profit corporation, has been formed to gather more than 600,000 signatures needed to get the proposal on the ballot.
 
Its directors include state Sen. Burt Saunders, R-Naples, who introduced one of the legislative measures. He said he will try again next year. If lawmakers agree to put something on the ballot that is satisfactory, the petition drive could be discontinued.

I am a local and grew up in the neighborhood where I live now. Since last year my taxes have doubled and my insurance has increased by more than double. 
 
My parents can barely afford there insurance, it has almost tripled. That is the house that I grew up in.
 
We are all discussing leaving Florida, together because of how expensive it is to live here, now.  I just cant believe I can no longer live in the area where I was raised, and neither can my family.
 
Please help, all of us.
 
Thank you for your time.

Subject:	[*] HO INSURANCE, & TAXES

GOVERNOR BUSH,
 
As a Realtor for the past 20+ years, I am deeply concerned about the people that we are losing as Florida residents--both incoming, and outgoing.  This has been the most stressful year I can remember, and not just from the catastrophic weather of hurricanes,tornadoes, and floods.
 
The significant increases in homeowners insurance, taxes, and mortgage rates, have more than impacted sales not only in my own business, but thousands of others in Florida.  We are literally driving people who wish to relocate, and retire in Florida out of  lovely/affordable potential homes.  Retirees on fixed or limited incomes, are no longer able to purchase, and what is worse, they are leaving by the hundreds, relocating, where their families can assist them financially. This is seen ever more prominently.  Another major concern is that we are losing a great many Realtors who cannot survive in the ever changing real estate arena due to situations beyond their control .  
 
Is there anything that can be done so people who want to live in Florida feel unthreatened by these rapidly escalating costs?.  We are losing sales, difficult to even obtain in this down-turned market , as late as the closing table, due to unexpected costs associated with  home-owners insurance rates and tax increases.  These two components of the sale make closings impossible and  disappointing for all parties concerned.  
 
It is too late for legislation during your term of office, but Realtors throughout the state would encourage you to assist everyone  by  recognizing this problem and doing what is possible to work toward a solution to this serious issue.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Dear Jeb,
         We are having an insurance crisis throughout the state -- the beaches are hurting
most of all.  I know you are trying to help.  Gallagher has not come through for you.
The insurance companies need to be dealt with in a better manner.  
 
1)  Limit MOLD payouts or eliminate them to prevent fraud.
2)  Encourage competition in some manner -  I know you are trying.   
3)  Get mortgage companies to ease restrictions for those who want to self-insure,
     since it is cheaper to self insure -- particularly for some of the commercial properties
     on the beach and residential homeowners on the beach.
 
Tax Issue:  
 
 
PLEASE pass the bill to provide portability of homestead exemptions ------because all the
realtors are hurting due to sluggish sales.  This will definitely spur real estate activity
and will help the entire economy here in Florida and help the homeowner.
 
Just a few ideas,  since we really need to be creative to solve this crisis.  I realize that
you are trying to deal with this most important issue --   insurance.
Thank you,

Subject:	Homeowners Insurance and Property Taxes

Dear Mr. Bush:  
 
I am very concerned as to where our state is headed with the cost of Homeowners Insurance.  As Govenor and our leader, you need to take a stand against the insurance companies raising their rates excessively.  This is causing many homeowners to not be able to afford their homes anymore and either having to sell them or get foreclosed.  This is not making our state progress but it will start to impact our states' economy and our "way of life".   The insurance companies should not be able to have these unbelieveable rate increases, blaming it on our states hurricanes.  I am reading too many articles that the insurance industry is making record profits.  This in my opinion is unacceptable.  I recently read an article stating that the state of California's insurance commissioner is reversing rates for its citizens to the tune of 10%-22%, when in the same article it states the natural disasters that they face annually - earthquakes, fires, mudslides that cost lots of money to repair and replace.  I am very disturbed that my insurance rates are going up with Statefarm 33% and we live 50ft above sea level in a new 2 year old home in Pinellas county, Florida.  I have a neighbor who has the Citizens Insurance who's rates are going up to $22,000 per year.  While we live in an affluent golf course community in Palm Harbor, Florida, we are not on the waterfront.  Thankfully, personnally we can afford our insurance. What really disturbs me is when my sister - in - law who is an independent agent writing homeowners policy's tells me that properties in Pasco county that are barely worth $150,000 are paying $4000+ per year for homeowners policies.  These people definitely cannot afford this.  You must take a stand and get our Insurance Commissioner on the bandwagon to reverse the insurance companies running rough shot over the citizens of Florida.
 
Another issue that needs to be dealt with is the fact of our property taxes.  Since our market exploded over the past few years, many homeowners could not afford to make a move - up due the increase of their property insurance.  For example, a neighbor of mine that bought a home in Tarpon Springs, Florida prior to our move 2 years ago purchased their home in 1996 for approx $250,000.  With the save our homes etc. (which is a god send) their property taxes today are $6800.  Their home value is $500,000.  If, say they could afford a new home worth $600,000 and dump all the equity of their current property, they still cannot afford the home because the property taxes are now $12,000+ per year.  So, they just stay in their existing home and do not move up.  The economy does not see that gain because of this.  There needs to be a reform of our property taxes as well so that this impact does not occur when people move within Florida.
 
I have been a REPUBLICAN for several elections since I could vote and I am 45.  Unfortunately, with the current state of affairs will not be voting Republican this next term due to the above issues.
 
I thank you for hearing my opionion.

Even though you do not have much time left in office, I don't think you want to leave your legacy with Florida in the “worst crisis” it has ever been in.  Thanks to the cost of insurance and taxes, this is not a viable retirement State anymore.  I have been in the real estate business for a long time in New York and Florida. The insurance and taxes here are forcing people to leave or not relocate to Florida.  HELP!!!!

My name is Steve Allison, my address is 4648 Van Kleeck, New Smyrna Beach, Fl. 32169. Phone: 1-386-427-6431.  I would like to submit the letter below to you for consideration.  Thank you.
*******************************************************************
 

I have a plan for property tax reform for Florida that I would like to share:
 
1.) Roll back taxable property assessment values to 2002 levels.  To these values, add  cost-of-living increases for each year from 2002 to current year.  Then cap the new taxable property assessment value and only allow yearly cost-of-living increases.  One side effect of this, I would think, is that it would eliminate the need for the bulk of the County Property Appraisers budget, a savings to the taxpayers of Florida.
 
2.) Cap the millage rates for all municipalities at the October 1, 2006 level.
 
3.)  With items 1 and 2 mandated, the municipalities may go to the voters, by referendum, for any other millage increases they feel necessary for capital improvements or any other wants or needs.
 
4.)  Make this plan effective as of October 1, 2007.
 
This plan will force all municipalities to roll back their spending to a more acceptable and fiscally responsible level and allow the voters of the State of Florida to decide if and when they want to raise their taxes and exactly what those increased tax dollars will be spent on.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I went to the town meeting last night regarding our taxes in Ponce Inlet.  I am not homesteaded there, but have my primary residence in Winter Springs.  So I went to see what could be done about the taxes.  
 
My condo in Ponce Inlet is to go up to over $9500, with a 4.095 millage.  It's such an outrage.  I'm 63 and was hoping to retire there.  I also am a Realtor and have several listings in Ponce Inlet.  No one from our usual base (Ohio, Georgia, Orlando) is going to want to BUY real estate in that area any longer, with rates so high.  There are tons of condos just sitting for sale.
 
I suggest we find some kind of rollback to give some relief to the non-homsteaders.  And change the Homestead Act (revise, amend, whatever) to set a higher cap... 5% or 7% or something more than 3%.
 
We are going to price ourselves right out of the real estate market in Florida.  And I, for one, will have to find another state to retire to.  Please give me your thoughts.
 
I also know your daughter Noelle and send her my kindest regards.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
MayI first congratulate you on a great job almost done. I moved to Orlando from Brighton in England in November 2002. Just in time for my first full Summer to be Hurricane friendly! 
I was so impressed with the way you and your team handled everything. Most Government agencies everywhere seem to run around like headless chickens at times  like those, but you lead. Thank you.
 
I also wanted to point out a problem I have and its getting to be more of a bigger issue  as the years go by. I have forwarded an email I sent Orange County Property Appraiser Bill Donegan, who recently replied informing me again that there is nothing he can do.
 
In October 2002, I moved to Florida to set up my business (TV and Film Production Company) and purchased a home. I as many foreign business owners and tax payers, are here on the E2 Treaty Investor visa. I have invested almost $200,000 into my business and alot more into my home and living. In 2002/2003 my property tax bill was $3000. The following year it increased to $6900 a 126% increase. The following year it was raised to $8000 and now I have received my bill for 2007 and it has risen again to $10,000 p.a. I now have to sell the home and move, not sure where as all taxes are high and I have no protection from the massive property tax increases. In four years it has increased from $3000 p.a to $10,000 p.a!
 
This is due to the fact that only Greencard holders are considered permanent and receive Homestead. Now the E2 visa is valid for five years at a time. Once expired you can renew. As long as your business is employing Floridians and making an income. Some people I know have been here for Twenty years. I have been here for 4 years and plan to renew my E2 visa when it expires, pretty permanent and it my main home.
 
My E2 visa is not deemed by the State as a permanent visa. The E visa is the visa most Foeign business owners are issued and never transfers to a Greencard. Business Owners can be here forever if their Visas are renew each 5 years. This is my permanent primary home. But, the situation with property tax etc etc, is making it very difficult, expensive and really makes you feel very unwelcome. As I stated I am being forced out by these increases without any protection or benefits, such as your Safe Home grants. We pay the same taxes to the Fed and locally, sometimes more than neighbors. My neighbors pay $2000 to $2400 p.a property tax for similar or larger homes, I pay $10,000.
 
Please could you start an investigation into adding the E visas to the Homestead exemptions. The present restrictions are making my new life here in Florida very difficult and I know its there same for many other foreign business owners and tax payers.
 
Thank you again for your consideration and for your service.

Subject: Property Tax Increases

1005 E Ridgewood Street, Orlando. FL 32803
 
Dear Mr. Donegan
 
I previously contact you regarding the huge increases to my property tax. Property tax increased from $3000 to $6800 in 2004. In 2005 it increased from $6800 to $8000 and now for 2006 it will increase again from $8000 to around $10,000!!. I own only one property and you kindly explained before, why I was not eligible for Homestead. This was due to the fact I did not hold a Greencard.
 
I explained to you that nowadays you are only able to get a Greencard by marriage or by transferring to the USA from a foreign subsidiary, then after a year you are able to apply for a Greencard.
 
Most of the people from the U.K and elsewhere, that have emigrated here and are here legally on a E2 Treaty Investor visa. This Visa requires you invest over $100,000 (at risk) and transfer or start up a business here in the USA. This is a Visa that runs for up to 5 years at a time. At the end of which time can be renewed for a further 5 years, this visa is renewable ever 5 years. Some people as you may have read recently in the Orlando Sentinel have been here running their successful businesses, living and paying taxes, for up to 20 years. This Visa never transfers to a Greencard.
 
I am on this Visa and I have been here for 4 years now. I intend to renew for another 5 years shortly. 
 
When we previously spoke you stated that the Homestead rule was in place as to not encourage people to rent out homes. I stated that the 126% increase had forced me to rent out my home and rent somewhere less expensive, therefore going against your ideal.
 
I now feel I should tell you that these huge increases are now forcing me to sell my home to find somewhere in another County. I am being forced out of my own home by the huge increases without any protection at all. As I have stated I purchased the house in 2003 and paid $3000 in property tax. My neighbors in 2003 were and are still paying around $2000 to $2400, for bigger houses.  My property taxes are now close to $10,000 p.a.  For your information my property tax monthly payment is now almost as much as my mortgage payment. That's a huge increase to burden someone with, especially with the increase in the mortgage rate and the well published increases in property insurance. 
 
This really is a unfair situation and again I take it that the object was not to force Legal Immigrants out. Though I feel this is what will happen when so many small U.S business owners from the U.K and the rest of the World keep receiving these huge increases.
 
Please bear this in mind as you study the current Homestead exemptions. I truly believe that this will have a snowball effect,as I know for sure I am not the only person in this very difficult situation.
 
Thank you for you time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject:	Property tax issues in Florida

Dear Mr Bush,

As one of the approximately 1000 family's per day who are relocating to Florida, I am struck by the lack of common sense and objectivity I am seeing regarding Real estate property taxes in Florida.
It is my understanding that the median home price in Florida went from about $100,000 with a $25,000 homestead exemption to about $250,000 still with only a $25,000 exemption.
Simple math will show that tax income from property should be double to triple what it was 5 years ago.
Now somehow the government managed to function pretty darn good on that income 5 years ago.
So why is it that the tax rate cannot be reduced (they would certainly RAISE it if they needed more money).
Or the homestead exemption adjusted to be in proportion with the 1968 home values, when the exemption was put in place. Median home prices in 1968 were probably about $40,000. So raise the exemption to $175,000. 
There is much talk about "portability". That is one way to help out current homeowners, but why punish first time home buyers (our children and grandchildren) and the many people, like myself who want to move to Florida and spend the money they made up north in your state?
I own a business in Ohio, and will be bringing my higher than average earnings into Florida to "help keep Florida green"!
And there are thousands of others like me each week wanting to bring our hard earned money to Florida.
Is it fair or beneficial to create a dual tax structure to benefit one group and punish the others?
Or is it a setup for the class action and civil rights attorneys?

Dear Governor Bush:

My wife and I are voters and long-term residents of Palm Beach County and Florida. Along with many voting friends, neighbors and family, we are getting involved to do whatever it takes to get our ridiculously high property taxes reduced. Our government has allowed property taxes to get out totally of proportion with what people can afford – especially for citizens like us who moved recently, for small business owners and for out of state residents. The inequity between long term homesteaded residents and “the rest of us” is completely unfair since we all get the same services. And, worse yet, no one in government wants to take responsibility or seems to care about such an important issue that may really hurt our economy. 

It is time that you reduce and equalize our unbearable property tax burden. Why must you keep taxing and spending at a rate so much higher than inflation. Our population, and therefore our need for services, has not increased at anywhere near the rate of the total property tax revenue. Property values may have gone up in the last few years, but our average income has not gone up at nearly the same rate. So, we are literally being taxed out of our homes! 

For the first time in the history of our state, people are moving out because they cannot afford to own a home or a small business here. Upwardly mobile citizens can't afford to upgrade, because moving to a new home means paying astronomical property taxes. And, retirees and other people from out of state are thinking twice about buying property here for that same reason. This hurts real estate, development and all its related industries that are very important to our state’s economy. Our leaders seem to not care about the fact that this negative economic impact will trickle down and affect everyone. 

Under our present government’s watch, our hard earned money is increasingly being taxed away, our homes have become financial burdens and our economy will be negatively impacted. You must act now - not to keep property taxes where they are - but to REDUCE them. And please, equalize the tax burden for ALL THE PEOPLE. It is so unfair that some of us are paying up to 6 or 7 times what our neighbors pay for equally valued property.

We bought our home in 1999 for $80,000. At that time, we had one child, and a small three bedroom home was adequate. Now we have three children and we need a larger home. After much research and number crunching, I have determined that I can afford to pay the higher principle and interest payments as well as the higher insurance for the larger home. When I factor in the fact that I will have to pay an additional $500 per month in property taxes, however, I am forced to abandon all hopes of building a larger home for my family.

 

I hope you see where I am going with this. 

 

I know that there are countless other Floridians that are facing the same situation that I am. Revising the "Save Our Homes" law to allow families to move within the state (or even within the county) without having to pay huge increases on their property taxes is without a doubt the most important issue that you could address (in my humble opinion of course). This issue may not seem as important as laws regarding stem cell research or oil drilling in the Gulf, but unlike those issues, this one would have an immediate direct impact on the lives of Floridians. In addition to allowing Floridians to move within the state, this law would have the added bonus of boosting residential construction and stimulating Florida's economy in general. 

 I know that I am not telling you anything that you do not already know. I am just trying to make my voice heard and hope that someone pays attention.

I thank you graciously for your time and I hope that you will give the priority to this issue that it deserves.

 

Sincerely,
James R. Paquette

Dear Governor Bush,

 

First, I want to thank you for your service to the state of Florida.  I think you’ve done about as well as it’s possible to do, and a lot of us appreciate your work deeply.  ATTABOY!

 

Except for one little thing:  insurance.

 

Most of the letters you’re getting, I’m sure, are about property insurance rates, and no doubt they’re ridiculous and cry out for reform.  While you’re at the insurance issue, I urge you to look into a similar comprehensive reform of workers comp.  There is no good reason for workers comp on a carpenter to be 40%, or a roofer 60%.  It’s been a big problem for decades, and with all the other pressure on new construction costs it may be the best place to cut some costs and bring affordability back to home building.

 

Please keep in mind your conservative principals, and seek diligently for free market small government solutions to these problems – don’t just pile on more restrictions and regulations.

 

Thanks again,

Peter B. Thorp

HELP US!!!  It's not doing me any good as a Lic. Professional Realtor  
trying to make ends meet. People are being forced to sell, because  
they can't fit the increases into their fixed budget.  We pay $11,000  
year in taxes on our homesteaded property.  Plus we have a 2nd home  
(Investment property) We want to move out of Florida.  Our homeowners  
insurance(Nationwide) is dropping us Nov. 2006.  Now what, we are  
being forced into higher premiums.  You mind as well bend us over  
without the Vaseline!

California home owners basically pay approx. 1% of market value,  In  
Florida we pay approx. 1.7%.  That's almost double.  Someone is  
making money, and we don't see any extra services the city is  
providing us.  Where we live, the city doesn't even RECYCLE.  WHY?  I  
did in CA.  We had more recycle than  garbage.

I would love to serve on some board the help service our citizens.   
Maybe a lobbyist!  You just let me know were I can go to help YOU

To Whom It May Concern:
 
I was born and raised in Clw have same with my parents. I don't understand how you can raise taxes on the homes like you do. Example have a house owned it for 12years taxes were 2500.00 before I bought another home, which I moved my homestead to the house I live in because that's what you do. Well even though I still own the home and have done nothing to it nor has any improvements been done on the street my taxes went to 5000.00 now to 6500.00 within 2yrs this is the old home which I rent out, but might return to one day. How can the taxes keep getting raised even though I still own it and nothing has been done to the property. I can understand if I sold the property and made money. Than the taxes go up to the value of the home that makes since. But I feel the people who want to purchase a home and live here should have a flexiable tax other than the out side investors.

 Mr Bush
 
I have moved from South Dakota 5+ years ago.  My taxes in my first house I bought in Clearwater have went from $600 - $2900 in less than 4 years, I am trying to keep this house as a rental but am posible going to have to sell it.  My other house that I live in now taxes went from $1,100 to $2900 and the insurance is up to $3100.  This means that I am at $500 a month for T&I.  This is alot considering I payed just $77,000.  This needs to be addressed.  
 
All Insurace needs to be addressed.  I am 35 years old and am paying $700+ a month in Car, health and homeowners insurance.  
 
Why is it that when I go to the doctor the price is different if I am paying cash, have Blue cross, or mutual of omaha.  Everybody is getting riped off.  The doctor are fixing you with profit in mind because insurance(malpractice and collecting from the insurance) is in the back of their mind. 
 
The insurance companys are also making you pay your deductibe then they go and negotiate the bill and they are paying less that the customer when you are on a 20/80 co pay.
 
Bottom line --------Taxes are going out of control and insurance are ripping everybody off.

Subject:	Real Estate Tax Hurricane may make Florida small businessl areas into GHOST TOWNS

Dear Governor Bush,

A collision of the real estate bubble with the Florida SOH restrictions is 
about to result in a major crises in our State's local commerce.

I attended a City Council meeting in Punta Gorda, tonight, and heard several 
local business folks report that their real estate taxes are increasing by 
hundreds of percent. Some reported that they are simply unable to pay these 
taxes.

The city manager reported that this problem exists throughout Florida.

We need your timely assistance in solving this problem before these 
businesses are shuttered,  jobs are lost and our small commercial areas are 
possibly put into a state of blight.

I'm not sure of the solution to this problem. One speaker suggested a 10% 
cap on the dollar amount of such tax increases because it may be practical 
to plan for such increases.. Others think that the appraisal process needs 
to be done differently to result in more realistic valuations but the 
appraisal people don't have that flexability. There is concern that the 
county (Charlotte) is becoming spendthrift and perhaps a restriction on 
county budgets and school board budgets is needed. Our City Council, which 
has done a decent job of managing it's budget, is powerless to solve this 
problem. They believe that the only body that has the power to solve this 
problem is the government of the State of Florida.

Since these tax increases and the consequences are imminent, I request that 
you address this problem as your top priority.

New Florida residents are also in for real estate tax sticker shock. 
Something needs to be done to protect them, as well.

Thank you, in advance, for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely

Subject:	Property tax - excessive increases

Governor Jeb Bush
Dear Sir:
I have lived in Broward County since 1992. In Aug 2004 , I purchased a retirement property (for my wife and horses) in Citrus County. It's less than  10ac. with a 36yr old mobile. 
My taxes there, have increased 400% to date. I have done no improvements, and the county has not either. They haven't even done any maintenance on the poor quality dirt roads.
I had hoped to be able to move to this property in 12 years when I can retire from my job in Miami. The way its going, I don't know if I will be able to hold onto it. I am working more now and have less spendable income.
This level taxation is outrageous, and needs to be fixed soon.
We need a way to make our homestead portable and retain the homestead value "banked" in our current residence. There should also be some extension of homestead which would apply to a second retirement type property as I described above.
As a minimum, there needs to be a cap on the allowable property tax increase year over year. Homestead cap is 3%, why not set 5% cap for non-homestead? This new benefit should be structured to aid the Florida resident and not something speculators and big land investors can exploit. Feel free to tax them to the full extent.
I would like to see this fixed and made retroactive to 05.
Fixing this, would go along way to helping revive the real-estate market and allow people who are now trapped in their homes the opportunity to move to meet their needs.
What will it take to make this happen? What can I do? 
I will also send a copy of this to the Attorney General. I did see an add of his which mentioned doubling of the 25k exemption -- that is not sufficient.
Thank you for your time and assistance.
Sincerely,
Darrell DeWitt

Subject:	Insurance & tax problems in Florida

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
As everyone is aware, these 2 issues are of major concern.  Not only do I reside here, but I am also a REALTOR & Mortgage Broker in this state.
 
Let me address personal issues first.  I came to Florida 17 years ago becuase I could not afford a home in NY or NJ.  At that time, I purchased a new 3/2/2 fully completed home for under 90,000.00 (in Palm Harbor).  I believe my taxes were about 400.00 per year & insurance was less than 600.00 per year.  My auto insurance was also very low (about 7-800.00 per year).
 
I moved to a very large home in a gated community in Hernando County.  Two years ago, I realized that I needed to down size & built outside the deed restricted areas.  I was lucky to be able to pay cash for my new home & felt a sense of relief.  However, that quickly diminished with the skyrocketing insurance & taxes.  I am now paying 2200.00 per year in taxes & my 800.00 / year insurance policy is being canceled in October when it is time to renew.  The insurance co. sent me a letter stating that they no longer use the agent that I an with (Nationwide).  I called the agent who said that the information is not true but that the company is pulling out of Hernando County.  My only option is Citizens for 2300.00 per year.
So now, I have downsized to be debt free & less strapped financially, only to find that I will incur 4500.00 per year in expenses just for the priveledge of owning my home.  This is outrageous.  I am opting not to have any insurance, as I cannot afford it.
Now, couple this with the low salaries in this state.  Something MUST change. Also, my auto insurance is now 1700.00 per year, another rediculous situation.
 
The insurance co. had no valid reason for canceling my policy, yet the government allows them to do so.  What is going on in this country.
 
Now, as a REALTOR & a resident of this state, I can tell you that we need a dramatic change & we need it fast.  Don't you realize that a large, significant number of people will lose their homes this year due to the inability to pay their bills?  Again, we do not generate the salaries in this state to meet the demands of our everyday expenses.
 
People are moving out of Florida because they can no longer afford to live hear.  There will soon be no attraction for people to move here.  Things need to change.
 
Please take this letter seriously & act upon it.  The future of our state & it's citizens are at stake.
 
Truly,

Subject:	Why I left FL.

Mr. Bush,

I was a resident of FL for 16 years, the last 7 in Oldsmar.  Over the past
3-4 years my property taxes, homeowners insurance, and flood insurance had
all risen dramatically.  This rise added hundreds of dollars per month
premiums and at last count was over $2000 per year higher annually over the
3-4 year period.  The financial burden was too much, as well as the stress
it caused for my wife and I while trying to raise our children.  We put a
For Sale sign in the yard right before the market slow down, priced it
right, sold in one day.

I additionally own several town homes in Clearwater as rental properties,
and had visions of turning one into our retirement home.    The same
insurance and property tax increases are now effecting my ability to manage
the rental income to cover mortgages, rising taxes, and the necessary
insurances.  Frankly, I don't know if owning property in Florida is a good
decision anymore.  I am contemplating what to do with these properties now,
and that is why I am writing you.

If you, and our government doesn't fix these rising costs, I can only
believe that your going to lose more residents and possible push the states
retirement community to higher ground.

My family calls North Carolina home and we love it, but we do miss Florida.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Recent events require me to write this letter. I recently added my wife to the deed on our house in Satellite Beach. This in turn has done several things. One due to the fact that we are not married in the eyes of the state Of Florida. Reason being she is uninsurable due to her melanoma cancer history. She has to stay on Medicare to pay for her medical bills. If we got married this would end. The above has caused us to loose our homestead exemption and our taxes have doubled from $2,700.00 a year to $4,800.00 a year. I thought that taxes could not increase more than 3%. I know the value of our house has increased but did not know even though no money had transferred the taxes would increase.
 
Your help, if you can help would be appreciated.

Subject:	[*] Please help 830,000 homeowners

Dear Gov. Bush:

Under your administration a program was developed to help Manufactured Home owners guard against storms, by insuring their tie-downs were up to code. This program has just been refunded with 7.5 more millions of dollars. The bill is called the Residential Construction Mitigation Program (RCMP) and is greatly needed.

In July a senate bill #1980 (Enhancement Program) intends to do even more for the hardening of the 830,000 manufactured homes in Fl. This also is much need and of great value for the safety of our Fl. residents. (Thank You Very Much) 

 The DCA sent me some documents regarding SB#1980, the documents states that (This bill is a grant program that ensures that entire manufactured home communities and mobile home parks may be improved.) A great deal of money for both bills has been awarded to Tallahassee Community College (TCC) to administer the grants

Yet someone, I assume at TCC has decided that all these millions of dollars be used  

for only about 10% (not the entire) of all the Manufactures Home owners in Fl. The other 90% according to a letter I received for an Amy Bajoczky of TCC at 1-850-201-8025; Fax 850-201-8518; BAJOCZKA@TCC.FL.EDU will be precluded because we all have enhanced our homes with masonry or block skirting. This was not the intent of the legislators.

I contacted Ms Bajoczky and ask if the intent was to precluded all masonry or block skirting homes from Bill #1980 also? Her reply was emailing me an application for that grant. What is the big secret? Is some body hiding where all this excess money is going? It certainly is not going to be spent on helping us out, we all have been precluded.. 

Two questions if you please:

1.	If the majority of homeowners are to be precluded because of funding, why not address that problem. Instead of just taking the path of least resistance and letting both grants FAIL?  
2.	Millions of taxpayers dollars have been funded for these two much needed grants. What happens to all the excess money if only a small percentage of homes are not precluded for these grants? Is it just going to be used up by factious accountability?    Please help; Please advise. Something is wrong.

On 9/05 and again on 9/13/06 I attempted to seek your help in gaining information regarding these grants. As I understand it both are under the managed by the Dept. of Community Affairs. I contacted that dept and received the following reply. (I am not familiar with the administration of the current funding for the mobile home communities)      (who is??)

On 9/20/06 as a result of your receipt of my 9/13 email. My question was past down lower and lower until I received a call from the Planning Manager Division of Emergency Management Bureau of Recovery and Mitigation Residential Construction Mitigation Program. Who again replied (the contract between Tallahassee Community College (TCC) and the Residential Construction Mitigation Program(RCMP) expired on June 30th.) How then is watching the store? This had nothing to do with my questions and concerns. Both statements had very little or no value, except to dump me off. Please if the Governors office is not interested in helping me with these questions regarding Millions of tax payers dollars and the concerns of 830,000 homeowners, tell me yourself. 

Dumping me off should be beneath you. We need your help.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a conservative and supporter of both you and President Bush. I am truly frightened of the time when the two of you are out of office...
 
My husband is a letter carrier for the USPS and I am a hairdresser. I have been a Florida resident all but nine years of my life. My husband has been a resident of Florida for ten years. At the age of fifty-six, I have always expected to retire here. That now seems to be the impossible dream due to the exorbitant rates of taxes and insurance. Though my husband has a decent retirement plan, we will not be able to pay our mortgage payment, taxes and insurance, and still have money to live on. We will have to join the exodus out of Florida.
 
This is a problem with no easy solutions. How can a democracy tell an industry they cannot charge whatever they want for their product? Yet something has to be done... We are praying for you that a solution can be found while you are in office.
 
God be with you always.

Dear Governor,
Please help! I was recently divorced and a large portion of my alimony was based on the rental properties I received in our divorce settlement, but instead of an asset it have created a horrible deficit for me. I can barely make ends meet because of the taxes and insurance that have overwhelmed me. I have been forced to put the properties up for sale and with the real-estate the way it is, it is a horrible loss to not only me but my children. The rental property was to be my retirement and supplement my income. I can barely make ends meet. I feel that I am being forced , like so many others out of the state I have lived all my life. I have been forced to drop my health insurance and at my age I will never be able to obtain more. My Home owner insurance has doubled, taxes have risen. Please help our citizens.

Hello Jeb
  
   I write because I do not understand. I put my faith in my leaders but have become very disappointed in were that has gotten my family, and fello neighbors.
  
  I am sure by now you have heard everyone complain about this subject. 
  I am here to give answers to the problem, along with my complaint. 
 
  Every one of authority usually responds with, its complicated and not simple to fix. But doing nothing is no fix either. We have to act now with emergency legislation and yes, toes will get stepped on. So what, its either that or stand by and watch while Floridas economy collapses into ruin. I have lived in Pensacola most of my life. Never have I seen locals moving out like this. They aren't going far, just 10 miles down the road into Alabama. Into Lillian, Orange Bch, and Seminole, these areas suffered as much as we in the storms. But Alabama residents can get reasonable insurance and property taxes are inexpensive there.
I propose to implement immediate legislation that would require insurance companies to first write and have available for sale in all areas of Florida commercial building and homeowner policys. Insurers will no longer be allowed to write any type of insurance otherwise. This will accomplish two things it will bring some back into the business spreading the insureds pool over more insurers and it will increase revenues of the insurers with all other types of policys gained from the insurers who do not wish to do business Floridas way. This is a logical and workable solution to the insuance problem. Yes it will piss some off but it will help the people and lessen the risk to the insurers who wish to participate. 
 
  As for property tax I have personally experienced a 250% property tax assessment increase in a single year. This increase is not based on any improvements it is based solely on the land value. This ought to be illegal. I feel I am being bullied for my lunch money. I do not mind paying a fair share but a 250% increase in a single year is flat out extortion. I live on S.E. Baublits Dr. in Pensacola, this has been done to every piece of property on this street. I have heard local talk show talking about this going on all over Pensacola. What on earth is our local government doing.
I helped you on one, now can you help us on this one.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Everyone seems to be talking about giving more relief to the "homesteaders" on their taxes but I don't hear anyone talking about the businesses or the rental properties.  There has got to be some relief for the businesses or they will begin to leave the state.  Also, it is not fair to the long term (1 years or more) renters who get no relief because the taxes keep going up for the owner who then passes it on to the renter.  
 
I am a landlord and I have had to pass on tax raises to my long term tenant which I am not happy about.  They are a struggling young couple who cannot afford to buy a home and very soon will not be able to afford to rent an apartment.
 
Unfortunately, I cannot afford to absorb the raises in order to keep these very nice, responsible people in my unit.  Can't some sort of homestead relief be given to landlords who rent to long term tenants?
 
I admit that I don't have the answers to any of the tax problems but please do not forget the landlords and businesses when your committee considers solutions.
 
Thank you,

I doubt if you can straighten it out before then but if you could at least give it a try. A little vision and foresight on these issues during your 8 year term would have been nice. Instead we end up with a badly mismanaged citizens insurance company and one of the most unfair property tax systems both of which  prevent families from realizing there dream of home ownership.

Dear Gov. Bush, 
    I am adding my opinion to the heap you have on your desk at the moment regarding property taxes.  I know the crush taxes have made on the real estate market and it is long past doing something about it.  Since there are so many cities and municipalities in this state with their own millage rates, the solution must come from the state level to remedy this situation.   I suggest that the exemption be raised from  $25,000 to $100,000 of appraised value of the home, now that the average home here in Florida is around $250,000.  When our purchase prices were in the $30k-$100K for the nicest homes, the millage rates made good sense....the state has certainly had a windfall with the amount of taxes being paid to date...    Florida residents should be able to buy "up" and carry over  the 3% cap to their new house as well.  There is a leveling off in the pricing of the market now fueled by the hipe of the media that pounded the "bubble" idea until they have people believing it.   it is a regional situation and not a national one as far as I can see.  Back to Florida, however, where it was a place for seniors to retire (who are going else where because they don't want to pay the taxes or insurance rates) and a place where families can raise their children in a pleasant  climate.   My suggestion is a simple one, and maybe a "bandaid" for the cause but it is a far better idea that the ones I hear from the candidates....we are losing our patience with  elected officials that say one thing and get into office and do nothing but draw their salary until they are unseated or get too old to think and too lazy to move their behinds to get anything done.  
    Please consider this letter as a sincere effort to help solve this critical problem.

Importance:	High

Dear Governor:
It's embarrassing to the state of Florida for many events, such as the Voting Poles, to
water safety conditions, our highly toxic waste dump that is dormant in Tarpon Springs and causing cancer daily, to elderly people that can re-apply for driving licenses when already gone BLIND, and now to the fact that my, and everyone else's, insurance has
gone up 300% in just a couple years.  It's CRIMINAL.  Unethical.
And, to know that our politicians are taking money from CITIZENS Insurance
and doing nothing.  Citizens Insurance  is NOT in the red, and is a conspiracy of up-rising
costs.
I will NOT put up with it.  Nor will the other 50,000 realtors that see the decline
in our state of the middle class moving elsewhere where it's more reasonable to live.
We are NOT California.  
I protest and want answers to why there's no law to stop the insurance conspiracy
in the state of Florida.  And, I do NOT want to hear about the hurricanes that
passed thru recently as there was plenty of money allotted for disasters.
I want answers, we all want answers,
and will write you daily till we get them.
We've passed an email thru-out the entire Tampa Bay area, sending plenty of letters
your way - and hopefully you'll leave office helping us, instead of destroying the citizens here that own property.  It's a win win situation for you, and for US.
Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] Homeowners Insurance and Taxes

Dear Mr Bush,
I am writing to you with regard to our dilemma with Insurance and Taxes.  We just purchased a new home with the intention of living her forever.  However after making it the home we always dreamed of we now have to sell it as we can't afford the $21,000 per year to cover insurance and taxes.  I know you're probably thinking we've over extended ourselves, at the outset this was not the case.  We are now struggling with equity loans and credit card debt just to cover our expenses and avoid foreclosure.
This is wrong, this is our home.  We did not ask for exorbitant insurance hikes and impossible taxes.  This is a major crises.  We are planning on getting OUT...., OUT OF FLORIDA, OUT OF THE US....unless something changes.  
We are praying each day for a reprive, foreclosure looms as does bankrupcy.  HELP US... WE ARE US CITIZENS, GOOD TAX PAYING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.  
We are doing our part, please do yours.
This is your opportunity to make your mark on Florida legislation and give us, the working middle class a chance.
Yours truly,
Ann McKirdy

This is in regards to the mass exodus that is happening in Florida that 
is happening everyday. There has never been this many properties for 
sale in Florida. Statistics have proven in the past that 1000 people are 
moving to Florida everyday.  However that has all come to a screeching 
halt.  Why? well ,being a real estate investor and a Realtor I can tell 
you why.  Florida is pricing itself out of the market,  retired people 
on fixed incomes, first time home buyers, or any potential transplants 
looking at Florida are looking elsewhere for affordability..  As 
construction costs have risen there is only so much that can be changed. As 
we all know the 2 biggest problems that we face are real estate taxes 
and homeowners insurance.  The Portability tax idea I a possible 
salvation.  It has gotten to the point people can't afford to move because 
their taxes would double.  It hardly seems fair that one house can be 
paying $5000 in taxes and a similar house next door that was recently 
purchased is paying $9000 for the same house.  The insurance is way 
out of control as cancellation notices are now the norm.  I have 
personally been cancelled on my primary residence as well as 2 of my investment 
properties and am  in a panic looking for something affordable.  
Florida's government must create a program ASAP to offer some kind of 
subsidized insurance to homes that are inland.  It is not fair for homes that 
are 45 miles inland to be pooled together and placed in Citizens 
Insurance.  As a realtor I see and talk to people everyday and they are 
leaving Florida for Georgia, North Carolina and back to the Northeast.  If 
we can't do something to make insurance affordable and lower real estate 
taxes , Florida's population is going to plummet.  What are your 
thoughts on these issues?

Subject:	Homestead Exemption

I bought a home in Florida in 2001 as my only resident. For 5 years I never received a tax bill as the mortgage company received the original. My copy was sent to an unknown address in West Virginia. My house payment was going up every year and I thought this was due to insurance. I even refinanced my house in 2004, but the payments kept going up. I found out about the Homestead about a year ago and was told that I should have it since I live in Florida, but I was never told I had to apply. About 2 months ago I found that I have never had the Homestead, so I petitioned for 2006 and applied for 2007. I also had the address changed, but was told I can not do anything for the previous years. The address mistake was made by the appraiser’s office. The Tax Collector’s office still has the wrong address and I have been told by a WV postal supervisor that I can not even get this mail forward to me since the address does not exists.

 

There seems to be an injustice because if I owed this money to the state, then I would be responsible for any back taxes. However, because the county makes a mistake; I am just out-of-luck. It seems that there is very little advertisement on the Homestead Exemption in Florida and up to the home owner to learn. I have worked and lived in Citrus County for the last five years and have been a registered voter since 2001.

 

My question, is there anything I can do to get this corrected to 2001? I can not afford the house if my taxes are not reduced ASAP.

 

Thanks,

Subject:	SAVE OUR HOME TAX LAW PROBLEM

DEAR GOVERNOR ,
AS YOU WELL KNOW THE SPECIAL AMENDMENTS THAT WERE VOTED ON AND ADDED TO OUR LAW ARE A HEAD ACHE . THAT INCLUDED THE BULLET TRAIN FOR SOUTH FLORIDA, THE CLASS SIZE AMENDMENT  AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE SAVE OUR HOMES AMENDMENT. I ADMIT I ALSO VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE ABOVE AMENDMENTS AND I AM TRULY SORRY. I DID FINALLY VOTE TO REPEAL THE BULLET TRAIN AFTER I UNDERSTOOD THE COST TO THE TAX PAYER. THAT IS ALSO THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE OTHER TO AMENDMENTS. NO ONE UNDERSTOOD THE COST OF THEM. IF THE VOTERS HAD UNDERSTOOD THE COST WE WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED FOR THEM. IF GIVEN THE TRUE COST WE WOULD VOTE TO REPEAL THEM.
 
FLORIDA IS FACING A MAJOR TRAIN WRECK BECAUSE OF SAVE OUR HOMES TAX LAW. WE HAVE HAD HURRICANES, HAD INSURANCE DOUBLE IF YOU CAN GET IT, AND HUGE TAXES FOR ALL PROPERTY NOT PROTECTED BY SAVE OR HOMES LAW. WE GAVE SOME TAX PAYERS A BREAK AND PUT  THE BURDEN ON OTHERS.
 SECOND HOMES, RENTAL HOMES AND BUSINESS HAVE BEEN HIT WITH 100% INCREASE IN TAXES. NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO SELL UNDER THE CURRENT AND FUTURE CONDITIONS. BUYERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET A MORTGAGE OR THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THE TAXES. THE TAXES IN SOME CASES NOW ARE HIGHER THAT THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS! THOSE WHO OWN RENTAL PROPERTY WILL HAVE TO PASS INCREASE ON TO RENTERS WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE RENT.
 
PLEASE FIX THE CURRENT LAW BEFORE THERE ARE BANKRUPTCIES EVERY WHERE. INFORM THE VOTERS AND LET US REPEAL IT LIKE WE DID THE TRAIN. IF YOU TELL VOTERS THE TRUE COST OF CLASS SIZE WE WILL REPEAL IT ALSO.
 
CALIFORNIA PASSED A LAW THAT SIMPLY SAID NO ONE'S PROPERTY TAXES COULD GO UP MORE THAN 3% PER YEAR. WE NEED USER FEES OR IMPACT FEES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT OR USE A SERVICE. NEW CONSTRUCTION SHOULD PAY FOR NEW SEWERS AND NEW ROADS.

I don't know what the city and state levels are doing with the overabundance source of monies derived from the taxes here lately.  I am unfortunately sure that by the time the uppers address this issue that the money will have already been spent.  As far as the homeowners insurance problem what the heck is going on.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I think the issue of homeowners insurance & property taxes is out of control.  As a citizen, business person, and homeowner, I am disgusted that we have become a state where it is now unaffordable to buy a home and live.  Retirement in Florida is no longer affordable to most people who dreamed of it for years.  It is a travesty that nothing has been done about this situation.  What is going to happen when the foreclosures begin?  It will not be a positive legacy to your administration.

Dear Jeb,

I am a Realtor in Pinellas County and have seen the impact the insurance and tax crisis has on our industry. First Time Homebuyers cannot afford to buy a home because the taxes and insurance are as much as the principle & interest payment. Our teachers, police officers, fire fighters ect. cannot afford to live here anymore. The decent rentals are expensive due to the owners charging more for rent because of the extra expense of the taxes and Insurance to them. Most of the sellers I have are moving out of our state because of this issue. Out of state buyers hear nothing about Florida except for our Tax and Insurance problems and that hinders them from buying. People are losing their homes at record number because of the Insurance and taxes. Florida is not affordable for most people anymore. The average salaries for workers here do not afford the American Dream anymore. Something must be done quickly. This crisis has a "trickle down" effect and is hurting many many people.

Subject:	[*] property tax reform

I would very much have liked to gone to the meeting in Orlando on Property taxes but when I heard about it, it was too late for me to change my plans so I you would please forward this to your committee considering property tax reform.

    If any tax in this country is in need of reform it is our property tax system.  It is not based on ones ability to pay.  It is not based on the purchase price of the property.  It is not based on any income the porperty may or may not generate.
    48 percent of seniors are in fear of having to give up their homes because of property taxes and this doesn't take into consideration those of us whose lifes change due to circumstances beyond our control such as disability or the lose of life of ones spouce.  While I agree taxes are an evil necesity, no one shoud have to be forced out of their home solely on the fact they can no longer aford the property taxes on it.  What benefit is it to the state or counties when seniors or anyone else has to sell their home and then moves into a trailer or government subsidized low income housing.  How many of you are sure that you have enough life insurance to cover all future expenses to your family if you are killed in an accident on your way home tonight.  My father was one of those people who was forced to sell because he had a major heart attack at 59.  Now who benifited by his having to sell his home.  I may find myself in that same situation.  I was disabled in a vehicle accident several years ago.  The person at fault was a 16 year old boy who was allowed by our legal system to file bankruptcy.  I received all of $9000 from his family of which my attorney took 30%.  I have had 7 surgeries and over $500,000 in medical bills not taking into account all the perscriptions I take.  Can you please tell me why I should ever be forced to sell because of property taxes.
    If property taxes can not be eliminated all together I would propose that no one should have to pay more then 5% of their adjusted gross income for the property taxes on their primary home.  I know that some people have 2 or more homes and by making this exemption only on their primary home it would help eliminate abuse.

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

I am curious as to why the homestead exemption amount has not been raised from $25,000.00 to a reasonable amount to adjust for the increase in property value.  I was under the impression that our constitution provides for the exemption to keep up with the cost of living.  Raising the exemption amount would certainly bring welcome relief to Florida property owners and business owners.  I am not even going to address the insurance issue at this point.  I am sure you are aware of the low wages and high cost of living in Florida, specifically, in southeast Florida.  We must address these issues now and not later.  I have not heard anything solid from your office or any of the candidates with regard to resolving these issues.  No one wants to commit to resolving the issues at hand.  I am certain that I am not the only person who feels that our local government is not giving the community straight answers.   

 

In my line of work, I have noticed that most of our closings lately, if any, are persons moving out of the state.  If this is our future, it seems very bleak.  I now these issues have resolve.  I am hoping that all of the talk will stop and Florida’s elected officials will take action.

Please get control of the property taxes and Home owners insurance in this 
state of Florida.  I am a realtor in this state and my livelihood has been 
severely effected because of these two issues, let alone my customers who 
suffering and are forced to downsize if not move completely out of the

the extreme wealthy and then the service industry to serve the wealthy!  But 
the service industry sector will not be able to afford their own housing and 
will have to rent, never realizing the American dream of owning their own 
home.

Thank you for making one last great change before you move on from office.  
Remember life is the legacy that you leave behind when our final day 
arrives...

... and as always, Create a great moment, right now and make a change, for 
all those people that you represent in this great state!

Mr. Bush: Property taxes are really getting out of hand and I hope you can address the issue before you leave office.  I have had some land that I own without a homestead on it go up 35% on top of 20% last year.  I am nearing retirement and I don’t see how I will be able to hang onto any of it due to taxes vs my retirement income.  On the other hand when I try to sell some of it, the buyers ask about taxes and the next thing you know they are unable to buy because of taxes.  I want to buy a second home now but taxes keep on holding me back.  Could I suggest a cap for people of retirement age?  My tax assessor tells me that the state has him under the gun all of the time to raise property values.  Real estate is something that has always driven our economy, but for individuals the taxes are making things very hard.  Anything you can do would be much appreciated.  Thanks JOE Paulk

Good morning, 

This is a first for me, I have never written any public officer on any matter, but these insurance and property tax increases are about to break my family.  My husband and I have lived here for 3 years and we have been very fortunate to be able to live a comfortable middle class lifestyle, but, this last year or so things have changed.  We have had many things arise from personal illness of my husband to all the expenses the hurricanes have caused.  Three years ago we visited Navarre Beach on a weekend trip from Tennessee and fell in love with the area.  It being my husbands dream to live near the ocean we decided that while our children were young enough to not be affected by a move, we would move here and relocate our family business and hopefully open a retail store in our new home town.  Unfortunately it looks as if we are going to be lucky if we can sell our house, close our retail store and move our existing business back to Tennessee without losing nearly everything we have due to the increased cost of living in Florida.  We will probably loose a substantial amount of our nest egg to the cost involved in moving and closing our business here.  I guess the reason why I am writing is to let you and others know that this crisis isn't just a problem for the elderly or the poor (not that those folks should not be considered) but a problem for a lot of people that have NEVER had a financial problem.  My husband and I are responsible, thrifty, and self supporting citizens - something like this should not happen to us.    I can only imagine what some people are going to face that don't have as much as we do.    Is there anything that can be done?  I really don't want to leave our home here in Navarre.  Short of winning the lottery or a miracle, I don't know how we will be able to live here much longer.   

Sincerely, 

Concerned Floridian

Dear Gov. JEB,  has the Intangible Tax been officially eliminated yet?  I have heard that you have not actually signed the bill doing away with this unfair tax.

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I understand that you are or have appointed a special group to document the unbelievable increase in property taxes and how it is affecting the residents of Florida.  Well my wife and I are two of those that are “Trapped” in our newly purchased house.  Last November we purchased a larger house because we were moving my wife’s mother (who is 95 years old) in to live with us.  We had to buy this house in order to accommodate her.  We knew that our taxes would increase, BUT NEVER REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD GO FROM $1,783.72 TO $4,031.96.  We are trying to figure out how we are going to come up with that amount of money???  The market is such that we cannot sell the house if we wanted to, so what do we do?  This as you can imagine has put a major strain on our lives and is causing much worry.  Where do we go from here, who can help, I have talked to my Senator Evelyn Lynn and my Representatives and other neighboring Representatives, Dorothy Hukill, Joe Pickens, Pat Patterson, Alan Hays, Sandra Adams and they all have been sympathetic, however that is not going to solve our, and many others, dilemma of taxes they cannot afford.  It is unfair to think that we, the newest buyers will have to pay for those that don’t pay their taxes or are protected under the 3% cap.  We are trapped and struggling to solve the problem.  My wife is disabled and limited on what she can do to earn extra money.  As you can see I work for the state and that income is limited as well.  My Senator and all the Representatives I talked with stated they would be working on legislation to correct the problem and make it affordable for those that have been “TRAPPED” is this tax increase.  Waiting until NEXT year is not going to help all those that are in this current crisis.  It is interesting to note also that our house INSURANCE policy has increased by almost $700 dollars more than it was when we bought the house.  Where will it end?  I moved to Florida in 1968 and started working for the State Health Department and have continued in that for almost 35 years to date.  I love Florida and want to stay here in retirement, can I afford that?  I now have many doubts about that question.  Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

 I already sent one email, with no reply.  I want to know why if one is getting a tax increase, why not everyone?  I understand the 3% cap-but why if unhomesteaded properties are going up 30% and more, why aren't the others going up at least the 3%?  This is a no brainer, but it is not the case-their taxes are going down.  Keep the 3% cap-but raise them the 3%!!!! not reduce them.  This is out right ridiculous!!  You should not have waited until your last 3 months in office to do something about this.  This should have been addressed last September!  I wrote a letter to the Volusia tax office.  Of course, they blew it off with no responsibility.  I need an understanding of the mentality of the homesteaded properties not getting raised the 3%.  I like the way they are having the big meeting Wed. the 20th during the day when most people have to work mind you so they can keep their house from going on the auction block for delinquent taxes!!!
 
Thank you,

Dear Gov.. Bush,
 
Yesterday's St Pete Time Business section listed all your nominees for the insurance problem facing our state of Florida.
 
You have certainly stacked the deck against us home owners by putting the fox to guard the hen house. To quote the St Pete Times, you have named TEN (10) people who have taken money from the insurance industry, and two (2) who are insurance agents. That means there are only three (3) people who will side in any solution for the beleaguered homeowner out of the fifteen (15) people on this committee to solve the high prices we are now paying for homeowners insurance in this state.
 
How can in all your wisdom explain to the populace this OVER STACKING of this panel to solve a problem that is causing many people to leave the state when eighty percent (80%) of the panel is beholden to the insurance industry????????
 
Do you in all honesty expect this 80% to vote against the industry when certain members of this panel have taken up to $95000 from the insurance industry?????????
 
As an 80 year old life long republican whose 1st vote for President was for Tom Dewey, I am elated to know that hopefully for the rest of my life span I will not have to vote for yet one more Bush, because for all the learning you and your Brother have had at the most prestigious colleges world wide, you both lack common sense.

I see there is to be a meeting in Orlando to discuss property taxes.
 
I just want to know that someone knows that Brevard County HAD a 3% cap on property taxes and did away with it this year so they could RAPE us. I received the proposed  tax bill for this year and almost had a heart attack.
Last year, I paid about $750 with homestead exemption and this year it is to be nearly $2000 with all the proposed miliage increases as well as the huge increase in taxable valuation.
If a 3% cap is again put into law, it will be a year too late as the new tax valuations will be in place and we will be stuck at this new level forever.
 
The county is not ONLY going to get a HUGE windfall of extra tax money for the budget busting (homeowner's budget) re-assement, it is also looking to increase the miliage rate as well. There is no way we can pay all this while on Social Security and it is now impossible to sell and have anything left to be able to move out of Florida with to some more reasonable state, if there is such a thing for seniors!
 
I think it is a move to drive ALL seniors out of Florida !
My 85 year old mother is trying to sell her home now and the realtors tell her she will not be able to sell it unless she drops her price again. She is already asking less than Brevard raised her tax evaluation to. She asked them to re-consider the appraisal and was told that nothing can be done now!

PS:  I was "WARN ACT" layed off a year ago and have not been able to find reasonable work since. I am to old and have a history of to high an hourly rate in the past. It looks like I have to just draw SSI and roll over and die!
Job applications do not ask how old you are, they just insist that you have to tell them WHEN you graduated from High School. That does the same thing.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter in reference to the hardship Florida Property Taxes have created for our family.  My husband and I bought a lot in Key Largo several years ago and have slowing built what we hoped would be our retirement home in the next 5 to 10 years.  We built this home ourselves with the help of Home Depot.  It is very small and we have less than $200,000 in the whole project, including the purchase of the vacant land.  There is still a lot left to be done, but we are able to enjoy part time now.  We just received our new property assessment of $1,300,000.00.  I have been crying to the appraiser and they have lowered the value to $980,000.00.  This is still going to make this impossible for us to pay the taxes.  We contacted a local real estate agent about selling the property.  We were informed that the market inventory was very high and the sales were very slow.  She stated that the property may be worth $980,000.00, but we would have to price it at $850,000.00 if we hoped to sell at all.
 
None of this makes any sense to me.  The accessed values are too high and this takes away our dream that we have worked so hard for.  We don't want to sell this home.  It is full of our personal sweat, tears and memories.
 
Who will be able to afford the Florida Keys?  Certainly not very many residents of Florida who make a living legally.  I hear from many people this problem is through out the state and where is all this money going?
 
 
Sincerely,
 
A very disheartened Republican

Subject:	[*] Floridians about to loose a tax deduction afforded to most of the rest of the nation!

Governor Bush,
I am a CPA and I am disturbed at the pace that the nation's tax code is giving up on States without a State Income tax (ie Florida).
  
The following issue was taken from accountantsworld.com newswire:
Taxpayers in states without income taxes may lose federal tax break 
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau (KRT) via NewsEdge Corporation : 
Sep. 17--WASHINGTON -- Congress is rapidly running out of time to extend a tax break that has saved residents of eight states billions of dollars on their federal returns, says the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
The Internal Revenue Service needs to submit this year's tax forms to the printers by Oct. 15. Congress is set to adjourn in roughly two weeks and, at the moment, there isn't even a bill moving forward that would again allow the residents of the eight states to deduct what they pay in state and local sales taxes on their federal returns.
The tax break expired at the beginning of 2006. If Congress does act to extend the sales tax deduction, it would be retroactive to cover the entire year. 
 
Dear Jeb,
This is the best case of the 43 states that have state income tax relief overweighing the rights of the 7 states that do not have an income tax.  This is an outrage that there would be no assistance for tax payers in these few states who are overburdened by the majority of states that do have a state income tax (and generally have a higher pay scale than Florida due to the imposition of the taxes).

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,         
      My name is Lindsay and I am a student at Valencia Community 
College.  Right now I am taking a U.S. Government class and we have an 
assignment to write to one of our public officials expressing our 
opinion on a topic and then asking you what you think.  
       My question is about Low Income Housing Tax Credit.  I think 
this program is great for the truly needing individuals and families 
but what about the rest of us.  My boyfriend and I are both college 
students who work full time and live in an apartment.  While searching 
for an apartment, all of the nicer and newer apartments where tax 
credit housing where that maximum income for two people is only 
$28,000!  Now, we are not rich by any means but together we both make a 
little more than that.  So my question for you is why should we be 
penalized?  We are paying $805 a month for older buildings with rundown 
amenities while some tax credit properties are bran new and have 
computer labs, and nice landscaping, etc. for only $500-$600.
       Again, I am not trying to take away from the Low Income Housing 
Tax Credit Program, but I think others should be able to live in these 
nice new apartment complexes and it would be great to hear back from 
you with your opinion.

Dear Mr. Bush:
I understand there is a meeting in Orlando Wednesday, and I am not able to attend. As a homeowner I would like to voice my opinion at the meeting, but I am currently in Ohio.
 
Whoever makes up this state committee holding the meeting please inform them that I am very interested in giving them my opinion and concerns about property taxes. My home at 9506 Kingsbury Ct., Windermere, Fl. is our dream home.
 
We were furloughed from Orlando Airport with United Airlines. My husband is a mechanic with this company for almost 28 years. United is now outsourcing mechanics at this airport.
We worked very hard to purchase this home, and hoped to return there in a year or so after lay off. Then 9/11 happened. We have taken many pay cuts, and now lost our pension to the PBGC. We have a home in Ohio, Florida, and now an apartment in Chicago(my husband commutes from there each week) because of another furlough. We have 3 girls two of which are in college. We have one income as I chose to stay home and raise our three girls.
Our home in Orange County was built in 91/92. It  was one of two houses on our street. I had weeds growing 8-10 ft. high on each side of my lot. Until the last 5 years. The development built out, and the new homes are much bigger, and more elaborate than my house. I have old Kenmore appliances, no crown molding. I do not have a heated pool, or a spa. We did much of the work our selves in the home. We wanted to spend our retirement years in this home and if the property taxes are not reduced we will be forced to sell. The small amount of pension that we have left it would take 8 months for us to pay taxes let alone insurance, and utilities. This is going to drive people out of the state and county. There are already visible signs. The housing market is saturated with people wanting to get out. I have talked with people in all areas of Florida: Hollywood, Zephyrhills, Tampa Bay, Orlando. They all want out.
I understand there is such a glut in taxes in Orange county that they are renovating West Orange High School this year, then tearing it down to build a new school next year. This is outrageous. This is not how I would handle my money. And as a property tax payer, this is my money and I want a say in how it is spent and collected.
This is a serious situation if it continues, Florida will be a ghost town.
 
Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. If I can arrange my schedule and could be advised of the next meeting I will do my best to attend it.

As our legislature reviews passing a law to allow for tax credits for home owners that storm harden their homes I noticed that there is one aspect of the hardening plan that has been left out.  After working countless hours on the Hurricanes of 2004 and 2005 I noticed that a majority of the homes and utility services were damaged by falling trees or tree debris.  As part of the hardening tax credit I suggest that home owners be given an additional tax credit for taking pro-active measures to have certified arborist trim their trees and remove dead or damaged trees or branches prior to Hurricane season which could become missiles during storms.  This measure would provide additional protection to the measures already considered.

I have never emailed you before.  I say this to emphasize the importance of this email.  For your information and to let you know my experience, I am a Real Estate Broker and owner of Sheffield & Associates.  I have been in real estate for over 10 years now.  The insurance issue facing Florida now is having a monumental impact on the home buying public and if not addressed will lead to an economic depression in the state of Florida.  

 

For years we have been blessed by retirees deciding to make Florida their home.  Taxes were relatively inexpensive, insurance cost were manageable and no state income tax added to their financial security.  They didn't have a major impact on schools or roads and were financially secure enough to not be a burden on any of the social programs.  Their disposable incomes were among the highest of any segment relocating here.  

 

The problem is they can leave just as fast as they came.  They may love our climate, but their disposable income has diminished by their insurance and property tax cost.  

 

The impact insurance will have on business could be massive.  However, for a business to move is an extremely difficult matter.  Also, those with jobs and kids in school will find it more impractical to attempt relocating.

 

I know I am not telling you anything you don't already know.  I know you will do whatever you can to make an unbearable situation more tolerable.  I just want you to know the severe consequence we face.  I has the potential to be more economically devastating than any issue we have ever faced.  In the Pensacola Association of Realtors there are presently 6,739 active listings.  In August there were 582 homes closed.  In August of 2005 there were 707 homes closed and in August of 2004 there were 882 properties closed.  

 

The property insurance situation either will be brought under control or Florida will have the most massive sell off of real property in it's history.  That won't happen though, because there won't be buyers for the homes.

Dear Govenor Bush,
            
            I am a loyal Republican and past president of the St. Petersburg Republican club. I wanted to give you a heads up on our intention to challenge the Constutionality of real estate taxes. We intend to file federal suit this Friday. So you don'tthink that we are anti government, i assure you we have an alternative tax that will more than double the lost revenue. Please reply before Friday. 
                                                                                                                yours truly, Joseph R. Miele Atty. Retired

Governor Bush re: the subject committee, it was asked why there are no consumer advocates? The answer is we don't need members who collect the receipts or decline insurance to owners. We need members who pay the bills! The committee members blame everything on the high price of re-insurance. The only answer to that is have the State provide a backstop for re-insurance and the Federal Government provide a 2nd backstop. We all know this lesson from Katrina. The cronies will decline the hard solutions. Get consumers on the committee.

I hope someone in the Governer's office will read this email and actually do something for a change.  I would also like to hear that you received it and what you plan to do.  

 

I always heard Florida was the place to live.  Older people liked the weather and the low cost of living because they were on fixed incomes.  I acted on what I heard and moved to Florida after I retired.  What a mistake!  I am going broke.

 

Florida is more expensive to live than anywhere else I have lived.  The real estate taxes are double or more in Florida than I pay in Maryland where my property is 25 miles away from the White House and the U.S. Capital.  Florida’s state sales tax is also higher: 7% versus 5% in Maryland.  Yes, Maryland has a state income tax, but with that, the lower sales tax and the lower real estate taxes, it is much cheaper to live there than in Florida.  And, if nothing changes, I have no recourse but to leave Florida for that reason, as are many other people who moved to Florida with the false impression that their expenses would be less and they would be living in paradise.  Florida is not what it use to be.

 

TAXES:  I am paying taxes on my Florida lot for 2006 based on sales of 2005.  It is assessed at $230,736.  I couldn’t sell this lot for that much yet Florida Law determines how the real estate is assessed.  Florida's assessments are also full value and paid in arrears.  In Maryland, 2007 assessments that we pay real estate taxes on are half the value of the property and the taxes are paid in advance.  Maybe Florida needs a change to the law.  Other states don’t assess based on prior year sales and actual values.  That is totally unrealistic, especially when we all know that values were much higher in 2005 than they are in 2006.  We didn’t cause the real estate boom any more than we caused the crash.  Why should we pay taxes (which are way high anyway) on property that is not worth its assessment?    Florida is way out of line in this department.  My Maryland tax bill is attached to show that my property is worth $700,000 at least but the assessment is $304,273 and the taxes are $318.45 for 2007; the 2006 were less than this.

 

My children also have lots in Florida that are assessed for more than they could sell them, as I’m sure many others have. The Florida mileage rate or non-ad valorem taxes must be way out of proportion to other states.  For example, my property in Maryland (6 acres, spring, 5/3/3, 3600 SF, barn, shed, etc.) in the historic Zekia Swamp area (where John Wiles Booth’s leg was set by Dr Mudd), 25 miles from the White House, is appraised at $304,273 which is usually one-half it’s value..  My taxes are $3188.45 for the year because I’m only paying taxes on one-half the value.  That is about $10.00 per thousand.  My lot in Florida, 12,000sf, waterfront, 2800sf house, 4/2/2 is assessed at $236,983 and my taxes are $3183.45.  That is about $13.80 per thousand (copies of the tax bills are enclosed).  In addition, if there are other local taxes (e.g. sewer costs, emergency services, etc., that rate per thousand goes way up).  An example of a lot that is appraised at $83,271, taxes are $1,148.90 plus non-ad valorem of $678.30 makes the rate per thousand $22.00.  That lot won’t sell for $46,000 much less $83,000.  I know this because it’s my son’s lot.  Why?  I know for a fact that the Florida lots that are assessed at $236,983 in my area  are selling for about $150,000 if they sell at all.  What exactly is the State of Florida doing for the property owner?  How can we afford to pay the fees in this state? We can’t even sell them unless we take a significant loss.  It isn’t fair to pay taxes or take a loss on property that isn’t worth the assessment!

 

INSURANCE:  When it comes to insurance. Why can’t disaster expenses be distributed evenly across the US and all US property owners pay a premium that will cover another state in the event of a disaster.  All states have their own disasters:  California has fires, Louisiana has Katrina’s, the Mid West has tornadoes, many states have floods, many states have storm damage. Texas has floods, as do many other states.  There isn’t one state in the country that doesn’t have some sort of disaster that results in exorbitant insurance payouts from time to time.  Florida had hurricanes the last two years.  Prior to that there were no hurricanes for years.  It’s as though the insurance industry which is still in the black is justifying it’s rate increases on a state by state basis, when their profits are averaged out nation wide .  Insurance should not be based on each state’s disaster for that year.  It seems to me that equal distribution of premiums would make it possible for property owners to be able to afford to live where they currently live without fear of having to move because they can’t afford the insurance anymore.  Why isn’t this presented to the legislators? Why do Florida legislators keep granting increases to insurance companies.  My insurance in Maryland is $600 a year for a $700,000 house. Why?  We had a tornado several years ago. I would be happy to pay $700.00 a year for insurance.  It would affect my payment up there by $58.00 - big deal.  It is time for this issue to become Federal!  NO ONE can predict when and where  a disaster is going to hit.  And when it does, guess what, the state citizens are penalized with outrageous premiums. 

 

STATE/COUNTY FEES:  The processes and the fees charged in this state are also ridiculous: impact fees, inspection fees, permitting, unnecessary government employees, constant rate increases, city water/sewer (whether you use it or not), construction and other permits, to name a very few.  I recently built a dock that cost $4,000.  The permit fees were $700.00.  Don’t you think that is a little exorbitant?  The permit fees were almost one-fourth the cost of the dock!  I got a residential construction permit for $200.00 to build a whole house.  But, by the time I was finished construction, my county/state fees were more than $20,000.00.  Give me a break.

 

HOMESTEAD:  The Homestead or Save a Home program in Florida is a joke.  God forbid that you want to move within Florida once you get here.  You will get clobbered with new taxes.  So, as long as you moved to Florida more than 7 years ago, bought a reasonable costing house, and will never move again, you’re OK – don’t try to better yourself and improve your living conditions, you get penalized for that also.  What kind of program is that?  A home doesn’t last forever.  Or it gets clobbered by a hurricane, is unrepairable, there maybe is no home insurance because you can’t afford it, so the person has to move.  To add insult to injury, the state hits the homeowner with a huge tax bill along with unrealistic home insurance, that most homes don’t even need.  In some cases, homes require flood insurance where it never floods.   Is Florida deliberately trying to force its residents to leave?  Money may not be important to the legislator’s but it is to the average citizen.  We can’t afford to live here anymore.

 

All of this is resulting in making Florida a very bad place to live.  Those who like it are those who have the money to afford it or have been here so long they have low costs because they bought years ago and homesteaded their property – but they will still get hit with exorbitant insurance premiums.  Hopefully they will never have to move or then they would also have to leave the state.   I am not poor but Florida is making me poor.  

 

Because of the foregoing, I really have to leave Florida as soon as I can get rid of my real estate which I will have to sell for a lot less than the assessment.  If I do, I could never come back and I would discourage anyone from moving to Florida unless there are some serious changes in this state.  As it is now, only the rich could move here.  Is that what you want?

 

Can you tell me if the Florida government is aware of these issues and if there is any consideration towards making this state more affordable for the average citizen?  I also would rather not receive one of those standardized response letters that says nothing, e.g. “we are aware and are working on these issues………” etc.  How about some answers for a change.  I would welcome an opportunity to participate in any remedial actions.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Let me preface my comments by saying, I support you and President Bush. Thank you for your family's service to our country.

I am writing to you as a Florida citizen, a homeowner and full time, licensed Florida Realtor. On a daily basis, I hear from people who are considering a move to Florida - until they get a reality check regarding property taxes and insurance costs – that is, if they can even get insurance.

 

If we are depending on the much publicized mass migration of baby boomers to buy homes in Florida, I hope everyone thinks twice. Many people are priced out of the market, not necessarily by the price of the house, but by the cost of taxes and insurance. We are seeing local people leave our area for places such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. Money magazine named my town, Punta Gorda Florida, the best small town in the South several years ago - and people are leaving!

 

There are many  local residents here who have expressed their desire to move to another local home or condo; but, they cannot do so because they’ll lose the cap on their property taxes. They feel trapped. There is a great deal of anger and frustration out there. Our insurance bills have tripled, our property tax increases are looming as horrendously higher this year.

 

I think there should be some creative ways to lessen these hardships. My understanding is that if a person owns a home outright and does not have a mortgage, they could NOT self insure securely, because there is no such thing as a separate liabilty insurance policy. I would venture to say that a number of people would self insure for fire, hurricane etc if they could obtain liabilty protection for things like personal injury occuring on the premises, etc. 

 

 

I know you have heard these complaints many times; however, I think it bears repeating. This is a real drag on our economy and certainly damaging to the reputation of our beautiful state. We need reform. 

Thank you.

Hope, this message reaches you in good health and satisfying accomplishments. Also, I hope that you run for President in 2008 for which you will receive ample support from every corner of the nation. Here are some of my thoughts I would like to share with you: 

 

Increase in property taxes hurt the residents and the non-residents of Florida. 

The impact of property tax increases is hardest on low income segment of the population, senior citizens, middle class, single parents, etc. Many of these people get uprooted due to a variety of reasons. Higher property taxes compel the poor and middle class people to sell their property at a much lower price, and move out of the neighborhood, thereby paving the way for the bigger corporation and the rich people to capitalize on the situation. Higher property taxes have always helped the well to do people. If bigger and more luxurious buildings are the sign of prosperity, then this prosperity is certainly stands on the back of people who suffered in the process. The flip side of this is that many of these people end up receiving some form of assistance from the government, and get used to it. Within a few years time, these very people start expecting for the government to bail them out from every possible hardship they face. The disease of Entitlement appears on the scene, and it spreads. It infects people, business ethics, and our free enterprise system. Also, it becomes a way of life for some. 

 

Hotel and motel owners also suffer from the higher taxes, and therefore feel compelled to raise their rates just to be able to stay in business which has essential links to airlines and other travel industry components, etc. Just a little tax hike can send ripples to every business in Florida. But when the taxes go up 100% to 150% then they are bound to spell trouble in short term as well as in long term. Tourism is vital to Florida, and every effort must be made to maintain it at a healthy level. Positive improvements in affordability and pricing, business ethics, service, weather reporting, etc. will keep the tourists and investors coming to Florida for ever. The theme of smaller government and smaller taxes make sense to most Americans, and we all must keep it in focus, because it is beneficial to every aspect of American life. 

 

Out of state investors probably play a very important role in the economic life of Florida. This takes us to the cost of owning and maintaining property in Florida, which involves monthly payments of mortgages, taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance, etc., besides the investment of personal savings, risk, property management. Property management through an agent in Florida is a nightmare which is the least I can describe through my own experience. All these factors, when combined with low income tenants, do not provide an investor with a positive investment outlook in Florida. Could this be the reason that a feverish investment activity is taking place in other Gulf Coast communities? Increase in property taxes, other taxes, lack of control over property managers, and without maintenance of business ethics, etc. will definitely impact the State of Florida negatively. I visit Florida several times each year, and each time I feel difficult to come back. Also during each visit, I feel strongly that much stricter rules of business conduct should be enforced in respect to Property Management Companies, Realtors, Mortgage Brokers, Building Maintenance & Repair Companies to provide some kind of safeguard for out of state investors. This will stimulate more investment in Florida. Governor Bush, you have already done wonders for the State of Florida, and I have a strong feeling that you will reach new heights of excellence in the near future.

Dear Governor,
 
I know you are well aware that many Floridians are beside themselves about how they will be able to pay their Property Taxes and Insurance.
 
My wife and I spend every dime we had to buy a small lot and open a small BBQ Restaurant.  My daugthers gave up their career dreams to help us make it work.
 
After nine years, the realization of owning your own business has come to light... "owning your own business in Florida is just buying yourself a job, and having to pay perpetual Property Tax and Insurance that only keeps going up".
 
The only light at the end of the tunnel is to sell the property.  The only problem with selling is that the Property Tax and Insurance for a buyer would be so high that the investment would not be feasible. 
 
The economic incentive to invest in Florida reality is in danger due to Property Tax and Insurance.  If this attitude continues, Florida's economy could be crippled.  
 
The average Floridian's income can not support these inflationary tax and insurance increases.
 
Governor, I beg of you to help us.  We love Florida, we don't want to lose our business and don't want to move to a more affordable state to retire.
 
Please, Please, call a "Special Session", of our Legislators.  Please instruct them to not even think about adjouring until they have solutions that not only makes Property Tax and Insurance affordable for all citizens, but insures Florida with a sound financial future.
 
Thank you for your help, and thank you for being our Governor.

Gov Bush,
we need help with the OUT OF CONTROL property tax increases. This cannot continue without seriously harming the citizens of this state. No one budgets for 
ever-inceasing property taxes! Please make this known and present a plan for dealing with this - we are at the mercy of the government! We love Florida but we may be forced to leave or downsize to a lower valued house. Thank you for presenting a plan - or the next Gov presenting something we can live with.
 
How about raising the homestead exemption to match real estate appreciation levels - 25k is paltry when a 40 yr old rundown house is worth 250k and up!

Mr. Bush:
I own a home at 9506 Kingsbury Ct., Windermere, Fl. My husband works for United Airlines and we were transferred out of Orlando because of his job. We always hoped for a recall to Orlando Airport, then 9/11 happened and that put an end to our hopes. We still plan on retiring in our Windermere home. In the mean time United Airlines filed bankruptcy and we lost our pension to the PGBC. If we retire in 3 years our retirement will be $1300 month. 
Our proposed property taxes are $8,100. How can we afford this? We are going to be forced to sell our dream home. How can people afford to retire there?
The property taxes are going to force people to leave the county and state, for more economically reasonable place to live. 
I have filed a petition with the board to see if I can find comparables because my home was built in 1989, we moved in in 1992. The house is outdated, it has an entry level Sears Kenmore oven, and refrigerator. Formica counter tops, not heated spa, or gas fireplace. No crown molding. The new houses in my neighborhood have drove the price of mine up. These homes are beautiful, upgraded to the max. I just don't see how my home compares to them. It seems unfair to me to let them set my property value.
Please help keep Fl. a reasonable place to live.

Dear Govenor Jeb Bush:

I am writing to you concerning Florida Statute 723.031 (5)(c), the "pass-on" tax to mobile home park residents.  This statute allows the property owner of Mobile Home Rental property to pass his ad valorem property tax to residents who rent mobile home lots.

Each year my lot rent is increased, in addition to the "pass-on" tax, when the owner receives the ad valorem tax on his property.

I feel that real estate taxes should be paid for by the person who owns the real estate, and not be passed on to the person renting the property. I own a mobile home and am responsible for "my" taxes, and feel that the park owner should be responsible for "his" taxes.

Most senior citizens are on a fixed income, and with the  continued increase in food, gasoline, prescriptions and insurance on our property (due to hurricanes), many have difficulty paying for medicine and food, as well as facing increases in food, gasoline and insurance. We should not have to pay for the landlord's property.

I believe this law in unconstitutional. I don't believe the framers of our Constitution would expect citizens who do not own real estate beer responsible for the land owner's taxes. I don't recall this statute being on a ballot for me to vote on.

THIS IS A VERY UNFAIR LAW AND SHOULD BE REPEALED. 

I am requesting that you consider my view and give me guidance. I look forward to hearing from you.
 

Sincerely,
 
 
KelliAnn Hall and

Subject:	Property Tax Solution Ideas

I guess some of the ideas I have below have been throught of already, but maybe there's one that's new.

1)  Increase the Homestead exemption to 1990 levels.  

This idea comes from my general philosophy that all laws should be required to have a time-component in them.   Saying that any decision is outside of the time-domain is rediculous, but we do it every day at all levels of government.  Clearly, $25,000 in 1990 dollars (I hope I have the year right), is not the same today.  The "intention" of the law was to offer an equivalent homestead exemption - by today I think the number is about $100,000.  But whatever the number is, it should be calculated exactly and fairly using the rate of inflation of real estate values only.  In other words, food, gas and other commodities that have nothing to do with real estate inflation should not be considered.

2)  Tax only the land

I recently calculated the cost of my taxes over the lifetime of the house I just built.  The amount of taxes paid at 3% increase per year comes to 2.5 Billion dollars.  This number defies logic.  It certainly makes me feel silly standing in Lowe's deciding between the $80 tub-filler vs. $120 one.  In fact, my first impression when I did this calculation was to say to myself - "who really owns this property".  I think the number is so great that it really begs for that question to be answered.  To satisfy myself, I decided that the "land" was really the juridiction's.  It was made by God and can not be moved.  If I choose to improve it, then I implicitly accept the fact that the land can not be moved, destroyed, etc.

3)  Tax according to improvement lifetime

If #2 above is to far of a politcal stretch, then at least r/e taxes based on improvements shoudl be inversely proportional to the lifetime of the structure.  For example, in my case I built my own house as an owner-builder.   As such I wanted a robust structure.  I heard once that the insurance industry has roughly 3 classes of building lifetimes - 100 year, 200 year and Permanent Building construction.  100 year is "stick-framed", 200 year is block built and PBC is basically poured concrete and/or stone.  In my house I fully poured concrete in all the block walls.   Naturally concrete is "incomplete" without its steel partner, so I put 2 miles of rebar in the wall first.  The whole thing cost me about $3,000 extra - well worth it.  I figure my building is 300 year construction.  But now I'm being charged extra taxes on my better structure - go figure.  So, if I build a wood shack that'll stand for 50 years, it'll be cheaper to construct, cost less in taxes and ultimately be worth far less to the county.  I think it's obvious what's wrong with this equation. 

4)  Owner-Builders should be part of the protected SOH class from the time they break ground

When I bought my land in 1998 and started construction as an owner-builder, I estimated my cost to build at $135,000 - a number that was about 50% higher than the average in my area, but my house was very large (over 6000sf).  Anyway, as an owner-builder I'm excluded from the contractor licensing laws under very stringent conditions.  Most notable are that I must be present during construction and that I must occupy the property when completed.  The first requirement caused me to take 6 years to build the house.  In my mind this timeframe is quite reasonable given the labor input to size of building ratio I was dealing with.  (Think about building a skyscraper.  Even with a large crew, it takes many years because the project is big. Also, BTW, the buidling code does not set time limits on construction because it is generally not structurally unsound to take time to build. The fact that I had to renew my 2 year permit 3 times has more to do with the convenience of the county not having to track my paperwork.)  The second constraint - that I live in my house once  built - comes from the rationale that we don't want unlicensed contractors to act as owner-builders in name only.  So, in effect, I became a stakeholder in my homesteading from the start of my construction.  To me, the date that I started construction should be the one used by the appraiser's office for valuation.  Naturally, I'd expect a 3% yearly rise from that point, but that number would be far less than the $600,000 that the appraiser's office came up with when I finally was done and the "clock stopped".  Adding insult to injury, I moved in on Oct 1, 2004, but the clock was not stopped until Jan 1, 2005 - at a timeframe when r/e values were rising at 3% per month. 

5)  An overall cap of 10% for all assessable value taxes

Whether it be a business, SOH, greenbelt or otherwise, the limit should be 10%.  Now, I can't fault the wisdom of those in 1990 for not including this in, because what's happened to r/e values in the past 3-5 years is un precedented, six-sigma, etc.  And will probably never happen again.  But let's protect ourselves now that we're a bit smarter.  Now naturally, this just simply creates a "potential" tax in the same way that SOH works.  In other words, the "assessed" value can (and will) eventually meet the "just" value.  It will simply be meted out over a slightly longer time in the case of fantastic increases in values.  In fact, I think this should be made retroactive and any excessed returned to those who paid it in the form of future credits.  I know this is a tough calculation, but -hey- we have computers nowadays.

6)  DONT allow transfer of SOH to newly purchased property.  

First of all I think this ideas goes against the grain of the purpose of SOH - to protect us in our older, flat-income days.  Anyone trading homes shouldn't have this protection.  If trading up - I don't have sympathy.  If trading down - the profit from the house should ease the pain.  But, the biggest reason I don't like this is because it even more so creates a dichotomy in our society  - those that lived/bought here before the "great inflation", and those after.  The only way I can support this is if there's a rollback in time/prices to equate all of us on this playing field.  Otherwise there will be this group of "gap" people that bought just at the peak because they reacted faster than the government to plug the leak.  It's bad enough that we suffer the (unavoidable) slowness of government's reaction, but when it does react it must act fairly.
 
7)  Tax based NOT on r/e values

I really think that the intention of government is to be fair.  When the idea of taxing citizenry based on r/e values was invented (hundreds/thousands of) years ago, there were no computers/accounting/visibility/communication like we have nowadays.  Now we can much more clearly say what the cost of each citizen is on the jurisdiction they live in.  For instance, some people have children in school - some do not.  Some people drive big trucks that wear the roads down a little faster.  Some use water/energy more, pollute more, etc.  In other words. what someone pays can quite easily today be assessed according to their direct costs.  Again, we are in a computer age.  Let's start using them as a tool to create a fairer society. 

Anyway, this was a long letter, and I'm sure you're a busy man.  Perhaps, if I'm lucky this letter will get read by one of your assistants, and if I've done my job well enough will spark interest.


Thanks,
Jim Mastro

Subject:	High Insurance and Taxes

My husband and I are both Republicans, and we have voted the straight Republican ticket, however, the State of Florida is dying.  It is being killed by ridiculously high insurance and tax rates.  The school systems here were very surprised that there are not as many children in the public schools as expected, and some have even lost children as here in Pinellas County.  Duh! No surprise here.  Young families cannot afford to live here due to the high insurance and tax rates.  Many are single parent families.  The tourists are not coming here, retirees won't be moving here, nor young families.  There were over 29,000 foreclosures in 2005, mostly due to families not being able to pay the high insurance and tax rates. 
 
We are being taxed by the City of St. Petersburg as if our houses were valued at an escalated value.  No houses are selling here.  We couldn't sell our house (if any houses were selling here) for anywhere near the value they have placed on our house for tax purposes.
 
State Farm doubled our insurance from last year.  I know people who have found buyers for their house, but potential buyers couldn't get affordable insurance so they backed out.
 
My frail neighbor is over 75 years old, and has gone to work doing home health care (running errands and so forth) as she cannot afford to be retired without losing her house.  She also has State Farm insurance which doubled her cost this year.
 
Florida is going to be over-run with a whole new class of homeless people if something is not done.  Retirees who have used up all of their money paying insurance and taxes, young families who are living month to month, and the middle class people who have become the new Florida poor needing more services, naturally.
 
The St. Petersburg City Council voted last night to approve the new 6.60 mills on the inflated housing value in spite of the citizens' pleas for relief.  I hope they have set aside a lot to aid the new homeless.
 
Florida is sending out a message to the whole country  DON'T COME HERE.  Something needs to be done, and it needs to be done fast.  
 
Sincerely,

Hello Governor Jeb Bush
 
We the people of Florida are coming into some bad times in the state of Florida, to the extent many people are going to be losing their homes, in part by the way Florida is taxing
the people on property taxes and now insurance rates. 
 
I have lived in Florida now for six years as a non resident to be near my son that has lived in Florida as a resident for 20 years. I would like to become a resisdent but cannot due to being a resisdent of Michigan. If I become a resident of Florida I would lose my medical insurance
in Michigan that I have had for many years.
 
Here in Stuart Florida, county of St lucie just sent out the proposed taxes for the year 2006
and I went into shock. My property tax will increase from $3,182.93 to $7,0031.08. That is completly out of hand. This house my wife and I live in is only 2000 sq ft, not a big house.
Like many familys in Florida we are subject to losing  our home due to  property taxes and insurance rates. Our home owner insurance increased back in March of this year from $1500.00 to $2500.00. Where is it going to stop. Here in Florida, like many other states you cannot sale  a home due to the cost of the house, taxes and insurance. As a non resisdent
I only want to be treated fair nothing more nothing less. What can be done to help us to reduce these cost?
 
I will attach the propsed taxes on this house to this e-mail please read it and respond. My phone number is 772-529-0331. If it does not come through let me know and I will send a copy by mail. My address is: 133 Captiva Cove Stuart Fl. 34994

Dear Governor Bush,


I support you and would like to know if before you leave office if your office could look into changing a law concerning:

12A-15.003 Admissions; Tangible Personal Property; Services; Service Warranties; Real Property and Transient Accommodations; Use Tax.(4) SALES OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY.


I am among thousands who will be selling on the internet. As far as the law goes now, I must charge a different sales tax amount on every different county where I ship my product to.  It's a nearly impossible feat to not only compute the difference on the shopping cart but also to fill out the forms with the correct amounts considering the amount of sales I plan to make.  I went to different sites and found that some estimate the amount and others are charging the highest possible amount.  I called the Department of Revenue to see if the state of Florida is planning on joining the The National Governors Association (NGA) which has developed the Streamlined Sales Tax Project (SSTP). To learn more about this, visit the Streamlined Sales Tax page. States have been working to streamline and simplify their sales tax rules, thus removing the burden of collecting taxes for multiple jurisdictions. To date, 42 states have approved a model interstate agreement that establishes uniform sales tax rules and definitions. Can you let me know asap where Florida stands.  It's unethical to establish a policy that is nearly impossible to keep.  I want to pay taxes to whom taxes is due but Florida is sure making it hard.  Awaiting your prompt response.

I’m not sure if I have this all straight or not but I want to have a rebuttal. I personally don’t want slots but my purpose is to be able to respond to those who do in a positive manner. They are really down on the Republican Party because of this.

Subject:	URGENT!!  REQUEST a Bay County Tax RollBack and reasonable cap, from a life-long Republican
Attachments:	Tom Neubauer letter.pdf

Governor Bush:
 
This petition is to request a Bay County Tax Rollback for those of us who own property in Bay County but have no homestead exemption or 3% Tax Cap.  My family home is in Parker FL (Bay County).  The home, which remains in our family, was built in 1959 by my mother, also a life-long Republican who worked at the Bay Republican Party for your father, your brother and your election to public office.  Since my father's death, my sister and I have rented our house out and hope to return to our home in FL one day. However, the excessive tax appraisal on our property may make that impossible.  Last year, our house and land was assessed at $135,667; this year the appraised value of our property was $340,710, a 251% tax increase in one year. Will such property tax increases continue? Because our house is older, even though we maintain it, we are able to rent it out for only $1,000 a month. 
 
I drove from Houston, TX to the Bay County Appraisers' office to hear Rick Barnett say on Monday he and a group of appraisers would meet with you later this week to request a tax rollback for those of us who will suffer from such a huge tax assessment in one year.  Even with a tax adjustment, my appraised value is still at $319, 873. Like others in Bay County, my sister and I understand waterfront property will continue to go up in value and have never protested any assessment before even as our property taxes have increased.  And we realize property taxes are needed for infrastructure development and education.  But we believe a land value assessment based on averaging the sales of properties in Bay County when a developer "buying boom" occurred in 2005 coupled with the current stagnated real estate market in our Parker area is a grossly unjust way to assess property taxes on small landowners. Because high density condominium development in Bay County has led to real estate stagnation, the assessed value of our property is greater than the selling price we could get for our property if we had to sell it.  I am attaching a letter from our realtor who corroborates this, given the bay area where our property is located which is not like the lush developed Panama City Beach area.
 
We have been good citizens and taxpayers, caring for our property until we can return home.  My sister and I have been life-long Republicans, believing campaign rhetoric that the GOP and its party leaders opposed excessive taxes.  We also do not want to believe, as some suggest, the higher taxes assessed on those who have no homestead exemptions are a way to force those who own single-family dwellings along the water to sell cheaply to developers who in turn will over develop the waterfront area reaping huge profits and ruining the environment we wish to protect.  Nor, do we wish to believe, as others suggest, the planned meeting between you and Rick Barnett is just a ruse, a political means to deflect taxpayer anger without any real relief.  THEREFORE, we request you grant a Bay County property tax rollback and set a reasonable cap for those owning single-family dwellings along the water. Thus, we ask for your help.  Respectfully,  Rita Benoit Griffin, Houston, TX (also for Rose Brodersen, Rosamond, CA)

Subject:	Okaloosa County Property Tax

Dear Governor Bush,
MANY people in Northwest Florida are VERY concerned about the rising property taxes.  They are entirely out of hand this year...especially in Okaloosa county.  We have lived here many years  and this is the first year that we have felt compelled to follow through with the suggestions on the TRIM notice.  I went to all the meetings and I have to say it was one of the most depressing ordeals I have been through.  There were many speakers and much of what I heard compelled me to write you.  MANY people have already left Florida for Alabama....and many more are planning to. A doctor in Okaloosa county can no longer afford her property taxes and plans to leave.  So, this is having an impact  on all economic groups.   And a great deal of them are folks who have lived here all their lives.  One man spoke in very broken English that in all his travels and the many places he has lived he has never seen anything like it....not Russia...not China, etc.  (This embarrassed me...and I had nothing to do with it!)  These high prices are REALLY affecting people's lives.....not to mention the detrimental effects it  will have on the economy.  People do not want to invest here any longer.  Many will not be able to work in the area  because they can not afford it.  One woman spoke to the fact that even though she had applied for the homestead exemption,  it will not go into effect till next year... and this year her property value increased at a rate much higher than her neighbors who had comparable houses.  She could only conclude that hers was artificially increased before her exemption goes into effect. (She did say she filed  an appeal, but it worries me for people who do not know to do this.)  Another person was going to have to take out a loan to pay property taxes.  (They went up so much last year that he figured it had probably "topped out".) And to make matters worse...it seems that none of the taxing authorities ever  have enough money to do all the things they need to do.  This gets soooo old and is very hard to hear when many people spend more on taxes than they do on their own families!!  Over the years we have paid property taxes in several counties and, for some reason that I do not understand,   Okaloosa county has always seemed unnecessarily high.  Sometimes it boggles the mind as to what is done with that much money!  One thing that became painfully obvious...we have all financed enough layers of taxing bodies that it is very easy for them to "pass the buck" to a different body!  The blame bounced all over Okaloosa county...then branched out to other counties...it even bounced all the way to Tallahassee!  That seems to be a problem of our society...a lack of personal responsibility.  And many of the things we are financing stem from the fact that government attempts to help all the people who do not take any personal responsibility themselves!!  I do not know the answer, but perhaps they are simply trying to finance some things that would be best if left alone.  I am sure that all these people have good intentions and maybe just do not fully realize the cumulative damage that is being done.
I could go on, but I will spare you.  I am writing to let you know that we need help in Okaloosa County (and perhaps in other Northwest Florida counties).  Something needs to be done to decrease the amount owed...and it needs to be done across the board.  It needs to be done for ALL types of properties...on an equal and fair basis ... that does not pit one group of people against another.  It also needs to be done THIS taxing year.  Too many people are just not able to afford it.   This has a very bad ripple effect that ends up hurting us all!!  We all hope that you can maybe call a special meeting soon to address these problems for this year...and the years that follow.  We would all certainly appreciate your help with this!
Thank you for your help with this matter...and THANK YOU for being our governor!

Judy Craparo

To The Representatives of the People of the State of Florida:

 

I currently serve as an Assistant State Attorney in the third judicial circuit of Florida.  I love what I do and I believe with all my heart that I have the greatest job in the world.  As an Assistant State Attorney I also represent the people of the State of Florida.  Every time that I try a case, I make certain that my jury knows that I am prosecuting the defendant on behalf of the “People of the State of Florida.”   However, Assistant State Attorneys are so much more than "Prosecutors"; we are the gatekeepers of the judicial system.  Without us, many innocent people would be prosecuted and many guilty people would go free.  Law enforcement officers generally do the best that they can, but they are not lawyers.  They do not always understand elements of crimes or burdens of proof.    In small communities, the only source of guidance that most of these officers have is from their Assistant State Attorney.  How sad it is that ASAs who have the knowledge and experience to guide these officers, often cannot afford to continue in the positions they love.  In many cases, ASAs must choose between paying their student loans and paying their rent (typically rent because they seldom can afford to buy a house.)  

A senior prosecutor once told me that he could teach a monkey to try a case, but he could never teach a prosecutor to have good judgment.  Unfortunately, the prosecutors with good judgment cannot usually afford to stay.  An experienced prosecutor with good judgment is a commodity that is fast fading from today’s courtroom and the result will ultimately be disastrous.  How will the innocent victim of a brutal rape be able to place their confidence in the prosecutor fresh out of law school whose only experience is the mock trial team?  How will the beautiful young woman with the hideous scar across her face feel when she finds out that the ASA prosecuting the person who slashed her face, over a parking place, has never tried a felony case before? How will the American public feel when the child molester goes free because the ASA on the case  was transferred from county traffic court to felony because the experienced felony prosecutor just couldn't afford to stay?  We all know how they will feel...now what to do about it.  

CLEARLY, WE MUST INCREASE THE STARTING SALARIES AND ADJUST THE SALARIES OF THE VETERAN ASAs IN COMPARABLE AMOUNTS AND WE MUST IMPLEMENT A STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PLAN.  ADDITIONALLY, ANYTHING LESS THAN HIGH RISK RETIREMENT FOR ASAs IS ABSURD.  

ASAs are on the front line every time they walk into the courtroom.  ASAs stand in courtrooms packed with family and friends of defendants and demand...or at least urge...judges to take away the freedom of defendants.  We argue cases to juries and explain to them why the defendant's account of the events just does not make sense.  We point out every admissible flaw in a defendant's story and in their character and we boldly assert the need to imprison them for their wrongs.  And we do this unarmed and in full view of anyone who decides to come to court that day.  We do this with our backs to the audience and our attention on the job at hand.  The officer on the street is no longer the enemy; all he did was catch them.  The Judge is forgiven because he/she would not have sentenced the defendant to prison if that awful Prosecutor had not said all those terrible things about the defendant.  Suddenly the ASA is the one at fault.  They have special names for most of us at the local jails!  We don't wear robes and we don't have bailiffs.  We don't wear guns on our belts and we can't bring our guns into the courtroom but we do stand up and fight for what we believe is the "just" outcome!  For this, we don't qualify for high-risk retirement!?!?!

What the legislature does not seem to understand is that many ASAs are out banging on the doors of victims and witnesses while preparing for trials.  We follow up on information provided to us and often find ourselves knocking on the doors of former (and sometimes current) defendants looking for a witness or victim in our case.  Some agencies have investigators for these purposes but often the follow up needs to be done and the investigator is simply not available.  ASAs get up in the middle of the night and go out to crime scenes and they trudge down to the office to assist with search warrants as needed.  Again, for this we don't qualify for high-risk retirement?!?!

Stop and think about it, if you were truly convinced that your loved one was being unfairly prosecuted and you sat through a trial listening to the ASA tell how everything was your loved ones fault and pointing out every reason that your loved one was guilty, then you had to hear a closing argument that was good enough to convince a jury to convict your loved one...and finally you listened as some stranger argued passionately enough about your loved one to get them sentenced to life in prison....WHO WOULD YOU BLAME?  WHO WOULD YOU AIM BOTH YOUR ANGER AND POSSIBLY YOUR WEAPON AT...it would be the ASA.  High risk is not only justified, it is ESSENTIAL. 

NOW HOW DO WE FUND IT?  HOW DO WE KEEP OUR SEASONED ASAs?  There is a $40.00 public defender application fee in cases where defendants seek to have the public defender appointed.  There are costs assessed when the public defender or appointed counsel are assigned to represent a defendant, why not do the same with prosecution?  

I propose that we simply add a cost of prosecution fee to each and every criminal case, not just those that go to trial, but to all cases:  Criminal Traffic, $50.00 per case, Misdemeanor, $100.00 per case, and Felonies, $250.00 per case.   

Assess this fee across the board and earmark the funds for ASA salaries and student loan repayment plans.  .  Make the criminals pay to retain the experienced Assistant State Attorneys and keep the experienced ASAs around to see that inexperience due to inadequate salaries does not result in criminals going free.  This would minimize the state's contribution to funding, provide adequate salaries for Assistant State Attorneys and provide for experienced, competent prosecution of criminal cases in the State of  Florida.  We are not seeking a handout, just a hand up.

Subject:	MEXICO BEACH (BAY COUNTY) PROPERTY TAXES

Dear Governor Bush,
 
The property owners in Mexico Beach have seen an absurd increase in property taxes for the past two years.  Some properties increased in 2005 over 500% and again in 2006 as much as 300% - 500%.  These increases over the past two years are causing a financial burden for everyone.  It is time, TODAY, for some changes at the State Level to be made so these types of increases will not continue to happen.  Also because of the way we, the taxpayers, have been unfairly treated, I feel it is time for a decision to be made to compensate the taxpayers for the drastic increases we have had to endure over the past two years.  
 
Many property owners that have lived in Mexico Beach for years and are on a fixed income are facing the reality of having to sell their home and move elsewhere.  Property Owners from out of state that have bought property as a 2nd Home are considering selling and purchasing property in another State.  If a WISE decision is not made soon, the whole area will be devastated.  Rental property will be so high, renters will not be able to afford to rent.  The Real Estate market has been at an all time Low for over a year now.  The widespread news of the exorbitant taxes propety owners are having to pay has only made matters worse.  Our area, and like most other areas in Florida, depend on Tourist Dollars.  
 
Please understand this is an issue that must take High Priority at the State level.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] Real Estate tax assessment--Bay County, FL

 
Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I am a resident of Bay County and a Florida resident since 1978.  I have paid taxes in Leon, Gadsden and Bay counties.  I am a retired federal employee receiving Federal civil service and social security.  I am a widow and age 66.
 
After my husband's death, I sold my Tallahassee residence and with the proceeds purchased a lot in Bay County and completed my home in November, 2005.  My house is eligible for homestead exemption for 2006.  I have been assessed an almost 300% increase in the value of my lot.  My lot was not subject to the 3% cap on taxes, because my house was not completed early enough to file homestead for 2005.
 
My tax bill increased from $1993 for 2005 based on lot assessed value of $133,000.  My lot was assessed at almost 300% more than I paid for it.  My ad valorem tax increased to $9682 for 2006.  Tax alone is 23% of my retirement income.  It was difficult and also very expensive to obtain windstorm and homeowner's insurance.  At a combined cost of more than $14,000 tax and insurance for 2006, I cannot afford to stay in my home; however, almost no homes have sold in Panama City Beach since early 2005.  I do not know where to turn.
 
Please do all that is in your power to rollback property values for Bay county, offer senior citizens a higher homestead exemption, or whatever it takes to keep the citizens of Florida in Florida.  We need immediate help. 
 
Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush,    
 
The Save our Homes must be repealed.
 
This has created 2 classes of property owners. Homesteaded is one class and businesses and non-homesteaded owners are the other class.
The latter class is not being represented. This is taxation without representation and cannot last.
 
Business will not located here if this keep up and non-homesteaded owners will sell.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
My husband and I own a small property in Pompano Beach called Croton Arms Resort Apartments. We have been here for 15 and a half years now. Our resort consists of 3 different folios and we are shocked with the outrages property tax bills we have received. The largest of our properties consisting of 12 apartments has been hit with a 113% increase in taxes or a $13,130.17 additional tax, the next folio consisting of our house and two small rental apartments has been increased by 67% or $3,100.00, the last folio located across the street has been hit with 65% or $2,751.00 amounting to a total of $18,884.64. Where are we supposed to get this money to stay in business Governor? In January 2002 we had to take a loan from SBA after 9/11. In 2005 we applied for the Emergency Bridge Gap Loan after Wilma did a lot of damage to us and waiting for the insurance to come through. It is another story how little the insurance paid us. Yesterday we watched the budget hearing at the county and there were 70 different taxpayers outraged and this is the first hearing. Not too much was mentioned with regards to business like us. Somebody needs to stand up for us.
 
We are still hurting from 9/11. We have a total of 3 apartments occupied at the moment out of 20. Are we expected to go and borrow more money? By the way we are still paying SBA loan for a total of 18 years.We cannot afford employees. This antiquated tax law has to change Governor Bush. It is not fair. Are we going to be able to sell our properties for the valued price that the property appraisers office say our property is worth? Portability is not going to help business owners, all this does is shifts the burden to us. The ones that are hurting are business owners, out of state property owners and people who are not homesteaded. Is this fair that we are left holding the bag for the homesteaded property owners. We do not believe so. We strongly believe that we are being put out of business. Yes, we can appeal the property taxes and hire a lawyer to argue on our behalf and pay one third of what they manage to save us. We were told that we stand very little chance of a reduction.This is unjust Governor. We believe that a cap of a 10% increase for businesses and non homesteaded properties would be fairer. We realize that you will not be running for another election, we have a great deal of respect for you and humbly ask if you can help with this unjust tax system, we have worked very hard in our business for a long time and it is not fair to loose it. This is to be our retirement or so we thought.
 
We thank you in advance for your kind co-operation.

Dear Gov. Bush and Lt. Gov. Jennings,
 
The article in the Tampa Tribune prompted me to write about the $12 Million you plan give the trades who will in turn train 10,000 new trades people in Florida.
 
This is a commendable endeavor and will provide income to a lot of trade schools, construction companies and agencies who do training.  It will also provide a large number of entry level trades people the opportunity to learn a craft in which they can earn a living.  This usually takes Seven to Ten YEARS for a tradesman to reach the level of income that could be called a living wage.
 
On Sunday July 29, 2006, Mr. Joe Brown, Editorial writer for the Tampa Tribune wrote a column concerning the price of housing in the area.  I responded to that column with the letter below and I include it for your attention because I believe you are about to enter into a NO-WIN situation with your grant money unless you address the housing situation in the State of Florida.  
 
Your plan to train new Trades will attract many individuals from other states who are looking for this FREE training.  They will get the training and return home to secure a job where the affordable housing is available.  We will still be in need of qualified trades, even though we have spent millions to train people.  
 
We have subsidized housing for those who qualify.  We DO NOT have AFFORDABLE housing for the BLUE COLLAR workers.  Our FHA 235 (and other FHA programs) are long gone.  Let us address the housing issue for our Trades at the same time we address the training issue.  It may take another FHA Program to help us alleviate this problem, but surely we are not the only State with this problem.

Subject: Sunday 7/29/06 Column
 
Joe,
 
Your Sunday column brings to the forefront a problem I have been experiencing over the past several months.  Being a Real Estate Broker with several rentals of my own as well as those I manage for others, puts me in position to see trends before some other people.  The trend is that we are eliminating housing for the "Blue Collar" Workers whether it is the demise of trailer parks or the increased price of housing.
 
The median and average price of houses in Hillsborough County is over $250,000.00.  Those who purchase must have the ability to repay the mortgage.  Likewise the renters but on a shorter term.  The average wage of the Blue Collar has increased but not to the extent of the housing cost increase.
 
Many of our trades people are here for specific jobs such as the Rework of Malfunction Junction (now in its 40th year); the construction of New Homes, New Office Buildings, New Roads and Streets in Developments, and in the Repair of Hurricane Damage, etc.  Some of the trades go "back home" but soon return because "back home" winter time work is not as remunerative as Florida work.
 
Some of my golfing friends suggested sending these folks to Plant City, but the "Holding on to Hometown" article on the same page as your column indicates this is soon not going to be an alternative.
 
When I came to Tampa in 1963, Clair Mel City was well underway as a home for people who are in need of this type of housing.  Progress Village soon became a similar community.  These homes were built under the FHA 235 Program (or other such FHA Programs).  Where is our FHA 235 Program for Hillsborough County or any other Florida County today?
 
Our County Leadership would prefer to build a Noise Abatement Wall for Cheval or a "Sports Complex" in the Plant City Area than to address the growing problem of Housing!  I am not sure if we have enough Subsidized Housing, but I know we do not NOW have enough housing for our Blue Collar Workers. The worker who likes to go HOME in the afternoon, see their kids running around in the yard or neighborhood with their animals, sit under a tree or on their porch and consume their favorite beverage, and then be able to know they can afford to stay there as long as they wish - ONE year or 100 years.
 
Thank you for allowing me to vent!  Hopefully, I will see a column on this sometime.

Mr. Bush, The property taxes in Florida are too much for the citizens to bear.At the level they are now no one can sell their house because the taxes are too high and that makes buying and selling impossible.I would love to leave Florida because the people here are getting taken advantage of with these tax rates and getting very little in return.I feel like I lost my freedom to get out because noone can buy under these circumstances.In Volusia County where the poorest population is the taxes are the third highest in the state.We have to pay for a hospital with the West Volusia tax authority assessed on our property tax bill when we can't even afford health insurance.Please get rid of this tax authority.Hospitals are rich and are businesses that do not need to be suppoted by the people through taxes.Save Our Homes is a shame and needs to be stopped.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I own vacant land in Lee County (Cape Coral), Florida.
The increase in property taxes over the past two years has been tremendous.
This increase cannot possibly be warranted since there are over 8,000 vacant lots
on the market in the Lee County area.
Also, not being a resident, causes my Florida property taxes to be even higher
while I do not utilize the services the taxes pay for nor do I impact the infrastructure
of Lee County.
This does not seem right.
 
While the taxes are based on past sales, this is a year or more behind.
Property cannot be sold now for what it even sold for 6 months ago let alone year ago or more.
 
I own my home and property in Colorado and pay less property tax for this property
than for one vacant lot in Lee County.
This is ridiculous.
I have talked with the local assessor's office and a County Commissioner's office
and am told there's nothing I can do about the increases since it's controlled by Florida law.
The methodology utilized was correct so my filing a protest would be a waste of time.
I was told that the local magistrate would rule that the property tax calculations are correct.
 
I implore you to look into the property taxing structure in Florida and restructure it to where
it is fair for residents and non-residents.
 
Should you or a member of your staff wish to discuss this further, please contact me.

Hi Governor Bush. I'm a big fan of yours and your brother's as well. I voted for both of you and I will miss you both when you leave office. I wanted to ask you something as my Governor. I live in Fort Lauderdale, FL and things these past two years have gone crazy around here. I love Florida so much that I would hate to have to leave. Unfortunately between the big increase in both property taxes and in my homeowner's insurance, I feel that I can no longer afford my beloved city. I really don't want to leave but I work full time (for my bills) as I say and there's nothing left when I'm done. Interest rates on mortgages need to go down as well. I don't think that I'm alone at this because I hear it all over the place. Is there anything that can be done? Please let me know before it's too late for me. Thank you, Daisy

I received your recent correspondence asking me to support Republican
candidates in the next election.  You stated that your administration
had kept taxes low. While I think that you personally have done a good
job as Governor during some trying times, that is not my personal
experience.

I have owned a vacation home in Ocala, Florida for 9 years.  Since it
is not my homestead the taxes have risen from $600 per year to almost
$3,000 for 2006 (last year's tax was about $1,500).

I have not sold it, and do not intend to sell it, and thus have not
realized some huge profit.  I had hoped that my grandchildren would grow
up spending summers and weekends there.  I do not know if that will be
possible.  How can people afford to keep these properties?  A tax
increase of this magnitude is unconscionable.  It would do no good to
appeal to the tax board as acreage in the area has gotten very expensive
as they are breaking up alot of the big farms into 10 and 20 acre
ranchettes.

It is fine to readjust taxes on properties after a sale has occurred,
but increases across the board are putting an unfair burden on long-term
residents.  

We need some tax relief and I hope that does not have to come at the
cost of a Democratic victory in November.

               I dont know if that's the politically correct way to address a  governor but I feel like 
             I can call you by your first name. The whole Bush family is just great in my eyes.I was

            thank-you for serving our state with honor and dignity. 
            You are leaving big shoes for the next Republican Governor to fill. 
            I would like you to look into the property appraisals here in Escambia County and in 
            Bay County. Here in Pensacola,  the property values were based on real estate sales in 2005. That 
            happens to be the year AFTER Ivan destroyed our area and, of course, there was a housing 
            shortage and prices sky-rocketed. Now the prices have some-what leveled off but the damage 
            is done. My boyfriend and I have worked hard and saved up money and purchased a very modest 
            house in Mexico Beach ( Bay County) for our retirement. The TRIM notice we received from Bay 
            County shows a FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT increase in our propety appraisal and taxes. There 
            are lots of folks suffering here in the Panhandle. I would truly appreciate anything you can do to 
            give us some relief. Thank you for your  time.              Sincerely,

12 September 2006


Governor Jeb Bush
The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399

Dear Governor Bush,

I have owned a rental condo in Palm Bay FL since the mid-1980's.  It was
severely damaged and left uninhabitable by Hurricane Jeanne in late
2004.  Since then I have been having it repaired, with the intent to use
the rent from it to supplement my pension and Social Security after I
retire.

Despite the fact that it was not - and still is not - habitable, the
Brevard County Tax Assessor levied a 45% property tax increase on it
last year, and I was recently notified that they will be increasing the
property tax on it by another 29% this year.  My calls to the local tax
assessor's office to discuss my situation were fruitless.  Since I will
be losing money on it due to these new taxes even after it is repaired
and rentable, I am now forced to sell it and invest my money in another
state.

I was planning to move to Florida later this year after I retire from
the Boeing Company in California.  I love Florida and I always thought
of it as a retiree-friendly state that had a lot to offer.   However,
due to the out-of-control property taxing authorities in your state I
now realize that moving to Florida is no longer feasible for me.  In
addition to needing my condo's rental income to supplement my Boeing
pension and Social Security, I need to live in a state where property
taxes on my primary residence are reasonable and stable.  Obviously this
is no longer the case in Florida, or at least in Brevard County.

What is ironic in all this is that I suspect I am the kind of person you
would want to come to Florida and invest in Florida's economy.  I was
going to purchase a new house there with the equity from my home in
California. I would have bought furniture, appliances, autos, paid sales
taxes and property taxes and at the same time used relatively few state
services.  I have full medical insurance from Boeing, and no children to
use your schools and libraries.  I likely would have injected several
million dollars into Florida's economy and tens of thousands of tax
dollars into your state treasury over the remainder of my lifetime.  

I realize you do not control property taxes, and I am sure this is not
the first time you have heard a story like this, but hopefully if enough
taxpayers address this issue something may be done about it, although it
will be too late for me.

Dear Governor Bush,
Please call a special session so the legislators will come up with rates and a risk level that the insurance companies can accept.    In my opinion, we are in a real-estate insurance crisis and not enough has been done to solve the problem.
 
For background, we live in St Petersburg and have some rental houses (single family).  All of our hazard policies are being canceled which means we will have to go to Citizens.   Our rates will increase by 350% which will increase our costs  by  thousands a year.  
 
Thank you for all that you have done and your consideration of this matter.

Jeb Bush, 
 
I appreciate you giving the public a way to email you with there concerns. I have been a Bay Co. property owner for 11 years and have lots of FL friends. My property taxes in 2004 were $759. , in 2005 $1305.(a 72% increase), and this year's TRIM notice indicates that my tax bill could increase to nearly $5,000 ( another 400% tax increase). When Rick Barnett was asked , he stated that the State of FL was forcing him to bring the tax values up to market values. There has been a tremendous amount of "flipping" real estate and the price is totally unrealistic. This is targeting the older single family homes in Bay Co. that have been the backbone of the county for 50+ years and now these are the ones being hurt the most. I was under the impression that taxes were raised due to three reasons 1. The use of the property changed (ie residential to commercial property), 2. Major property improvements, or  3. Sale of the property for a new value. In most cases, none of these three things have happened. It seems like the stable, one family homes that are left are going to be taxed out of existance. Would you please help keep Bay Co and FL a stable place for single families to own property.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Thank you for everything you have done for Floridians over the past 8 years.  We know you have worked hard to make this a better place to live.  I know it has not been easy for you with all the hurricanes we have had recently.  I hope that Charlie Crist will be our next governor and keep up the good work,  I will certainly vote for him.
 
There are two things that most Floridians are concerned about though, one is our homeowners insurance and the other is our property taxes.
 
We were insured with Poe Financial (Southern Family) who went into liquidation and now we of course have to go with Citizens.  Our policy expires on October 21st and will increase from a little over $800 per year to $3500, now that is a remarkable increase.  To bring the cost down, we can choose to go with a $2000 deductible and if we are hit by a hurricane it will be 5% of the cost.  Our home is assessed at $255,000 and Citizens is saying that our replacement value would be $235,000 which means they would get over $11,000 as a deductible in case of a hurricane.  Now everyone knows that if your house is destroyed and has to be replaced you still have your land which could be worth up to $50,000 or $60,000.  These people are just ripping us off.  If we decide to sell our home and move to a smaller home (our children have all left home now) our property tax will go up to about 3 times as much as we are paying now.  What do we do?  That is the big question.
 
Governor Bush, I know this is not your fault and I know that you will soon be leaving office but I sure wish something could be done to help us.  My husband is 61 and I will be 60 this year, we were hoping to retire in a few years and at least enjoy some years before we die.  We have 4 children and have struggled over the years.  My husband is a cabinet maker and I am a secretary, we are not wealthy people but we have worked hard over the years to give our children a better life and now it is our turn to try and enjoy a little of the time we have left.  We probably will never be able to retire if we have to pay out these costs.  We don't want to move out of Florida because our children all live here and we love it, but we might be forced to leave.  Surely there is something someone can do to help? 
 
I know, like your brother the President, you are a compassionate person and I know you are doing the best you can but please make this the number one priority before you leave office.  If the democrats get in they will raise our taxes then what will we do.  
 
Thanks for listening and good luck to you in your future endeavors.  I am sure you will succeed in whatever you do.  You are a good person and have been a great Governor.
 
Sincerely,

P.S. I was not able to find Charlie Crist's e-mail address on your web-site, I took a stab at one but in case it is incorrect I would appreciate if he could be cc'd on this.  I know many people who will be anxious to find out what he plans to do about these issues before they cast their vote in November.  I think he will make a great Governor and he will get my vote regardless.

Governor Bush,


This text was relayed to our county commissioners by me in Sarasota county at the commission meeting in Venice on 9/11/06.
There answer was that they had sympathy and could do nothing to help and that we should contact our legislators. This pass the buck attitude creates a "Throw the Bums Out" atmosphere. Your help in this unjust tax system is desperately needed. This is a grave problem though out the state of Florida and should require more than a form letter response.

Thank you Patrick Moriarity

My name is Patrick Moriarity and I have been a resident of Venice for 30 years and a business owner for 28 years before retiring. As a business owner, I quickly learned that I had no choice but to pass on any raises in taxes to the consumer. I currently own commercial rental property in Venice. And in 2003 my taxes on that property was raised by 24%.  Now, in 2006  the proposed tax increase is another 35%. 

These proposed taxes for commercial property go beyond the concept of fair taxes for all and
do nothing less than create a back door tax that every consumer in Sarasota County will have to pay. It will also contribute to the long standing problem of affordable housing. 

If the proposed property tax increase is enacted, you will find that our residents will not be able to afford to rent our homes ....................

They will not be able to afford the rent it costs to operate a business. 

Along with the skyrocketing cost of insurance 
$100.00  and even  $200.00  a month raises in rents will become the norm.

There are tools in place to assure that these raises will not happen. 
You, for the most part are our elected tools.
The voters of Sarasota County are counting on you to step in and use them right.

Stratisferic raises of 30, 35 and 40% tax increases are immoral and deserve to be re-evaluated.


I for one am asking you to manage the finances with what you got......... And not with what you want.

Thank you

Dear Mr. Governor,
Here is to hoping you actually read and answer your own email.
It seems there is no one elected from Pinellas County who wants to let you 
know what Pinellas County property owners think of the current legislation 
regarding Florida Homestead, Florida Home Valuations as a process and 
property tax cap equity for all Florida residents not just homestead 
properties.  I am sure you will agree with me when I say the demographic of 
Florida has changed over the past few years especially Pinellas and 
Hillsborough Counties and very likely many others.  I would like to think it 
has changed for the positive and the you had a lot to do with that change.  
I am part of that change in demographic and happy to say I live in Florida.

I know you are leaving office, but you have not left yet and I know you are 
just can't wait to hear about all of this.  Given elected officials appear 
to be too timid to mention all of this I thought I might just do it for them 
and the rest of Pinellas County.  I have sent this to the Pinellas County 
Property Tax Appraiser who has responded with political double speak, all of 
the County Commissioners who sympathize but want to get back to whatever 
they were doing before I raised the issue so here I am speaking to you 
hoping you care enough to listen and do something for the citizens of 
Pinellas County and potentially many other Counties and citizens in the 
state of Florida.

Dear Mr. Somers,
I agree with you completely.  I am hoping that we not only will lower the 
taxes but will make the cap on property values and/or different methods of 
property assessment other than "highest and best use" one of our top 
lobbyiing priorities to Tallahassee.
However, the state legislators need to hear from you all and the citizens to 
know how horrible it has become.

Thanks for being involved and caring,

Mr. Welch,
Thank you for replying to my email.  I wanted to be absolutely clear that
the residents of Pinellas are not only unhappy with mill rate adjustments
but we are are totally upset with the discriminatory state law that protects
homestead residents to the tune of a 3 percent property tax hike but not
other residents.  It is as if you are saying if your property is not covered
by homestead then it is open season on that resident and that is completely
and utterly discriminatory.  The Homestead $25K reduction in home valuation
is one thing but the cap is another.  Your assumptions regarding
affluence and those residents who do not qualify for homestead are 
completely wrong.
All home owners in Pinellas are responsible for the tax burden and treating
one owner significantly different than another is highly discriminatory.  If
you are telling me I need to write the governor to carry this message to
Tallahassee I will but I am asking you and your colleagues to help as well.

Terence Somers

Dear Mr. Somers:


Thank you for your email. Your sentiments were shared by many Pinellas
County residents at last Thursday's County Commission public hearing on the
2006-07 budget. Although I was required to attend a canvassing board meeting
that evening (due to a mandatory vote recount), I did view much of the
County Commission hearing via streaming video. As is always the case, Vice
Chairman Duncan and the Commission listened to the issues and concerns
expressed by the public.

Please be assured that your County Commission is very concerned with
developing real solutions to the tax inequities that are affecting
non-homesteaded property owners. At the conclusion of the public hearing,
the Commission asked staff to bring back options for further reducing our
millage, beyond the 3% millage reduction that was recommended in the
tentative millage and budget. I anticipate that the Commission will pass a
significantly reduced budget at our final public hearing on September 19th.

It is worth repeating Vice Chairman Duncan's statement that regardless of
which option the Commission chooses, we can only address a fraction of the
tax, valuation and insurance crisis that is affecting property owners
throughout the state. We will need your continued, passionate advocacy, at
both the local and state levels. As we move through this election season, it
is imperative that you advocate your position to other taxing authorities
(municipalities, school board, etc.), candidates and elected State
legislators, and candidates for Governor. The County Commission is committed
to being part of the solution, but we can only provide a partial solution
through millage reductions.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts with the Board of County Commissioners. We
are listening.

Ken

Subject: Pinellas County Outrageous Property tax Scandal



This  information is the result of an online customer service form
submission from the Pinellas County web site.
message_text Commissioners,

I have to complain vehemently about your proposed increases in property tax
millage rates for the coming year.  Per your figures the budget is
increasing by 11.78%, but my taxes (without millage changes) are going up
45% this year alone and it was substantial last year as well.  Something is
wrong with this picture.  My taxes have doubled since 2004 and my property
value has gone down.  The PCPAO is completely clued out asleep at their
desks as this takes place assessing homes they have never even seen using
real estate sales as a benchmark!  How absolutely stupid could they be!
Surely the millage rates should be adjusting downward, to reflect the
counties increasing collections due to our growing property values, not up
to be spent on additional projects.


I absolutely emplore you to reconsider your actions.  You are literally
running people out of their homes and it is spiteful.


Background info that set me off in this direction:

Per a recent St Pete Times article 8/19/06:

"Property insurance rates doubling. Gas prices topping $3 a gallon. Trash
bills, water bills, electric bills - all going up.

Whatever it is, it seems to cost more these days.

Don't expect your local government to help.

Cities, counties and school boards across Tampa Bay are using your money to
grow at record rates, sucking in huge increases in property tax revenues and
in return offering only marginal cuts to the tax rate, if any.

It has become a shrewd political maneuver in this era of robust property
growth. Politicians can tout new parks or libraries and cut your tax rate.
But the bottom line is, you're paying more. Much more.

Since 2001, the size of local government across the area has nearly doubled.
Five years ago, the city of Tampa took in $97.7-million in property tax
revenues. This year, it expects to collect $167.7-million, an increase of
almost 72 percent. The city of Clearwater's property tax revenues
skyrocketed 85 percent in the same time.

With all that extra money, what did you get?"

"People live on a budget. And when the budget gets tight, people have to
tighten their belt," said Hillsborough County Commissioner Brian Blair, who
has pushed his government for substantial spending cuts. "Government should
be no different. But for some reason, it plays by different rules."

You cannot seem to get the concept of taxation and appropriate
representation correct.  You have policies in place such as homestead and
save our homes that protect some homeowners but not others.  Policies that
cap increases in valuation at 3 percent or inflation whichever works best
for you for some homeowners but not others.  This is all very bad business
for a region that is changing it's demographics and a County Commission that
is completely and utterly asleep at the switch.  In case you hadn't noticed
this is not a retirement locale only anymore and has not been few several
years.  Corporations would like to locate here and know that the County
knows how to construct a road (not like mal-function junction the laughing
item of the entire civil engineering community or US19 between Gulf to Bay
and Tampa Road) , build schools where appropriate and implement fair and
equitable taxation by representation schemes.

I have contacted the Attorney General of The State of Florida to look into
the absolutely scandalous activities  with respect to property taxes,
valuation and millage in this county. We are not happy with you today at
all.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I’m a 70 year old retiree living in Palm Beach County, for 24 years, in a homesteaded property.  We would like to downsize but would not be able to afford the increase in property tax.  I am sure that I am not alone in this predicament.  Our younger would-be property owners are also being squeezed, including out teachers, police, and blue collar workers on which we all depend.  Over the last few years home prices have seen significant increase, yielding windfalls in government mandated property taxes.  On top of this, the Florida Insurance Industry in now in a crisis and many people just cannot afford to live here.  All of this I am sure you know; what do you plan to do to solve these problems before you leave office?

 

I remain your Republican friend,

Hello Governor Bush, I have emailed before about these issues and appreciated the suggestions given by your assistant. I have contacted my elected official about this issue and hopefully our  soon to be elected legislators will immediately work on tax issues and insurance. 
 
We have emailed your task force and hope they are listening. A cap on NON HOMESTEAD property valuation increases must occur to keep FL  real estate market healthy.
 
We purchased our "dream lot" in 2004 when it had annual taxes of $1700. Then in 2005, taxes went to $5300 per year. We took pause and thought we'd be able to get our "dream home" built on the lot prior to tax year 2006. Due to the building frenzy here in 2005, it took much longer than we'd ever imagined to get house plans finalized and bids in from builders. We were ready to break ground last week, but now our new TRIM notice shows our vacant lot to be $8900 proposed taxes!  A valuation cap would have made a huge difference for us. Once a house would be built, the taxes would be more than double that amount. 
 
Our "dream home" hopes are likely now squashed. We are not breaking ground to build now, but  will consider such if the valuations are reduced and the insurance situation is under control. If nothing is done to lower taxes on the state and county level, we have no choice but to sell this lot (though no properties here in this county are selling our realtor tells us) and find another part of the USA to live our retirement. We are willing to endure hurricanes and flocks of tourists 4 months of the year; we cannot afford to pay outrageous property taxes and outrageous insurance premiums too.   There are MANY others we know in this same situation. Please help!

Dear Gov. Bush,
I have been a supporter of yours and believe you to be a fair man.  I along 
with a city of people have homes in Mexico Beach Florida.  The  new proposed 
taxes we received is causing panic here.  I have owned this property since 
1977 and planned to retire here.  During 2004-05 with low interst rates 
people with big money bought up much of the property here, building 
condominiums right and left many of which have never sold.  My house is one 
of the original homes in Mexico Beach, built in 1956 and we have done very 
little to it since then.  My neighbor has had their house forsale for over a 
year and reduced the price twice and still it has not sold.  I do not 
believe anyone can think this is fair taxation.  I know several retired 
people living here and they will loose their homes because they can not 
afford the high taxes imposed on them.  Does this seem just to you?  We have 
worked hard to reach this point in our lives and now it appears we will not 
be living our American Dream as we approach retirement.  I am disabled my 
husband has semi-retired and we will have to mortgage our house to pay the 
tax then worry about that payment and doing the same the next year.  Please 
help us get something passed in Tallahassee that will lower our tax to a 
more favorable figure we can all live with and before this tax deadline.  
Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
    My name is Bernice Acree-Sims; I am a student at Hillsborough Community College.  As I was reviewing your A + + Plan for education, it occurred to me that although your plan is very impressive.  I can see in one area that I really did not understand the 4.6 million you are using to create a professional development and recognition program for principals.  I think we can use some of that money towards the 1.3 million you allocated to expanding the Department of Educations recruitment and retention initiatives.I know principals are important but so are the teachers we entrust to educate our children and I feel the government is not paying the teachers the salary they deserve thereby ultimately losing excellent educators to other careers, which in some cases leaving the children with teachers that don't care.  This is something I felt needed to be addressed.  I would like to say that you are one of the finest state administrators that I ever had the pleasure of being governed by, and I  hope in the future after your retirement as governor you would look into improving the lot of public school teachers throughout the state of Florida.

Dear Mr. Bush

I came to Florida in Nov. 2000 based on a working visa.

I applied for the green card in early 2001.

To process took over 4 years and I got the green card in May 2005.

I applied for homestead exemption which I got accepted for 2006 – but the 3 % cap does not apply

until one year later – meaning 2007.

I am a working resident since 2001 – paying taxes and live full time in my

primary home.

My property taxes went up from $4,568.69 in 2001 to $10,302.66 in 2006.

Does this seem right to you?

Is there a way to petition on this?

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am republican and I voted for your brother George  in both elections as well as for your father. I was not living in Florida when you ran for election or I would have voted for you as well.
 
I am a dedicated Republican and believe in the philosophies of the Republican party.
 
However, I do have a concern over the abnormal property tax increased proposed for Volusia County and therefore, need your help.
 
I just moved here last October from New Jersey. I am a 41 year old white married woman. My company transferred me to Florida.  The tax proposed for 2006/2007 is higher than what I was paying in New Jersey.  The increase represents a 200% increase to me personally.
I cannot afford this additional expense.  When I moved here, I was told that moving to Florida would offer a better quality of life and a lower cost of living. Everything has been fine, up until the proposed Volusia Count Tax increase was proposed.  My homeowners insurance is being increased by 100%.
 
I implore you to get in touch with the Volusia county tax payers and find out what is happening and reach out to the County Council of Volusia county to reverse this situation.
 
The first public hearing was September 7th in Deland. The turnout was terrific. Local residents and business owners voiced their opinions.   Local residents are unable to pay these proposed taxes and many people said they would have to move out of the state of Florida in order to be able survive financially. 
 
Do you want people to leave this beautiful state of Florida? One man said in his neighborhood alone of 17 houses, 13 are for sale.  There is a significant problem here if people are moving away because the property tax is out of control. I don't think the County Council knows how to balance a budget properly.  I suggested they contact Rudy Giuliani for advice. I was being serious.  He turned NYC around and I am certain he would be happy to help a small government town like the Volusia County Council.
 
I know this is your last term and you may not have too much concern over this matter, but do the right thing and turn this ship around. Help the residents and tax payers of Volusia county so that they can live where they want to and enjoy the wonderful life that the state of Florida has to offer.
 
The next public hearing for this matter is scheduled for September 21st. It is my understanding that Chairman Frank Bruno will be announcing the final Tax increase.  Can you please reach out to him before then.
 
Please help us.

Hello James,

 

I am very frustrated with the lack of response of my previous e-mail.  I plan to send this certified mail to Representatives, Senators and the Governor’s office as I have yet in the past to even receive a reply from their offices.  

 

How does one get heard these days?

Dear Governor, Representatives, Senators, local Officials, Property Appraisers, and Media

 

Subject: SOH Amendment needs to be accelerated, and for this broken down in SEPARATE amendments as well as possible additional EXECUTIVE ORDERS from the Governor so as to take effect in 2007 (possibly even in 2006 for a certain group) as Florida can’t wait for 2008!

 

Following the recent show of the “Tax Coalition” last Thursday in the Volusia County chamber, it is clear that the train for Tax Reform is in full motion.  However, the proposed county budget is only one piece of the equation; the other main component to our tax bill computation is our Assessed Values.  The way Assessed Values are computed, allowing huge discount from Just Values to some and not to others, is a system that is flawed, unfair to many, and finally being exposed to the public.  The veil of the old “secrecy” has been pierced and neighbors now compare their tax bills thanks to the internet and readily available access to county Tax Rolls.  The system needs to and will be changed.  While this is also being addressed now by various Bills in the House and Senate, and the duty of the recently appointed Property Tax Reform Committee, most of the public is not aware of the problems and what is being proposed by various Senators and Representatives.  More importantly the public is unaware that the process of change may not take place until 2008!  So, WE FACE TWO MORE YEARS OF HEAVY TAXATION unless both the Mileage drops and the Assessed Values are rectified to many.

 

This is a subject that is not widely understood and very much of actuality.  I dare to say that nothing is more important at the moment for Florida than to maintain the "liquidity" of its Real Estate.   With the current and increased struggle Florida residents are having with their property taxes, home insurance, and hurricane prevention expenditures over the past 2 years, the News Journal and other Medias need to inform objectively, positively, and effectively about the ongoing battle and efforts to reform Property taxes.  The needs to make Real Estate Property Taxes equitable, and more importantly, ease up Real Estate Taxes for families moving their homestead within the State have been recently pointed out by the governor in his Executive Order number 06-141 dated June 21,2006.  I am glad to see that the right of all Florida residents to pay fair taxes is finally recognized and addressed at the top level.  The governor points out among other issues the current imbalance, discrimination, and special needs of first time Homeowners.  But as far as Homestaeders moving within Florida, this matter should be TO PRIORITY as the injustice hurts these groups the most.  Additionally, thousands of Florida residents are trapped into their homes as they can not SELL them

 

Florida can't simply wait till Dec 1, 2007 to grant RELIEF to that SPECIFIC group!  

 

Please read on, but first check this link for the actual text of the order and info about the commission: http://www.propertytaxreform.state.fl.us/default.htm

 

Others like me involved in Real Estate and who understands the issues at stake, we are "sounding the alarm"!  We can't wait until Dec 1. 2007 for the recently appointed commission by the governor to report "its findings and make suggestions".  This is not a complicated matter like some conservative politicians make it appear. 

 

The Real Solution is to isolate the three main issues being looked into namely "making Real Estate Taxes equitable between neighbors", "Tax abatement for first time homebuyers" and "portability for Floridians who wish to move their homestead" and look at them individually and take care of them separately!  Each should be the subject of its own amendment.  

 

The portability issue for example is easy to deal with.  A positive change would immediately "defrost" the market and should therefore be top priority.   Because it is the lack of portability, second only to the first time homebuyer issue that puts strains on the market by preventing homeowners to sell their homes. There is a simple solution to the problem like allowing people with homestead to move to a different property and carry with them the RATIO between "Just" and "Assessed", a measure of the break they have earned over the years.  Since most people move to a home of higher value when they move, their tax bill will be higher than at the previous location and ultimately there is no loss of revenue to the counties.  The Status Quo is intolerable for Florida Homesteaders "on the move" that are currently discriminated against and "trapped" into their homes.  This, because the proposed tax bill at a new location can go up as much as 5 times as the one at the previous home.   For example, a family moving from a $200K home where they lived in the past 5 years, and where the current RE Taxes may be as low as $2,000 face a huge dilemma.  This is because their "Assessed value" was capped at 3% at their location from a low assessment of say $100K at time of purchase.  But, if that same family acquires a home in the $300K to the $350K range (pretty much the norm these days), then the new bill is $7,500 due to the loss of the discount we all get by the old SOH amendment of 1992.  For many families this differential of $5,500 is cost prohibitive and a deal killer in Real estate! 

 

So, if it is easy, let's deal with this NOW!  Why should we wait for that issue to be resolved to deal with the ones directly affecting our Real Estate LIQUIDITY?  The Inequity issue does not affect the marketability of Real Estate (at least as directly) as it only deals with the correction process needed so that the "assessed value" between taxpayers living in similar homes at similar locations becomes equitable.  Everyone knows this is not presently the case.  Without any doubt much work will be needed to undo the unfairness created by SOH.  But "Portability" and "First time homebuyer" issues are easy to correct and should not see much opposition.  These are good measures fueling our Florida economy! So why wait so long?  

I call on the officials, the press, other Realtors and elected Representatives and Senators to impress upon the governor the need for additional executive orders.  Let’s deal with the pressing matters NOW for 2006 Tax season!   Let’s leave the issue of inequity between neighbors due to the differential caused by "Save our Homes" (SOH) amendment enacted in 1994 to the new commission.  This is a much more complex issue and a much bigger one.  It will raise the most controversy and will require time to correct.  Perhaps even a referendum?

 

Let’s get rid of this "new mortgage" on some properties imposed by the counties and the State of Florida on some of its residents.  This was UNPLANNED by SOH, and inequities has become extremely UNFAIR to “first time Owners” and “Movers”!  All Floridian with Homestead should have the same right to the differential between "Just" and "Assessed".   This problem was created by the legislators in 1994, or the then SOH committee, who could not predict that property values would increase exponentially in the last 5 years and certainly beyond the 3% Cap created by SOH?  But one should assume that the cap was to protect all Floridians! Then why leave out their fundamental right to those that move their homestead within the state? Removing the tax break after their move is unfair and really doing nothing about it NOW is OUTRAGEOUS!  The right SOH was trying to protect, was most certainly meant to be "IN PERSONA" therefore OWNED by the Homesteader, and not related or attached to "THE REAL PROPERTY ADDRESS!  This would not make any sense!  The problem is THAT IS THE WAY THE TAX ASSESSORS INTEERPRET THE TEXT OF SOH!   THIS IS WRONG!  That "break" which Homesteaders earn over time should not be taken back when they moves!  Or we are going to have a war between those that move and those that stay put for many years. Come on! 

 

 Now that I am thinking about this, I am even questioning and concerned to know whether the current discrimination is possibly and illegal and unconstitutional (Florida Constitution) and  should be possibly challenged all the way to the Florida Supreme Court.  Certainly, all of us should have the same right!  So, should those affected adversely by SOH complain to the Tax Assessor and seek relief?   Or even sue the state for discrimination?  Probably not, but I think the County Assessor should be more lenient to those who contribute "beyond the call of duty" to the Tax Roll and not bluntly apply an unjust formula which we all know will eventually be repealed. 

To those affected (recent movers in 2005) I say file a petition by the September 13 deadline and let's get the ball rolling!  It cost only $15, and the form is available in all County offices.  Remember; ask for preferential treatment since your neighboors have it!  I am not joking, do it and document it!  This is the only way we are going to see changes any time soon.  Hopefully, the Property Appraisers and their depuites will make special exceptions to the 2006 (and 2007?) tax rolls.  It is the right thing to do and hopefully you can get a break.  If not, go argue with the Value Adjustment Board, and all the way to the County Councils if needed.  They know the whole darn thing is unfair and has been so for the past 5 years!  

Obviously the text of SOH had many loopholes adversely affecting some. Let’s hope that the governor was diligent in the selection of the committee this time.  Indeed, this matter of Property Taxes affects 18 millions Floridians according to his order!  So, clearly, this portability RELIEF is only a correction to reinstate civil rights and Floridians affected should not have to wait 2 more years!   

 

I call on the County Appraisers to be lenient towards those affected this tax season.  It is obvious to me that they are aware of the problems but do not know how to deal with it having fear of granting favors to some against the others.  Well, the real problem is that the old homestaders are not paying their fair "market share" of taxes and they are the ones getting the favors of the Tax assessors by virtue of SOH!  Is that normal and equitable?  It is clear that the injustices will eventually be cured.  The problem is when? 2008?  In my view, the County Assessors should be granted temporary rights by another immediate Executive Order to give a break now to those that moved in 2004 and 2005.  It is only good business and fair to correct a loophole in SOH.  Tax Assessor’s review can be monitored for possible Fraud.  This immediate cure should be welcome by all because the families that moved their homestead, should be compensated and not PENALIZED.  This will incite people to sell and purchase properties.  By the way, few people are aware of the fact that the counties “double dip” when someone moves their homestead to another Florida location.  The old property address is sold and tax paid by the new homeowner there (either existing Homesteader from Florida, or from foreign States/Countries), nearly double/triple each time.   Meanwhile the taxes at the new home always double/triple too!   Yes, Floridians on the move, you are currently treated like "furners".  This is NUTS!  As long as their new property is of a higher value why do counties not give a break!  What do we need to make this happen and grant them the power?  2 more years? How about if bills get a NO vote in the Senate?  Governor Bush, can you do something about this?

Additionally, further provisions need to be put in place for retirees downsizing that are finding their tax bill has increased.  They are not protected under the system either.  IOW, the status is: Don't Move!  Now, is this good for our Real Estate Market?  

 

IMHO, the increase in RE taxes, compounded by the recent increase in Home insurance rates, and the overall increase in cost of living, is going to take a huge dent in the Florida Real Estate and Economy in 4th quarter of 2006, worsen in 2007 and be intolerable to some in 2008.  The signs are already there:  The MLS systems are at record high with over 6,200 residential listings in the Daytona Beach Area.  Add the FSBO’s and the units under construction, and we possibly have 20,000 units on the market, indeed an unprecedented amount.  This is GRAVE, especially for the construction business which will enter into a huge crisis. Worse, it is reasonable to predict possible massive foreclosures and unemployment if we do not ease up the "liquidity" of Real Estate transactions.  The market is "frozen right now" and unless we inform that there will be relief soon, things will escalate. 

Recent articles and letter sent by Morgan Gilreath, our Property Appraiser, do help inform.  Both his "Understanding Your Property Tax" letter sent with the recent TRIM notices, and his Aug 27 article in Community Voices are to be congratulated.  But, he is the Property Appraiser representing Government and has to apply the Florida Laws regulating real estate.  He currently does have the ability but not the authority to correct inadequacies.  We are the taxpayers and we need to support any grass root movement to correct a terrible situation.  This means supporting the Volusia Tax Reform Group, our representatives (make sure they read and reply our e-mails) ask for more views, opinions and suggestions from the public.  For this to happen, we need the Medias to DRIVE this effort.  For example, the public reads about the word "portability" (in Mr. Gilreath’s letter) for the first time ever, but aside for its definition nothing is mentioned of What, When, How will new taxes be computed?  More importantly, will it be retroactive? How many years?   

 

Right now it is our Government that decides this, and the residents of Florida need to get the grip on these major issues that affect them to avoid another SOF Fiasco. 

I firmly believe that our future as far as Real Estate Property Taxation should be decided by the Florida residents at large i.e.: BY REFERENDUM!   Not in the hands of politicians, and certainly not in the hands of those that were involved with SOH in 1992 when the SOH amendment was voted on. :-(  

 

Please do research the matter and use whatever influence you may have to impress our legislators, the Governor, the Property Tax Reform Committee, and above all the public to accelerate the process.  

 

Respectfully,

Dear Governor,

Please help us, my family and all the people I work with. We received or Tax Notices (TRIM NOTICE) and we cannot believe what is happening to us. Our property taxes have risen so greatly that we are at a loss. My personal property tax on a little 2 bedroom condominium in Hollywood, Florida has risen 300% for this next year. This relates to an additional $500.00 per month I need to pay just for this property tax increase. I cannot afford this at all and my fellow workers are all being faced with the same increases. We don't have any money to pay these increases and we cannot even sell our homes now.

You must please help us and stop this increase immediately. Just put a stop on it so we can  figure out what we can do to survive here. We just need time to assess what we are going to do before you allow this type of increase to go through. This came as a total surprise to us and we are not prepared for it.

I would sincerely like to speak with you along with my fellow workers and explain our dilemma. Not just with Property Taxes which is the most devastating item right now but with Health Care, Home Owners Insurance, Low Incomes because we cannot compete in this World Market, etc. I do not want to go into all the details in this e-mail because I know you have many items on your agenda but what I do ask is that you take a moment and respond to me so we know something can be worked out. Time is running out and if you wait or do not respond before the deadline it will be TOO LATE as Lori Parrish (Broward County Property Appraiser) states it.

Sincerely,

Mark Stevenson

I will start this by saying you are on the right track. I have been working on a Rating Plan for Florida Property Insurance for several years based on that same premise but to be successful, the plan has to have proven facts as to its effectiveness. That takes time and research. The DOI got mad at the carrier I was developing the concept and put it into Rehab. I have continued to work on the concept because I think it is better than the present approach. 
 
After saying the above, I have serious reservations with your Task Force. They are not insurance professionals and particularly insurance engineers. I am afraid that you are making the same mistake that all the other Florida government groups have made - ask the legislature to enact Law requiring unproven technology! I had hope for better from you. You are the only member of your family that I have ever supported (long and complicated story). Why not do it right and enlist the aid of the insurance industry to prove the value of these recommendations. Otherwise I fear you are going to drive more insurance capacity away from Florida than resolve the problem. 
 
Attached is a letter that I sent to the DOI Risk Management Division. That might not be the correct place to send such a letter but it should be. Maybe your endorsed future Florida Chief Financial Officer could become involved. The old near did!

In 2004 my tax obligation was approximately $360.00, in 2005 it was $722, for 2006 is approximately $1,184 to $1,387, this is getting out of hand, my retirement is in approximately 4 to 5 years at this rate I will not be able to afford this property.

Mr Barnett,

I’ve attempted all day to get in contact with your office and I’ve gotten a busy signal all day (2 days running). I’ve just received a letter I’m sure you have received from the Laguna Beach homeowners association and agree with it 100%. In summary it states:

1)  There are many inconsistent appraisals within Bay County. In fact I’ve reviewed appraisals (see email below) as well as reviewed the last few months of home sales listed on your web site which agree with this statement.

2) Assessments appear to be based on the 2005 prices when prices were at their peak and selling at a premium. If one were to look at the current market one would see numerous homes for sale and folks are even dropping their selling prices tens of thousands of dollars.

3) Assessments should be rolled back to the 2004 tax yr. I agree with this statement 100%

4) … the stated market prices are over inflated and there has been a major recession in the market…..

 

It extremely frustrating to try for the last 2 days to call your office and continue to get a busy signal, yet its amazing that at 5pm the lines clear and you get the recording that the office is closed. I’ve pulled down the petition off the web site yet am not sure what needs to go in some of these areas.  It would have been nice to talk with someone and discuss this. I’m getting ready to go TDY (military business) for the next 15 days, so will have to fill out your petition, of which some questions are vague and need some clarification. 

 

I’ve cc the Gov Bush and Lt Gov Jennings In hopes that maybe they can have someone investigate the items listed above as well as why appraisals in the area have shot up in excess of 200% in 2 yrs according to your appraisal yet if one were to drive though the Panama City beach area there numerous homes on the market (5-6 per street) in our area an none are getting close to what you appraised value and they are not selling. In fact I’d like them to look into the zoning policies but that’s a bay county commissioners issue why they allowed parts of panama city beach to be zoned as panama city and I’m not talking areas around the panama city beach/panama city line I’m talking how one can have a zoning for panama city in the center of panama city beach… I would even recommend to Gov Bush that if this is going to be the norm of raising values at ridiculous rates that the state look into capping the amount the appraiser can raise home values (maybe 8-10%/yr max).

 

 

Sincerely

Bob Tetla

 

I’ll be out of town but if you would like to discuss this with my wife her work number is 850-884-5587.  If need be she can get a hold of me at Sheppard AFB if you would like me to contact you but I need a good number that is not consistently busy and it would have to be around lunch.

Mr Barnett,

I find it extremely frustrating that this yr my property value has jumped from 116,611 to 371,923 (219%). Our parcel id is 36689-000-000 or 128 14th St in Panama City Beach.

The house is a 1960 2 bdr, 1 bath block home that is on septic. Looking though various articles it appears the county is taking ridiculous jumps on these appraisals.

In fact looking at some of the various web sites. Here is one such listing:

 

 Address           Date     Price          Bed/ Bath     Sq

                                                                         Feet     Lot

Here is a home up the street from us with 2769 sq feet and it has a TAX VALUE OF 314,250, yet our 900 sq foot home your taxing at 371,926? It doesn’t make sense. I getting ready to write the state and complain about how ridiculous this is.  With all the property on the marker today (non of which are selling to and infact I’ve seen numerous properties reduced by quite a lot) I can’t understand how you all came up with our appraisal price. I’ve gotten a response back from Ms Brannon who directed me to you.

 

I’d like to hear your side on why these appraisals are coming in so high.  Before I press this issue up the chain to Tallahassee long with the growth plan that appears to favor the big builders, I’d like to hear your side.

I have been in Florida for two years now, having moved from Michigan.  I had information that the property taxes in Florida were out of control but almost $8,000.00 per year on a $280,000.00 house is more than out of control it's completely unacceptable and ridiculous. What is being done?

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to you to request your help in making St. Lucie County a more
affordable place to live.  I have lived in Port St. Lucie for approximately
24 years and have seen it grow incredibly over the last few years.  Property
values have increased dramatically, which may be a good thing, except if you
want to move.  I've lived in my current home for nearly 9 years.  I
purchased it for $75,000 and today it is valued at over $200K.  Wonderful,
you might say.  Problem is, I'm currently building a new home because the
street I live on has become too busy for my liking and I have no privacy
across my backyard.  Now I am faced with a huge increase in property taxes
for the next house.  I've heard word that there was something in process to
allow existing home owners to move within the same town and take their tax
base with them so that they would pay taxes on the new house based on their
old house or something to that affect.  Is there anything like that in the
works???

Over the last 6 months or so, I have seen a lot of families leave Florida
and move to places like Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, etc because housing is
so much cheaper, taxes are much lower and Insurance is much lower.  I am
afraid that if we continue on the path we are on, there will be a mass
exodus out of Florida merely because people can no longer afford to live
here.  To me, I live in paradise and I want to continue to live here.  What
I don't understand is that the population of Port St. Lucie has grown
tremendously.  You could cut taxes in half and still be ahead of the game
because of the volume of houses paying those taxes.  And yes, I realize PSL
has lowered the millage rate, but with home values rising it doesn't make
any impact at all.  We need help!!!

Subject:	Homestead Exemption TRAPS one into their home

Thanks for your present/past service. Would appreciate your passing SOH exemption to allow seniors to downsize and sell homes with SOH exemption and transfer this accumulated benefit to a new less expensive home in same county retroactive to all of 2006 transactions. In our 70's, sold our home in 2006  (we bought 10 years ago) and bought new condo  in 2006 at 1/2 price of home to get cash to live on - but property taxes now more than in prior home because we now must start all over with a new   homestead application etc. Without change to transfer this benefit  people will have to move back North-which may be what some want? Thanks for your help. Bill Dieter Naples  Fl.

Subject:	Property Tax Control

I support any efforts to control the runaway property tax increases we are seeing.
On our property in Mexico Beach, Florida, which we plan on retiring to in several years, our tax has increased 200% in three years. Why do our local governments need these types of increases? I don't believe any other entity has realized close to these types of increases (inflation +10%, salary increases = +12%). 
I believe it is time to bring some common sense back into this process including:

*	Homestead cap portability (alleviate the situation where someone is trapped in their home because if they move the new assessment will bankrupt them) 
*	Limit a taxing authorities budget increase (local government's should not be allowed to make unlimited property tax increases). 
*	Use a 3 to 5 year moving average for assessed values of a property (this would avoid the situation that is occurring this year where a frnzied buy and flip market has resulted in assessed property values nearly doubling in one year. The resulting tax burden is, of course, going to be shouldered by the property owners who intend to actually stay and live, not the ones who got in and out at the peak of the market.) 
*	Cap non-homestead property (we purchased a modest 1100 ft2 house on a 1/4 acre lot in which we plan to retire. Since we purchased this in 2002 our property tax has gone from $1100 to $4800. If this increases any more we will be forced to sell. Since this is a non-homestead property there is no telling what the tax will be in 5 years when we plan on moving into this house. As a retiree I might be paying $ 7000 ($580/month) a year just for property tax. This, of course would be prohibitive.

Dear Governor Bush!

HELP!!! We have a major CRISIS! We need immediate relief from our  
property tax bills!! It is not right to have people take 2nd  
mortgages on their properties to pay a years worth of property tax.  
Last year's situation was unbearable. This year the situation has  
become impossible! Our commercial properties( which we have owned for  
10-20 years) contain about 40 small businesses. We have never planned  
on selling them, only have made a positive difference in our  
community. Not only is business off 50% this year, but our CAM has  
gone from $3/ft three years ago to $10/ft!!! $5-$6/ft is for property  
taxes alone!!!  $3 are for insurance! We haven't raised our rents in  
20 years!! It is a sin quite frankly to pay 40 % of your gross  
revenues in property taxes alone. Maybe I can put in another way.  
People are working 4-5 months out of the 12 to pay only their  
property taxes, 3 months for their insurance and having to borrow to  
pay their employees. Forget all the other variables in running a  
business such as mortgages, inventory, and other loans. Frankly, they  
are out by next year!! The increases in budgets and inequities in  
payments of property taxes need IMMEDIATE attention!!! Last year  
people were "shocked and awed" and felt helpless. We assumed there  
would be immediate corrections. This year, we are desperate!! Our  
property taxes went from $240,000 to over $800,000 in 2 year alone!!!! 
1/3 of my tenants have expressed that they will leave this year. We  
need to change laws to fix this problem immediately, before we have a  
bigger crisis on our hands. I am sure you are aware of the change in  
our real estate market. We wouldn't even be able to sale our  
properties, if we wanted right now. NO ONE IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.  
Our local boards are telling us that the problem is with the state.  
Someone needs to connect with its citizens and take RESPONSIBILITY.  
Leave a lasting impact to your legacy, please give us immediate  
relief! THIS HAS IMPACTED A MAJORITY OF OUR CITIZENS!

Governor Bush,

Palm Beach County, Florida residents are tired of the excuses about the 
out of control real estate taxes. They need to be reduced now! Every 
commissioner that spews an excuse instead of a solution is most 
assuredly going to be VOTED OUT. There are ways to cut the budget. Just 
_watch _any county worker for one day to see if a raise is in order.

You need to be involved in _cutting_, not approving pet projects and 
right now. You need to be involved in a think tank in order to REDUCE 
expenditures! Right NOW! Example: Install computer air conditioners 
set-back timers in the schools and public buildings to set temperatures 
higher in the evenings and return to normal temperatures early morning 
and much more!

Residents are fed up with the mill rate and THE WAY THE TAXES ARE 
FIGURES. They are too high and they need to be reduced right now! Every 
elected official in office can take action....RIGHT NOW!!!

/Homeowners are struggling with high real estate taxes, double-digit 
electricity bills, excessively high property insurance, maintenance-fee 
gouging emanating from brain-dead condo boards, more hurricane 
assessments from the past and we have a group of local commissioners 
making excuses for the excessive real estate taxes instead of taking 
action!!!!!!!

/What if you only devoted one hour per day in finding way to reduce real 
estate taxes? It sure would be a feather in your hat for re-election, 
_but leave politics out_....explore real reductions!!!!!

I have called assessors offices from Palm Beach County to St. Lucie to 
Ft. Pierce in the last week and _even the the county and city employees 
agree with me._ Even those who have worked for the county and city _for 
many years!!!_

What's is really ridiculous is when I was told that the home 
appreciation this year is 28.6% in Palm Beach County. Let's use common 
sense instead of bogus numbers! Talk to Realtors about this number!!!

There are eight condos in our complex that have /not/ sold in close to a 
year. Most have not had one showing!!! No sales. 28.6% increase? Give me 
a break! We have to get real. Homeowners are paying taxes on an inflated 
mill rate and the homes are not appreciating!!!

/Governor Bush, we need an elected tax commissioner. Only this official 
can set the mill rate and the way the taxes are figured to protect the 
public from his ever happening again ....and more even more brain 
storming to protect the public!
/
Many hundreds of thousands are so shell shocked from the Palm Beach 
County tax bill, they can't even call.  I am going to continue to be a 
voice of the opinion of those in a catatonic state, trying to find a way 
to reduce out-of-control real estate taxes while fat cats rally the 
troops to pay for pet projects!!!!!!!!!

Dear Mr. Bush:

 

My family and I finally had enough money to build a new house last year.  It was completed in August, 2006.  We has lived in our previous house for 18 years and we were so elated to be able to afford a new house with four bedrooms.  We budgeted ourselves and we said that for a few years, we will not be able to take any major vacations but we would be able to go to the beach or camping here in Florida.  Well we did not do a very good job on our budget.  We did not account for fuel prices going up over 30% or utilities going up over 50%. We just received the property tax proposal and the new market value of our house for 2006/2007.  I started to cry because I realized that our family would not be able to stay in our beautiful house.  My husband and I received a 3% and 2% raise respectfully last year and am not sure if we will be getting one this year.  I am going to night school so maybe I can get a better paying job but if the proposed property tax goes in affect, I will have to quit and find a second job.  We purchased our house for $ 283,000.00 and it had a market value on the tax proposal of $ 487,000.00.  Our homestead exemption is only $ 25,000.00.  Why is our family being penalized for finally getting the American dream?  Why is our taxes based on market value?  Why is homestead just $ 25,000.00? I went to the commissioner meeting last night, and it was a travesty. This is such a serious matter and they were making jokes.  My family and I think you have done a wonderful job for Florida and would like to see Florida prosper and grow but it does not look good for the State.

Subject:	Please check into these issues

Since I originally sent this under my casual e-mail address by mistake, I wanted to send it under my name one in case it did not get through under the other one.

I appreciate the job you have done while in office, especially when it comes to your responsibility in handling "State of Emergency" situations.  It is a shame that voters do not have the right to extend a term by majority vote if an official is doing a good (very good) job for the voters.
 
There are three related areas (issues) that I wish you could do something about before your term ends.  The first concerns the increase in personal spending allowed residents in skilled nursing facilities.  I know I have written to you previously on this matter, and I understand that Florida is more compationate than other states already in this area; however, it had appeared this amount was going to be raised, but no official confirmation has ever come out to that effect.  
 
Second, since the privatization of Children and Families the approval process for institutional Medicaid, especially, has taken a severe "nose dive".  There are some even in the Tallahassee offices that say by voting for you we asked for what we have gotten in the way of service.  I do not agree with that statement.  I believe it is because you do not know what has occurred by the private sector trying to make a "buck" by destroying the process.  The process was never a fast one; however, it has now become a confusing, tedious, disorganized and unfriendly process.  The individual or family member (usually family member) must send the application through the mail or apply on the internet, but still send the back-up through the mail.  This would not be a problem if the person did not have questions and concerns, and if they could have confirmation that the information was received, and the confirmation not be disputed.  The workers that remain are covering an outrageous number of counties and doing the best they can; however, they can no longer provide the guidance that is needed, nor acknowledge that information has been received.  There have been several cases where we know that information has been supplied, because we sent another copy for the person, and they have come from out of state to provide the information again, because they were told that even though they sent it certified, that the person who picked up the mail was not a worker.  We have also been informed that mail fell out on the sidewalk in front of the building.  There was two recent cases where the family wanted to hear from Children and Families what the responsibility was, so they did not pay the facility awaiting the information, and then they were denied because that made them exceed the asset limit, since the funds were still in the bank.  They were told if they would have "spent down the money" they would have qualified.  One person was able to hire an attorney, but another was not.  Although, the Omsbudsman is getting a "work out".
 
It has been mentioned that individuals have the right to appeal if they follow the correct procedures and contact the appropriate office.  It has also been mentioned that they can request a worker be assigned so that they can talk and communicate through one individual, but then it has also been mentioned that this is not the case.  No matter the truth of any of this....it must be understood that even those working for Medicaid and Medicare can have trouble keeping up with all of the rules and regulations, as well as general information....let alone anyone else.  It is especially hard on anyone in the "Baby Boomer" age group or older who has been used to talking to an individual and speaking face to face.  Plus, think about the telephone game and other games where you cannot have true communication....it is easy to get a wrong impression or misinterpretation.  If you can actually discuss the issues, you can more readily find out where you might be at cross purposes.
 
Thirdly, the funding for the skilled nursing facilities is necessary.  There are so many more requirements due to staffing, HIPAA, legal issues, eligibility, security, safety, etc, that the funding is needed to not only meet the bare costs of these areas, but also to be able to continue to meet the  "Quality of Life" requirements and necessities.  
 
Please do all you can in the above areas.

 I received this from the speaker of the house
 
Dear Mr. Speaker,
 
Thank for your response. I need to tell you that this bill is putting a hole lot of people in harms way. This was seen with the last storm that came into Florida, boaters were told by marinas that they must leave. As you know our marinas/boat yards are being sold off and turned into condo's with dockage.  I am the founder of a group called Boaters for Waterway Rights and I received a number of calls from boat owner who had no place to go. This bill is only good for marinas! Let me tell you that more home owner docks will be damaged on a larger scale, as people are forced out of a safe dockage or moorings. For most people there in no place to go other then anchoring on our waterways. This will cause some to stay with their vessel and life's are going to be lost. Sir I am keeping this letter that you sent me along with my letter to you so that I can pass it on to the next of kin of the boaters that loose their life's. Sir, for the most part this bill is a good bill. However, in this bill a marina can make you leave if he puts it in a contract form. This need to be changes. 
 
Sorry about maybe coming off a little strong but I hear the cry's of the people who feel lost.
 
Thank for your time

Captain Gill,
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding House Bill 7175 pertaining to vessel relocation during hurricanes.  I appreciate your thoughts on this issue.
 
As you know, hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage to marinas and vessels. During a storm event, changes in wind direction and fluctuations in wind intensity, excessive rain and storm surge cause moored vessels to repeatedly collide with stationary docks, and often culminate in extensive damage assessments which may evolve into a dispute between the vessel owner and the marina owner. The dispute often hinges on whether the vessel caused damage to the dock, or whether the dock caused damage to the vessel during the storm.

 

This is great

 

Florida law emphasizes the protection of life over property by prohibiting marinas from requiring vessel owners to remove their vessels from a marina once a hurricane watch or warning has been issued.

 

The bill authorizes marina personnel to take reasonable actions to further secure any vessel within the marina to minimize damage to the vessel, the marina property, private property and the environment, if the vessel is not removed once a tropical storm or hurricane watch has been issued. The marinas may charge reasonable fees for securing the vessel and held harmless for any damage that occurs as a result of securing the vessel or from any damage incurred to a vessel from such storms or hurricanes. The bill provides that no immunity is granted to the marina for any intentional acts or negligence that causes damage to the vessel during the removal or storage under this act. 

 

This will end up with vessels being made to leave every marina. If every marina is allowed to make boat owners sign a contract or notice that they must leave where do all the vessels go? It is foolish for a marina not to add this to their contract, from an insurance standpoint.

But it give the marina a reason to put vessels out in harms way. 

 

The bill provides noticing criteria in the contractual agreement which may be utilized by the marina and the vessel owner relating to the removal of the vessel once a tropical storm or hurricane watch has been issued and provides that a time frame be established for such vessel removal.

 

Again, thank you for contacting me on this issue.  If I may assist you in any matter, please contact me.

Dear Governor Bush,
  My problem is with the real estate tax for residents of FL. who also own cabanas within their condo building.  I am one such owner and am not happy to report that I cannot get my cabana to fall under the Save Our Homes amendment so the real estate tax just keep going up depending on the market value of our cabanas.  The cabana is a 10' by 20' room and the real estate tax this year went up to approximately $2,600.00.  I spoke to the county assessors office and was told if I didn't like it, I should sell my cabana.  
    I don't believe that a real estate tax should be a reason for a person to have to sell their property.  Hopefully your tax reform committee will come up with a solution to this problem.

She is paying about $1,000.00 and I am paying over $4,000.00. Her tax proposal went down!!  I understand, but do not agreee with, the homestead laws if they are this abusive to part time residents.

My husband and I own a small one bedroom condo in Cape Canaveral for the past 1 1/2 years.  During that time we have rented it to a women who is in her 80's.  We accepted rent of $500/monthly - the same she was paying in the apartment she had to vacate.  This rent is approximately $250 less then other apartments in the same complex.  We kept it affordable for her.  We recently received our tax bill from Brevard County and have been notified that the proposed budget will raise the taxes on that unit from $985.07 to $1850.43.  That is almost a 100% increase.  On the renewal of her lease, we will need to raise her rent by $72.00 a month.  We have tried to keep this rent affordable for her but the state and local authorities find nothing wrong with raising the taxes on a property by unbelievable amounts. The state and local governments must bear a great deal of responsibility for the lack of affordable housing.

I have just received my proposed property taxes on some unimproved property in Polk County Florida (Winter Haven City) the taxes have risen over 300%! Yes 300%.
 
What I see as is I, like so many others can no long do what our parents did at out age and that's "Develop" a piece of commercial property for income revenue. The land taxes I have to pay are over $1,000.00 per month when it should not be even half that amount!
 
Second, the cost of building impact fees are beyond crazy! These impact fees have caused me to be unable to build, but at the same time has placed me in a Catch-22 situation where the taxes are a financial strain to me for this unimproved land.
 
What I had saved in money all my life and hoped for a retirement income has actually been taken away from me solely due to the above unreasonable reasonable property taxes and building impact fees.
 
Something has to give.

Subject:	[*] Re.: increased property tax

Gentlemen:
It is with sadness that I see the city fathers have lost the sight of
our beautiful Deerfield Beach.

1)  By increasing our property taxes many of the snowbirds, who now
      are carrying our tax base, will be forced to sell their properties
       at a very low price, and as a result the assessed values of
       the sold properties will decrease.  Result:  a lower tax base

2)  The permanent residents will have to re-consider selling their
       properties at a considerable lower price and move to other 
       communities, including the possibility by moving out-of-state, 
       where the taxes are lower, which will effect not only Deerfield Beach
       but the entire state.   Result:  a lower tax base

3)    And, the end result will be that all the city government empolyees,
       including the elected officials have to lower their salaries, or simply
       lose their high salaried positions.  Result:  Deerfield Beach will
       cease to exist as a vital community.

Something has to be done, and the simple answer is LOWER THE

Dear Governor Bush:

 

For a short time our disabled population had some relief with their transportation.  Broward County had allotted temporary moneys for additional transport carriers.  Apparently, they finally realized that the three carriers under contract were not adequate for the numbers they were serving.  From what I’ve been told, once the money for a temporary carrier runs out, their contract with the county is automatically cancelled.  Schott Center was assigned a transport carrier, Medex Transport Inc.  Our clients using Medex’s services had far less complaints then they did with the county’s three carriers.  The only problem was they did not transport on Sunday.  We found another temporary carrier to do that service, M & T.  Medex has told me they are on the verge of running out of money and M & T has run out of money and cannot transport our clients to church on Sunday.   The old contract runs to December 31, 2006. 

 

The three current carriers are not able to transport the numbers of disabled in Broward County.  An additional infusion of money is needed to keep the temporary carriers afloat until the new contact goes into effect.

 

Whatever you can do will be greatly appreciated.

Dear Governor Bush,

My husband and I have owned a place in Hobe Sound, FL for 17 years.  We feel this is our home.  However, we also have a primary residence in MA.  We are unable to change our residency to Fl because of our health insurance.  We feel it is very unfair to penalize us for making the Homestead Act work!!!!!  Our taxes went up 30% this year!!!!!  Now we don't know if we are going to be able to keep our home there.  It saddens us greatly!!  I know we have no clout because we are not voters, but wanted you to be aware that I think this is someday going to hurt FL!!!

Sincerely,
Jane & Larry Beane

Dear Governor Bush,
 
We are new full-time residents in Mexico Beach, FL.  We moved to Mexico Beach to fulfill our dreams because we loved the Panhandle.  Property taxes in our area have increased as much as 500% over the last two years.  If this is allowed to happen, we will be forced to relocate to another state that is more understanding to the people and their needs.  We are conservative people and we pray that you as a conservative can help relieve the liberal taxes being enforced upon us.  Please help us anyway possible so that we can enjoy the remainder of our life in Mexico Beach.

FYI. 
Florida PropertyTaxes.
 
They just keep hammering us.
 Melbourne, Florida are wanting another whopping tax increase.
The "Homesteaders" are capped at inflation or 3%. 
We now are being asked to pay an increase of between 22% and 42.5% this year. The final figure to be determined in November.
Our taxes have gone up over 100% since our 2002 tax bill.

Dear Gov. Bush and The Property Tax Reform Committee,

 

I am forwarding to you more ammunition for the meetings that are taking place on the State level in response to the Save Our Homes Exemption and the devastating effects it has had on the homeowners/taxpayers in Cape Coral and Lee County Florida.  I realize I have emailed you plenty of information already, but the consequences to our city, county and state are going to be catastrophic.  Every one I talk to is ready to give their home away and get out of Florida.  And, as a Florida resident/taxpayer/voter/realtor, I am very concerned.  I already cannot talk my husband into staying in our home even if I can help get things changed.  He will not stay in Cape Coral and he will not stay in Lee County because of the corruption and windfall they have collected from taxes such as ours.  I may be able to talk my husband into moving to Charlotte county if we can affect a positive change in the SOH tax exemption and create an equal taxation system for ALL HOMEOWNERS & TAXPAYERS IN FLORIDA.

 

Thank you for listening.

Subject: LEE COUNTY BUDGET MEETING THURSDAY
Importance: High

 

Dear Lee County Commissioners and Budget Tax Review Committee,

 

Please consider these issues while reviewing and changing the Lee County Budget in your meeting tomorrow evening.

 

You must reduce the tax burden of Lee County residents and vote to reduce the millage rate overall and by much more than what is proposed. I agree with the Clerk who said that 20% cuts would be in order recently in our News-Press paper.  You made a lot of money just on my one, single property last year alone.  Do you realize that my general revenue fund went from $395 last year to a whopping $2,307 this year?  This is just ONE property tax bill. WHERE IS THIS WINDFALL GOING?  (Please don’t tell me we need it for roads and parks….gimme pot holes any day of the week!)

 

You must also remove the Lee County All Hazards-UNINC for those of us residing in Cape Coral.  We do not live in UNINCORPORATED LEE COUNTY. 

 

You must also make the Lee County Library Fund, the Lee County Hyacinth Control and the Lee County Mosquito Control as a FLAT RATE TAX.  Why is this burden NOT SHARED EQUALLY among all taxpayers? Are you telling me that there are more mosquitoes and hyacinth in my back yard than my neighbors house two doors down with a higher assessed value and a lower tax bill because of the SOH exemption ($3,700 vs. $12,000)?!?!?! NOT! Also, I do not have any children or adults utilizing the “Library Fund.”  This is ridiculous.

 

In fact, almost every line item in the Lee County Taxing Authority on my TRIM notice can be argued for taxation EQUALLY AMONG TAXPAYERS except for Schools of course.  Those of us that do not have children and will not have children in the school systems of Lee County should not be paying for it at all!

 

The West Coast Inland Waterway, SFL Water MGMT- Everglade Const & SFL Water MGMT-District/Okeechobee Levy should be shared EQUALLY AMONG LEE COUNTY TAXPAYERS.  Why is this based on the Assessed Value of the home and why is this burden NOT SHARED EQUALLY among all taxpayers? Are you telling me that I need these services more than my (homesteaded 10 years ago) neighbor?   These revenues increased on my TRIM notice 6.5 TIMES last year’s tax bill.  This is absolutely insane.

 

Our Lee county reserve fund is bursting at the seams in the 2005/2006 budget.  On page 34:  

http://www.lee-county.com/BudgetOperations/2005_2006/FY05_06BudgetBookBOOK.pdf

the amount for Lee County Reserves was a 21% increase to $581,403,554 for 2005-2006. This is bordering criminal.

 

Why don’t you give it back to those who have paid dearly over the past several years? You continue to take from the tax payers who are footing the bill--for what?  You will not need additional sheriff’s deputies because there won’t be anyone here to police.  You won’t need additional firemen and fire houses.  You won’t need to repave roads and you won’t need additional county workers to sit at their desks with nothing to do. All the snowbirds that aren’t homesteaded will sell their property and fly away and all the recently slammed homesteaders won’t stay.  

 

I will quote from an article in our local The News-Press recently about the taxes affecting growth. 

Patricia Cogswell of Cape Coral who is a 20 year veteran of real estate appraisals worries with the falling real estate market, she says “a significantly higher tax bill may be the final straw that makes more homeowners move away and builders back out on developments.”  “Unless we curb spending and reduce taxes, people will be leaving Lee County by the busload,” Cogswell said.  “If we reduce taxes during this market period slump, we will recover more quickly.  If we don’t, Lee County may never recover.  We will have truly killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.”

 

Kudos to Ms. Cogswell for speaking the truth.  

 

We will look forward to the Lee County Commissioners righting these wrongs for the taxpayer/homeowner by changing their budget this year.  Thank you.

 

Sincerely,

P.S.  You needn’t send me responses effectuating the disastrous SOH exemption and how it is the Constitution; we’re (voters/taxpayers/recently homesteaders/snowbirds) are attacking that on all fronts as well and have already contacted the Governor’s office and the Property Tax Reform Committee.  Maybe you should as well:  www.propertytaxreform.state.fl.us and maybe your voters will recognize your compassion for those who are no longer the minority (non-homesteaded & recently homesteaded at high taxes) and are overcoming the old majority (homesteaded taxpayers at low taxes).

Subject:	Assisted Living Facilities in the FLorida Keys

Dear Governer Bush,
 
Fountains of Living, Inc. is a non-profit 501c3 organization that was established for the care and protection of the elderly and disable. We established our first 6-bed Assisted Living Facility, "Lillie's House" in 2004.  I would like to request that you please direct the Florida Medicaid Office to submit an application on behalf of the State of Florida, for the HHS funding opportunity entitled "Money Follows The Person Rebalancing Demonstration."
I would like to be able to apply for some funding since ours is down due to the many disasters in the State. 
Also I would like to speak to the appropriate person who could guide and direct me as to how I can get some assistance for establishing Assisted Living Facilities for Monroe County.  The County gives us only $5,000.00 a year from their budget that they receive for distribution throughout the County. There is a  desperate need for this kind of service for the elderly in the Florida Keys. The county allocates hundreds of thousands to other non-profit organizations.  The County has one sixteen bed facility which is located near Key West over 90 miles south of our facility in the Upper Keys.  Our facility is a six-bed and we have had as many as 21 persons on our waiting list at one time.  We would like to continue to operate and establish more facilities especially for those individuals who cannot pay the full fee for service.  We established ourselves in 1999 as a non-profit organization expecting to get some assistance from the County and State.  
 We had previously applied for a Federal Grant for a wheelchair van and were very close to getting approved, however the County would not sign an agreement with us as they said they did not want too many vans since it cuts into their budget. They said we were a duplication of services.
Our service was not duplicating theirs as our would have operated on weekends and evenings as well as weekdays. I believe they are using this same reasoning as an excuse to justify their not giving us the support we need.  
This year the County is actually approving a ruling on their non-profit giving to include a clause that would disallow funding to organizations with duplicate services. Since they fund their own 16-bed facility this would exclude us from even applying. 
I have spoken personally to many of the Commissioners and to the office of the State Representative to no avail.  The County is talking about establishing a 50-bed facility in Key West (again over 90 miles south of us.) And I know this will take years to develop, meanwhile the elderly and disabled continue to be oppressed .    
I do not feel that this is fair and I would like to know who I can talk to about this. According to the 2000 census there were over 39% elderly and/or disabled in the Keys.  This number is growing steadily.  I know this because I am registered nurse who has been involved in this type of care in the Florida Keys since 1994.  
Please won't you direct me to someone who cares about this population and someone who can help us continue this ever-important work.
Thank you for time and consideration .. I will look forward to your response.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Please support making Save Our Homes portable so that we are not
trapped in our current home.  

I have listed below our taxes on a small lot that we purchased.  We
had planned to build our dream home on this lot upon retirement and
spend the rest of our lives in this community.  We keep thinking that
if we work one more year and save everything we can, we can exercise
our plans, but then we find out that the taxes have jumped once again.
The escalating taxes have just about destroyed our dreams.  Building
our dream home on our lot without this Save Our Homes portability,
will amount to an unmanageable tax bill.

2005          $5803.61
2004          $4293.02
2003          $3403.81
2002          $2013.27
2001          $1821.45
2000          $1619.01

I hope that you will support making Save Our Homes portable so that
hard working people like us who plan and save are not trapped in our
current homes.

Governor Bush,
 
Please see the attached email from our property appraisers office. We were forced to move out of our home the day Hurricane Charley hit and now we lost our (Save our Homes) exemption since it is not portable.  After several months of "back and forth" with our insurance company and finding it difficult to get any work done we purchased a new home. Can anything be done at the state level to make the save our homes transferable to another home if a family is forced to move because their home is uninhabitable after a disaster?

Dear Mr. Bush

   I am Emma Kell from FLVS, biology class, studying conservation, and I 
would like to bring an important issue to your attention. Everyday, many 
species become extinct. But because of a program, The Endangered Species 
Act, and its thousands of members who took the time and dedication to bring 
this to others' attention, 99% of the species on the endangered list have 
been preserved and are even proliferating.
   The project is a simple one. It takes on a worthy cause and brings it to 
officials' attentions by forming a petition, and showing them how many 
people actually do care what's happening to their, and others', environment.
Nature is a delicate balance, force one species out before their time and it 
will affect many more, including humans, than one would imagine. It is in 
nature's cycle to exterminate spcies, but man has taken it much further. We 
are destroying lands and forests that are homes and only living places of 
animals of every kind. Pollution is another big problem. It toxifies the 
environment and kills animals all the time. Cleaner alternatives are out 
there, all that remains is for them to be found. If you could just take a 
little time and funding to set aside some land for these wonderful 
creatures, it would mean life for many threatened and endangered species.
   Thank you for taking the time to appreciate this delicate issue. I really 
appreciate it.

Dear Jeb, 
I know you have heard so much feedback on the high Florida property taxes.  Many starters are not moving up to larger homes and making room for new starters because of the rising costs of property taxes and insurance.

My husband and I after fourteen years are still in our starter home which we purchased before our children were born.  We now share our two bedroom home with our two boys ages eleven & three.  We need more room and my eleven year old needs his own bedroom but we can not afford to move. I don't understand, it use to be the cost of homes held us back now it's the cost of taxes and insurance. We just can't seem to move forward.

We want to move to a larger home in the same Seminole (Pinellas) area but we can not afford the higher property taxes.

You have been promising Tax Cuts for Floridian's for the past year and we have seen nothing but increases.
We just received our Seminole County Property Tax bill and it is going up again, but how can this be with thousands of new homes and all the inflated sales prices ???
All The County's in Florida need the mill-ages lowered by a State Mandate.
Seminole County Sales Tax is still 7% instead of 6% like most of Florida ???
Utilities - FPL, Water, Home and Cell phones Taxes are the highest in the Country along with New York and California....
License Plates Renewals and other county taxes continue to go up every year also.
 
So please if you are going to make promises about tax cuts let us know where they are while Seminole, Orange and Volusia Counties Governments are truly stealing Millions from us every year in Property and Sales Taxes.

Subject:	Outrageous Taxes in Florida

Dear Governor Bush and the Florida Property Tax Reform Committee,

 

I am writing to you with great disappointment and frustration as the future of my retirement property investment is at risk.  I don’t know how the government can expect anyone to keep up with this pace.  You already have a sliding market due to the hurricanes and now the assessed values have sky rocketed in an effort to create more tax revenues.  Is any one paying attention and being held accountable?  The recent hurricanes have already increased the insurance rates by 60 – 80%.  People are loosing their homes and their retirement investments. 

 

I’m talking about the average person here and there are plenty of them in Florida.  Just because a person has invested in Florida property for future retirement doesn’t necessarily mean they have deep pockets and should be carrying the weight of the state.  Nor should anyone who has moved from one home to another be penalized by the confusing homestead exemption laws in your state.

 

I have been reading many articles about the people who are homesteaded and are paying a fortune to help out those who were fortunate enough to have homesteaded years ago.  I understand the concept of the SOH program but there seems to something wrong with this program if it is severely penalizing innocent tax payers just because they have chosen to relocate. 

 

My husband and I were sick to our stomachs when we opened our tax assessment.  Our assessed value went up $230,000 in one year and we have not made any improvements.   This would not be a problem if we could sell our home for this assessed value but we know that is unrealistic especially now that a new buyer would be looking at paying in excess of $13,000 in taxes a year!  

 

We do not qualify for homestead but my new understanding is that the homestead tax exemption is a damn joke anyway.   My next door neighbors are paying only$1,000 less then we are and they are homesteaded as of last year.  

 

Aaaahhhh, the American dream has now become the American nightmare in your sunshine state.

 

I am terribly saddened with this situation as will be forced to sell what we had planned to retire in.  We work very hard for our money Mr. Bush and we have never asked for a hand out in any way.  We pay dearly each year at tax time, we do not cheat but I have to tell you I feel as if I am being cheated by the government.  You have had your hand out far too often and every time to average citizen can get one hand up here you come and push them back under again.  

 

You watch the snow birds as they fly elsewhere for their winters and see what becomes of your state.  

 

If the unequal tax burden is not resolved in Florida, new Florida home owners will simply find a new home state where home owners/voters are taxed equally and not discriminated against based on how long they have lived there or if they are homesteaded or not.

Importance:	High

Dear Jeb,
I hate to see your term coming to an end. You have been great!
 
I need some direction. We live in Clearwater and the assessed values
over the past 3 years or so have gone up 85%. Our Mayor and Council
spend and increase taxes every year to the point that fixed income people
cannot have life's essentials as the taxes keep going higher and higher
even though no improvements have been done. It the property is homesteaded
there is relief. Income properties are being forced to raise rents and they
still continue to spend ... spend ..spend. They dropped the millage like .003 percent
instead of 10 percent. Middle income people cannot afford it with the insurance and
a crazy council that just approved the budget even though the town is furious!!!  
 
Can Tallahassee help control these folks? Can we have a Prop 13?
Is this a problem all over Florida or other towns have  responsible Mayors and Councils.
 
Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. We are all ready to start petitions etc.
We just need help determining what we need to do.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
My husband and I are owners of  a condominium in Hallandale Beach, Florida ( BROWARD COUNTY ).  We have been spending our winters in your beautiful state for the last 4 years and all of our vacations previous to that for 9 years.  We have paid our property taxes on time every year with no real complaint.  This year, however, we are very shocked at the unreasonable increase in property taxes.  From $2200.00 to $4200.00 approx.  How is this possible ? We live in Canada and this makes it very difficult to attend any public hearings on the matter as is the petition process which requests comparative sale studies etc. and a personal visit to the office before making a petition.
 
We realize that this issue may not be at the top of your list, but you must know that tourism is huge in Florida and a very large Canadian contingent makes its way to Florida every single year.  They also spend millions of dollars in your state.  We are an important factor in the overall economy. In our time in Florida we spend between $15,000 and $20,000.00 on food and entertainment as well as any trades we may require while we are there.
 
When we wre not there we do not use water, electricity or any other valuable commodities, yet we must pay big time to own property in Florida.
 
You area busy man but we would like to hear your feelings on this issue.

Subject:	Escambia county Taxes

Dear Governor Bush,

I am a past resident of Pensacola, Florida who now finds herself living in Alabama with the hopes of moving back to Pensacola within the next 3 years. I am very blest that I own a condo on Perdido Key Beach and therefore I am a tax paying citizen of Escambia county. Since many of the owners are non-residents of Florida we feel that we have taxation without representation. For years Perdido Key has been a ready cash source for Escambia County and the elected officials have neglected the Perdido Key infrastructure with a fair share of the cash from Perdido Key Taxes. I have been told that since I cannot vote in Florida, there is not anything I can do about the tax increases.

The future outlook for Condominium owners planning to retire on Perdido Key is rather grim, when you consider the aspect of high taxes, astronomical insurance cost, low rentals,  non-existent buyers, no infrastructure enhancement for the foreseeable future, and the ever existing threat of Hurricanes. Added to all this is the almost double increase in property taxes in Escambia county.  

Many states have laws requiring a reduction in mill rates when assessments reach a certain level. Is there a way to slow down this outrageous tax situation? 

It is becoming to expensive for many to retire or vacation on Perdido Key. 

I am sure you have more serious and pressing matters to attend. But if you could take a moment and have someone check into the property tax situation in Escambia county, there are a lot of who would be so grateful. I would like to keep my condo if at all possible. Right now it does not look good. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Dear Govenor Bush,

I am writing you to encourage Florida Medicaid to take advantage of the HHS Funding opportunity, which would expand housing for the elderly and disabled.  This funding would provide the elderly and the disabled within the State of Florida the opportunity to live in the community, instead of an institution, which parallels the mission and scope of our great state.  As you are aware, the deadline for this funding source is November 1st, so  Florida Medicaid is running out of time.  Once again, I would appreciate if you could persuade the State to apply for this much needed funding.

Subject:	[*] Perdido Key Tax Increases

Dear Governor Bush:
 
It is with profound disappointment we learned of Escambia County’s efforts to significantly raise the property taxes on our Perdido Key condominium at Palacio (Unit # 1003).
 
What we find to be specifically objectionable is the targeting of condominiums for property tax escalation. As you are well aware, many of these units are owned by individuals such as us who reside outside of Florida area. As you are also aware, increasing the property values of this group casts the appearance of taxing out-of-state residents to avoid political repercussions that would surely result from similar taxing circumstances at the local level.
 
Our purchase of this condominium was intended as a retirement destination, a time that will come within the next several years. However, the proposed property tax increases would mean that we would have to place our unit up for sale – a common result of such tax imprudence. 
 
Consequently, how many others will do the same thing? What will then happen to Escambia’s tax base? As property values decrease (and they will) as a result of high taxes, who will then rescue the county when the proverbial Golden Goose has been sacrificed in the name of fiscal assertiveness? Who will become Palacio’s new tenants? Who will become the new taxpayers? 
 
Consider, if you will, the effect of such a scenario on local commerce. At present, every person vacationing in Perdido Key contributes between $750 to $1,000 to the local economy. With a lack of hotels in this area, those who occupy our units are there because of our units. 
 
It is important to also note that abrupt tax escalation never benefits a community. Such action only results in negative economic and social impact. In Perdido Key, and subsequently in Escambia County, that impact will assume the form of job losses and income taxes – particularly within the construction industry.
 
At a time when Escambia County should be helping to restore beachfront property, it has instead elected to financially burden the very people who are the foundation of its resort community. Given what we all went through following Ivan (including nonresidents), the effort to significantly raise Palacio taxes represents an insensitive gesture of remarkable proportion. 
 
Since purchase of our unit two years ago, we have seen its value decrease by nearly $150,000. Additionally, because we are renting our unit until retirement, we must subsidize the mortgage payment by almost $1,500 per month. And that does not take into account a hefty increase in recent insurance costs.
 
While we may not be registered voters in Escambia at present, we both vote. And when we do retire, we will be obviously looking to elect those individuals with the common sense to put the best interests of Escambia at the forefront of their respective agendas.
 
From what I understand, you are such an individual. 
 
We are certain you fully understand the grave situation that will result from any form of a tax grab. It is for this reason we ask your support in seeking tax reductions that will accelerate – rather than negate – economic momentum to achieve a viable, fiscally sound Perdido Key resort.
 
Your consideration is greatly appreciated. 
 
Sincerely,

Honorable Governor Bush,

 

We know how deeply you care for the well being of our Floridians.

We believe you truly understand how widely the gap continues to expand between our citizen income and costs of living here.

I hope you have considered that, regardless of storm impacted areas, the cost for housing is beyond the average affordable rate 

for a typical family with two incomes.

As rents increase, your fixed income families such as the elderly or disabled also loose ground.

This is not about buying a home. That American Dream is no longer applicable to most Florida Blue Collar families.

The Florida Dream has simply been reduced to paying the rent, keeping food on the table and the lights on.

As I’m certain you have never had the misfortune to live one missed check away from loosing a roof over your families head,

I still believe you have a great compassion for Florida’s families that do live “hand to mouth”.  

Please don’t leave your impoverished elderly and disabled behind!  Our Florida doesn’t want to see them living under a bridge

or in the Nursing home or Institutional facility when they are able to look after their own issues of daily living. 

I ask that you direct the Florida Medicaid Office to submit an application on behalf of the State of Florida, for the HHS Funding
Opportunity entitled “Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration.

This small measure could lighten the burden on State dollars encumbered to pay for a Medicaid/Medicare bed in an institution. 

An Institution should be a place for Learning, not a place for living. 

We’re counting on you Boss!

 

Respectfully & Sincerely,

Your ineloquent resident,

Subject:    Property assessments and taxes

 

 

 

For some years now, as a result of Florida State legislation, owners of “seasonal” property in Florida have been unjustly treated in the area of property taxation.  Where “Homesteaders” have seen their taxes increase by a maximum of 3%, many of us “Snowbirds” have been subjected to significant double-digit increases.

 

We do not question the fact that costs for providing emergency

and other services to the community have risen, as have our personal budgets. However, no one can convince me that the services provided by Broward County and Deerfield Beach have increased in cost by anywhere near the proposed tax increases, as outlined in the recent preliminary tax bill we received from Ms Parrish. 

 

In addition, we “seasonal” property owners who, on average, utilize the services four - five months a year, disproportionately subsidize the year-round residents who utilize these services on a 12-month basis. 

 

We find this situation outrageous and intolerable! 

 

Anything more that single-digit increases in the current economic picture can only give rise to forced sales, decreased values and a drop in Snowbird migration.

 

If your jurisdictions and the State of Florida do not want to scare away investors and tourists who come and spend millions of dollars in your economy, you must ensure that the proposed tax increases are withdrawn.




 

 

 

 

We appreciate that public hearings on the proposed budget will be

held. But those of us who are paying the most will have the least opportunity to attend and speak our minds.  Does it make sense for us to fly to Florida to appear at the hearings?  Certainly not!!  Our costs for such a trip would far outweigh any potential gain. 

 

 

We call you on you and your elected commissioners at the local, county

and state levels to have the interests of ALL residents, full-time or

seasonal, at heart.  

 

Thank you and I would appreciate hearing your positions on this matter at your earliest convenience.

 

Yours truly,

Subject:	Objection to tax increase

The undersigned are all winter residents, otherwise known as "Snowbirds," living in Century Village, Deerfield Beach, Florida, and we believe as temporary residents, we are being discriminated against.
 
Who are we?  We are a group of senior retirees who have worked hard all our lives, and now, when we thought we found a place we could live quietly and relatively inexpensively for a few winter months each year, it has become evident that this is not to be.  More and more of us will be selling our modest condos because we just cannot afford the increased taxes and insurance premiums. 
 
Yes, we are just average Canadians.  We are the Canadians who paid for our condos in U.S. dollars when the Canadian dollar was half or three-quarters of the U.S. dollar.  We made many sacrifices, but now even that is not enough.
 
Does it make sense to you that the relative few who live in Florida less than half a year should be responsible for the bulk of the expenses of all home owners in the State of Florida?  Does it make sense to you that those who live in Florida all year round, or for tax purposes say they do, should be exempted from carrying their fair share of expenses?  We don't use your schools, we don't wear out your roads, we don't use up your electricity or water.  We do, however, carry our full share of condo fees and insurance even though we only live in our condos a few months a year.  We do make it possible for all the "Homesteaders" to live at a fraction of the cost.  We do spend money in your shops and restaurants and help to keep your economy rolling by keeping people employed.  We do believe that it is time for the governing bodies to respect and acknowledge our contribution and not to make us their cash cow. 
 
Logic dictates that users should be payers.  And yet, the State of Florida continues to perpetuate this discriminatory Homesteaders taxation policy not only with unequal tax assessements, but with unreasonable and untenable tax rates.  We understand that as we are not permanent residents of the State of Florida we do not have the right to vote, however, because of the system that is in place, this is a blaring example of what can happen when there is taxation without representation.  
 
We are angry, disappointed, frustrated and financially strapped and we ask that you consider the following:
 
1)  CUT THE TAX RATE - there has been a 91% price hike over the past three years for the "Snowbirds."
 
2)  Understand that we just cannot afford these stiff increases and it will show clearly if and when we return to Florida, for our disposible income is severly shrinking.
 
3) Consider what your situation will be if a majority of "Snowbirds" decide to sell their properties to  only Homesteaders.  Where will you find the tax dollars that you are presently getting from us?  It is time for you to take it there now.
 
4) Consider that many may be forced to sell and either not return to the U.S. or move elsewhere to a more welcoming climate.
 
The courtesy of a response to this e-mail will be most appreciated.  I will convey your message to the others who have joined with me, gracealter@bellnet.ca

Subject:	New Construction Property Tax Discrimination

The following has also been submitted to my Senator and State Representative, as well as the Citrus Cty. Chronicle this date. I sincerely hope a  remedy is soon implemented to correct  this grave inequity. Thank you.
 
 

 

I applaud Fred Miller’s letter of 8/17 regarding the residential homestead exemption. I, too, am a retired Michigan realtor and wish to expand on this issue based on my personal experience since moving to this community last year.

 

Assessments of residential properties are performed each January. These assessments include homes sold the previous year. The new owner who purchased an existing home for $200,000 in 2004 will have a pretty good handle as to what his taxes will be, particularly if he bought during the last quarter of the year, because he will be assessed at current market value in January 2005, almost immediately following the purchase. 

 

The purchaser of new construction, however, experiences something quite different. He contracts for a $200,000 home in 2004, closes in 2005 (if he is lucky) and is assessed in January of 2006. His $200,000 purchase results in an assessment of $350,000 which is determined to be fair market value in 2006. 

 

Both sales in the above examples were $200,000. If the existing home sale had been assessed 2 years later as was the new construction they would probably both have been assessed at a fair market value of $350,000. Why is it such a tax disadvantage to purchase new construction? 

 

Property tax discrimination against buyers of new construction must be eliminated. The result of a $350,000 assessment in the example above is $5,000-$6,000 in taxes. Many  purchasers of new construction in Citrus County are seniors living on fixed incomes. Combine the taxes with our horrific utility costs and seniors will not only be selling, but permanently taking leave if they can’t take their “Save our Homes” cap with them. 

 

I challenge our politicians to bring this grave inequity to Tallahassee’s attention. There may be several effective remedies. If the purchase price on the closing document is not acceptable to assess, then offer a reduced millage rate to new construction. I also urge you to take a good look at Mr. Miller’s solutions to homestead exemptions and to offer seniors the opportunity to take their “Save our Homes” cap with them when they move.

Subject:	Realty taxes

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am a snowbird from Canada who purchased a home in Palm Beach County last year. I am writing to express my concern regarding the "Save Our Homes" legislation. I find this law extremely unfair and short sighted. 
 
Why should I pay realty taxes three times the amount of my neighbor who lives in exactly the same home. This is contrary to one of your country's founding principles. Where I live in Canada we have a system where all real estate is valued to market value every three years and the mill rate adjusted to provide sufficient taxation to local government. The result is most homeowners pay a little more each year rather than gouging new residents. If a neighborhood has higher priced homes being built then the homeowners there pay more but poorer neighborhoods end up paying less. It is more like the income tax system where those that can pay more. Under your current system most people can't afford to move, even to a less desirable location, because their new home's realty taxes will far exceed what they are currently paying.
 
The current legislation may appear to be politically expedient but it is not. It will ultimately result in lower real estate values and slower housing sales. The population base that it is intended to protect will soon be leaving their homes as a result of aging. Their ability to sell their homes will be severely limited by exorbitant insurance costs and even more exorbitant realty taxes. Why should someone pay theses huge housing operating costs when they can simply live in a similar life style in Georgia, South Carolina, California or Arizona. 
 
Your government has to act to correct this oversight. Otherwise people will become unable to sell  their homes and the real estate market will collapse.

Subject:	PROPOSED PROPERTY TAX  INCREASES

September 3, 2006
 
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
 
I am a seasonal resident at Century Village, Deerfield Beach, Fla.
 
Upon receiving my recent tax proposal bill I find that snowbirds have been discrimanated against by the fact that the State Legislator prevents us as seasonal residents from benefiting from the homesteaders exemption.
 
I find that the tax increases each year plus the ridiculously high home insurance premiums which have tripled in my case, since last year are exhorbidently high.
 
I am retired and on a limited budget.  I enjoy spending my 4 months in Florida each winter, but with all these high costs, we snowbirds will be forced to cut our spending in Florida which will surely have an effect on your economy.
 
Presently, there are over 700 condos out of 8800 for sale in C.V.E.  This is not a good indication for your economy in the future.  No doubt there will be more.
 
I find that my taxes have risen more so in the past two years than it has in the total 11 years that I own this condo.
 
The tax hike is an unfair calculation to snowbirds.  Your hearing dates in September should be in December to reflect the arrival of snowbirds.  It is totally unjust to charge a higher tax rate to snowbirds over homesteaders.  Is there a justification for this tax calculation?  TREAT HOMESTEADERS AND SNOWBIRDS EQUALLY!  Or perhaps, homesteaders should have a higher tax assesment since they use the services 12 months a year.  We snowbirds should get a tax break since we only use your system during the winter months.
 
PLEASE CUT THE TAX RATE, as we cannot afford the stiff increases which in turn will force us to spend less as our disposable incomes are shrinking.  This may result in many more condo sales to homesteaders which will reflect a lesser tax income to the state.
 
I hope you will consider my appeal to help the snowbirds.  I would appreciate receiving a reply shortly.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Brenda Pedvis

i'd like to hear what Mr. Bush has to say about  "save our homes"  killing the non-resident and  dramatically reducing the very essential Florida tourist housing. Florida will die without the tourist sales tax revenue.  With a waterfront condo paying $4000 under save our homes and $15000,  for a non permanent resident  who rents, is catastrophic,   As the non-resident bails out of the rental pool and either takes homestead themselves or sells to someone who will.  This is a huge problem facing florida with 17% increases in taxes on part year residents this year and 22% last year.  If you don't think it's a problem,  ask any realtor what's happening in the rental condo market or ask the appraisers about the increase in  fraud by non-residents who rent themselves without a mgmt company and still claim the "save our homes".  We honest part time owners are picking up all the tab for increases in county government, schools,  hospitals, fire, and police.  john skalet

I know that the Florida property tax structure is and has been a mess especially for non-residents but we have owned property in Mexico Beach since 1983 and I would have never thought that we could lose the property through taxation but I can believe it now.  I know you have set up a committee to try to resolve some of these problems but we need relief now.  Please see the below e-mails which partially explain our situation.
 
Can you give us any help immediately?  We will return to the Tax Appraisers office at 8:00 AM Tuesday morning to try and get the 30% off the land values that a lot of Mexico Beach people have been able to get without any trouble.  We don't understand why we are being discriminated against.
 
We can't vote for you but we bring many tax dollars to the state of Florida.
 
Please help!!!
 
Please see the e-mails below between Don Langston and myself regarding the Bay County/City of Mexico Beach Tax inequality that is going on.  Is there any way that we might get some news coverage to help with non-residents being discriminated against?  We will be attending the tax meeting on September 6 at 6:00 PM at the Mexico Beach Civic Center, 105 N. 31ST Street to see if there is anything that will be done about this tax situation.
 
Since these e-mails, the Belchers were informed by their neighbor, who was still in the Appraisers Office when we left without the 30% decrease,  that he, his son, and other neighbors were able to obtain the 30% tax relief reduction on their land.  How can this be happening?  Why is everyone not being treated equally.  The only fair way for this to have been done was to give everyone the reduction regardless of whether they called or went in to see the Tax Appraiser instead of only giving it to the ones who complained and not to some of the ones who complained.  The land values were inflated excessively and should be rolled back across the board.
 
Al Cathey, the Mayor of Mexico Beach, owns a mobile home across the street from our mobile home and he has had his land assessment on this property lowered from $159,695 to $111,786 and it is showing in the computer as such.  He owns a total of 16 separate properties in Mexico Beach and it appears that every one of these have been lowered.   One of the properties he owns at 107 30th St which is a 75X105 lot listed as a garage has a land appraised value of $78,408 but a Barbara Sennett, Rome, Georgia owns a 75X100 lot at 107 30th Street which has a land value of $482,391.  He owns a 108X158 lot at 103 30th Street with an assessed value of $170,319 and a Wilma Hollberg (Trustee) from Griffin, Georgia owns a 75X100 lot at 103 30th Street with an assessed value of $482,391.  Is this not discrimination for non-residents?
 
When we non-residents had our taxes tripled in 2005, we assumed that was going to happen sooner or later because of the inflated selling boom in Mexico Beach but we did not even begin to think that this year our assessed values would double the triple from last year and that the Mexico Beach taxes would increase 129.24%.  Why has Mexico Beach not lowered their mileage rate like some of the other areas??  With the win fall that Mexico Beach will get from this tax increase, there will be so much fraud and waste  that were will not be anyway a bookkeeper or CPA could keep up with it.
 
We have tried for years to get the city to fix a drainage problem on our lot which decreased in value years ago when the street was paved and we were left lower than the street and all the water runs off from the road and from the yard next door into our yard but the city has refused to fix it.  At one time, they promised to put in sewers but the supervisor changed and that was the end of that.  Our friends on Fortner have tried to get a street light on their block for years and the city won't put one in.  What is the City of Mexico Beach doing with all that money or is it that we are non-residents and we can't vote so therefore they don't have to do anything for us.
 
Can we please get some help from the news stations to make these problems known so that we non-residents can ban together and get some relief from this tax inequality or get a lawyer to see if we have a legal case against Bay County and Mexico Beach.
 
e-mail sent to Don Langston:
"If something can't be done about the high taxation in 2005 and 2006, many property owners who do not permanently live in Florida will be taxed out of the state.  Many of our friends from Georgia own and have owned property in the Mexico Beach Area for  years and we are all seniors and find that we will not be able to afford the property taxes unless something is done about these high appraisals.  We bring many, many dollars to Florida from the state of Georgia and believe that the state of Florida would lose tax dollars if all the out of state people who own property in Florida were unable to travel to Florida numerous times a year and stay for a good portion of the year.
 
A cap on non-homestead property until the person sells it would work. We have this in the county in which we live for homestead property. 
 
Limit a taxing authority's budget increase.  Our property taxes were tripled 2005 and then that doubled 2006.  That is excessive.
 
You would think with all the building in Bay County that instead of increasing the taxes, it would make them go down and should.  In the county in which we live, we are taxed on 40% of the Market Value which is reasonable.  That applies to resident and non-residents.
 
Where would Florida be without the tourism and outside property owners?????
 
Any tax relief for the non-residents would certainly be appreciated.

Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding property taxes in Bay County. I will be sure to pass your concerns on to the Property Tax Reform Committee. Your input, like that of many others we are hearing from, will be important in shaping the recommendations of the committee. Also, I encourage you, if you have any specific ideas for solutions to the problems you mention, to submit them to the committee via our website at www.propertytaxreform.state.fl.us. 

If you are not already aware, you should know that current Florida law offers you a couple of ways to try to reduce the tax increase you are facing.  First, if you feel your property is not properly valued, you can appeal the Property Appraiser's assessment to the appraiser himself and to the Value Adjustment Board in your county.  I strongly urge you to contact the Bay County Property Appraiser for more information on how to do that.  Second, you can attend the budget hearings at which the local governments in your area will be setting their tax rates.  Let them know of your concerns.

Again, thanks for your input.

Thanks for your quick reply.  We met with a Property Appraiser of Bay County yesterday.  The day before we had friends who met with Frank Brown and he reduced their land value by 30%.  They are much closer to the Beach and have a house versus a mobile home like we have.  Mr. Brown told them that he had been given the authority to reduce the land value of anyone who came in or called the appraiser's office by 30% which was a one time deal.  We had received a card from Mayor Al Cathey of Mexico Beach telling us to be sure and go into the appraiser's office as soon as possible to get our value reduced.  We and our friends the Belchers' went early yesterday morning and I was told by Frank Brown that he would not reduce ours any because there was a legal issue about the card that the Mayor sent out and everyone was mad about it. I told him that our friends had been able to get theirs reduced the day before and in the computer the rental property across the street from our place that is owned by the Mayor Al Cathey of Mexico Beach showed that he had his reduced by 30%.  He assured me that all those people's value would be retracted.  The Belcher's spoke with another Appraiser and was able to get theirs down some.  I requested to speak with that person and was able to get ours down $10,000 due to some error in the measurements of the lot which is very little considering that our evaluation went from $35,373 in 2004 to $102,653 in 2005 and $189,175 in 2006.  These kinds of jumps seem very excessive.
 
I think that the County should have held off  with any increase for 2006 or at least only done a small increase since it was evident that the prices of property in Mexico Beach had already started to drop.   The end of 2004 and 2005 a lot of people came in and bought property and resold it but never put any furniture into the houses because it was like a dot.com boom.  This has hurt the people of Mexico Beach especially non-residents which there are many.
 
Thank you again for your interest and we are going to try everything we can to make our voice heard."

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Will you work with the next Governor to change the Sunshine State Standards and FCAT and replace them with standards and testing that will make our children competitive nationally and globally?  
 
There is no need to reinvent the wheel in Florida.  Florida need only implement the same standards and testing used in Massachusetts or Indiana - both have been highly ranked.  
 
K-12 students in every school district in Florida should be learning the same thing at the same time as K-12 students in Massachusetts or Indiana!  Florida should not operate in a vacuum.
 
Please take a look at the standards and testing for states like Massachusetts and Indiana which were given an A by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation -  http://www.edexcellence.net/foundation/publication/publication.cfm?id=358
 
Florida's Sunshine State Standards received mostly Fs and Ds.

Subject:	Skyrocketing Property Taxes-Please Help

I am writing regarding the unacceptable situation with the property taxes in this state.  The tax system needs to be revamped as soon as possible, it should have been years ago.  There needs to be adjustments made to the homestead portion of the tax code, never did anyone who created this system figure values would soar 20, 30 even 40% a year.  People cannot afford to move, landlords have to raise rents substantially and commercial owners are trying to just tread water. Where is our representation and who is looking out for us?  We are a small landlord in Sarasota County with four rental properties and we just received our Trim notice.  The taxes are increasing between 36 to 49% on these properties this year.  There are flaws in all areas involved with these taxes.  I have spoken with everyone from the local tax office to the state tax office.  First, the problem is in the fact that the county has not kept the assessed values where they needed to be, by law.  These properties have been grossly undervalued because of the unsustainable appreciation.  What should have happened is that somewhere in this tangled maze someone should have reassessed all properties to their current values and the millage rates should have been dropped accordingly.  Instead, that was never done, which allowed the local tax office to raise the assessments by 36 to 49% and allow them to say that if the properties are at or below the values stated then there is nothing they can do.  The state says the system is working, although it's not, and somewhere out there someone was supposed to be sure that the assessed values and property values were at close to 85%, not at or under 50%.  There is a windfall of money to everyone from the local county level to the state level.  No one readjusts the millage rates to compensate for skyrocketing values.  And in the end, the tenants are hurt, who will now be faced with skyrocketing rent increases, and they are the people who can least afford it.  Not to mention the commercial owners and the people who are trapped unable to move to larger or smaller houses because of the flawed tax system. So, will someone step up and take control of the situation - it is dire - and cannot be put off any longer.  Thank you  - Lisa Smith

Subject:	Save Our Homes

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am a Florida Licensed Real Estate salesperson and Mortgage Broker. My wife and I moved to Cape Coral, Lee County, Florida 3 years ago as we were attracted to lower home prices and property taxes. In the past few years I have developed a better understanding of how “Save Our Homes” works and would like to share my thoughts with you in the hopes that they will result in improvements in the way we levy property taxes in Florida.

 


What Is "Save Our Homes"? The following is the answer as it appears on the Lee County Property Appraiser’s web site:


Save Our Homes" (SOH) spearheaded by Mr. Wilkinson, approved by Florida voters in 1992, effective January 1, 1995.  SOH places a limitation of 3% on annual assessment increases on homestead exempt property. For all property first granted homestead exemption in the prior year, that year’s assessed value will be the base value for the implementation of "Save Our Homes". Thereafter, the assessed value will not increase more than 3% or the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is less. 

 

 

Save our homes is nothing more than a subsidy program which extends an undeservedly large real estate tax exemption solely on the basis of how long the home owner has owned and lived in his/her home. The tax exemption given to one homeowner is being paid for by another homeowner. The homeowners who have purchased their homes in 1995 or earlier, get the most tax subsidy at the expense of all the other homeowners who have purchased their homes in subsequent years. The residents who pay the most real estate taxes per assessed dollar, are the most recent homebuyers.

 

In essence, the save our homes law had the effect of shifting the tax burden from one group of property owners to another. There are 4 main groups of property owners that pay the cost of those subsidies or exemptions in the form of relatively higher real estate taxes:

 

1)      New home buyers/first time home buyers

2)      Part time residents

3)      Investment/Rental property owners

4)      Commercial property owners

 

In the first group, the first time homebuyer is predominantly a young buyer that can ill afford to be subsidizing the real estate taxes of other more established homeowners just because they purchased their home earlier. In addition to not making any sense, the law seems to discriminate against the younger homebuyer.

 

In the second group, part time residents (snow birds) do not qualify for the S.O.H. exemption because they are not homesteaded and pay the highest tax, year after year, and they only occupy their home less than 6 months a year. They certainly don’t use as much of the city’s services and resources, yet they subsidize most of the full time residents.

 

In the third group, the rental property owner does not qualify for the S.O.H. tax exemption and is also paying the highest tax per assessed dollar and must pass this tax subsidy on to the tenants in the form of higher rents.

 The S.O.H subsidy program is indirectly discriminating against all renters in the State of Florida in favor of all or most resident homeowners.

 

This shift in the tax burden from one group of taxpayers to another has created significant inequities as shown in the next example. The homes chosen in the example are on the same block and have relatively close assessed values. Because the 2006 taxes have not been finalized yet, the 2005 millage rate of $20.02 per $1,000 of assessed valuation was used to calculate the ad valorem taxes using the Lee County Property appraiser’s most recent assessed values:

 

 

                                                     EXAMPLE 1

 

PROPERTY                  DATE             ASSESSED          S.O.H.             AD VALOREM


   ADRESS              PURCHASED           VALUE       EXEMPTION             TAXES_


#5318                           9/1/1995          $527,010           $378,110             $2,480.48


 

#5317                            8/27/2001            504,590              208,120                 5,434.83

 

#5229                            8/27/2003            520,660                  -0-                   10,423.61

 

 

The inequities that the Save Our Homes has created are gigantic in proportions and will only get worse in the future. The only way to fix this mess now is to eliminate the tax subsidy, which discriminates against some groups of taxpayers in favor of others for no logical reason. This law cannot and will not pass the test of time. In time, the disparity between the taxes paid by established residents with high S.O.H. exemptions and those paid by new homebuyers, will grow bigger and bigger. It will be increasingly difficult to fix the problem in the future.

 

Save our homes has created the following problems:

 

1)      Tremendous inequities in the amount of real estate taxes paid by owners of 2 identically assessed homes. In the above example, the owner who purchased the house in 2003 is paying 4 times as much as the one purchased in 1995. Both homes get the sameidentical services and have basically the same value. Save our home has created a seniority system whereby the homeowner accumulates tax exemptions the longer he/she stays in his/her home while the costs of those exemptions are being picked up by other taxpayers. That’s totally absurd. A person moving to the State of Florida today is no less of a resident or citizen of the USA than a person who came 2 years earlier. The new homebuyer is entitled to the same fair and equal treatment as his neighbor who came before him/her.

 

 

 

2)      Because the Save our Homes system shifts the tax burden from one group to another, the first time homebuyer is assuming an unfair and relatively larger share of the tax burden. It is hard to believe that we would penalize this group, who are usually the young buyers, when it is already difficult for them to purchase a home.

 

 

 

3)      Tenants are another group that are indirectly being penalized because they have to absorb, in the form of higher rents, the higher taxes imposed on the property owner who is not entitled to any exemptions and pays the full tax on his/her assessed valuation.

 

Tenants are usually not renting by choice. They most likely can’t afford to buy a house and yet in the State of Florida they help subsidize the taxes of someone who owns a $500,000 home. How unfair and embarrassing is that?

 

4)      The sizeable S.O.H. exemptions trivialize the other exemptions available to some taxpayers in the State of Florida. They are:

 

a)      Widows and widowers who have not remarried ……………………….$500

b)      Blind persons …………………………………………………………...$500

c)      Veterans of military service with at least a 10% service disability……..$5,000

 

Compare these disability related exemptions with the $378,110 S.O.H. exemption, given to the resident in example 1 above, simply because he/she purchased and lived in the home since 1995. The S.O.H. exemption is not awarded because of any disability and is not based on income or ability to pay a fair share of the tax. Outrageous doesn’t begin to describe this unjust system of subsidies, which totally defies logic and common sense.

 

5)      Impact on the Real Estate market: Because of the huge sums of the S.O.H. exemptions, property taxes have become so personalized and customized to the current owner that they have become meaningless to a prospective buyer. Currently, when a Real Estate agent lists a property for sale on a local multiple listing service the property taxes paid by the present owner is automatically entered on the listing. If the seller’s property is homesteaded and he owned it for a few years, his property taxes are relevant to him and no one else.

 

In other words, because the S.O.H. exemptions, the dollar amount listed for property taxes on most listings for sale apply only to the present owner and are totally meaningless to a potential buyer. In fact, listing the present owner’s property taxes is misleading and could easily deceive a potential buyer into believing that the present owner’s property taxes are indicative of what his/her taxes will be if he/she purchases the property.

 

Using the property purchased in 1995 from example 1, if that owner uses a real estate agent to list his/her property for sale, the listing will indicate property taxes to be $2,480.48 when in fact no buyer on earth would qualify for this reduced tax amount.

 The minute any new buyer purchases that property, it will be taxed at the fully assessed value, which will bring the tax up to $10,550.74 and if the new buyer were homesteaded, the tax would be $10,140.60

 

How many potential buyers, who use the internet to view listings in Florida, are mislead by the low property taxes on listings for properties affected by the S.O.H. exemptions? How are they alerted to the fact that the tax amount on a listing could be meaningless to them and that their tax could be substantially higher? 

Aren’t we obligated to disclose this fact to all potential buyers and make them aware of what their property taxes will be once they purchase the house?

 

 

6)      Eventually, word will spread to potential out of State buyers and investors that because of      

the S.O.H. exemptions, purchasing a new property in the State of Florida will require them to assume a bigger share of the tax burden because they have to subsidize all the previous residents who purchased before them and who are enjoying those large exemptions at their expense. I would venture to say that other States that compete with Florida for new residents, i.e.: North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Arizona, Nevada, Texas etc. do not discriminate against new homeowners by making them pay a higher property tax to subsidize the lower property taxes of current residents. 

 

The real estate market in Florida will become less and less attractive to potential new buyers and investors as the save our homes exemptions grow larger and larger resulting in larger and larger taxes imposed on the newcomers to make up for the difference.

                         

PORTABILITY

The Save Our Homes system works in a similar way as a “pyramid scheme” whereby the people at the base of the pyramid benefit the most at the expense of the people at the top of the pyramid who benefit the least. Here is what “save our homes” pyramid looks like:

 

_  2006

___  2005

_____  2004
_______  2003
_________  2002
____________  2001
______________  2000
________________  1999
__________________  1998

_____________________  1997
_________________________  1996

_____________________________  1995

 

ß size of S.O.H. tax exemption à

 

 

Residents with homestead properties purchased in 1995 or earlier are at the base of the pyramid enjoying the largest exemptions and paying the smallest amount of tax per assessed dollar and are being subsidized by everyone above them. As you move up the pyramid, let’s say for a homestead property purchased in 2000, the tax reduction or the exemption is smaller and the owner is subsidizing the property owners below him/her and is being subsidized by all the property owners above him/her. Obviously, the new comers who purchased their properties recently, let’s say in 2006, are sitting on top of the pyramid paying the highest property tax per assessed dollar and subsidizing all the property owners below them.

 

Save our homes has created a dilemma for property owners who are at the bottom of the pyramid and are enjoying large exemptions but would like to move, within the State of Florida, for any number of reasons. Should they move, they will be placed at the top of the pyramid and will be paying the highest property tax per assessed dollar and will be subsidizing the taxes of all the homeowners under them and they don’t like it!

 

This is the height of hypocrisy. Those homeowners who have enjoyed lower taxes, by being subsidized by other newer homeowners for the past number of years, have not complained about the system. Now that they are being placed in the same position as any other new home buyer and finding that they also will be placed at the top of the pyramid and they will also be paying more than their fair share of the tax burden, they are all of a sudden crying foul.

 

They are now claiming that the system is broke and needs fixing. They want to be able to take those huge S.O.H. exemptions with them when they move to a new house. They know what happens when they are placed on top of the pyramid with no exemptions and having to subsidize all those homeowners under them. Their gripe is that they will end up paying a higher tax and that’s not fair!

 

Those who are pushing for portability are now paying less than their fair share of the tax burden and are happy to have someone else pay a higher tax to make up for the difference and don’t want to see this scenario change when they move, which will otherwise make them new homebuyers. 

 

In essence, I would like to see the Save our Homes system abolished basically for the same reasons that some homeowners would like to see portability of the S.O.H. exemptions. I don’t like the idea of a newcomer who buys a property in Florida, and who sits on top of that dreaded pyramid, paying a higher property tax to subsidize the tax of those established residents that bought their homes earlier. Supporters of the portability issue also don’t like to see themselves paying a higher property tax, and being placed at the top of that dreaded pyramid, to subsidize the tax of those who bought their homes earlier. The only difference between us is that they don’t mind if someone else is paying the higher property tax as a new homebuyer as long as it is not them! That is a selfish and hypocritical stance to take.

 

Save Our Homes has created a lot of inequities and a lot of problems with enormous long-term effect. To make S.O.H. portable will make a bad situation even worse. Supporters of the S.O.H. portability are disillusioned into thinking that the S.O.H exemptions that they are now enjoying, and that are being paid for by others, actually belongs to them and that they are entitled to take those exemptions with them when they move to a new house. 

To put in another way, they want to be excluded from being categorized as “new homebuyers” when they move to a new house because they will encounter the wrath of that good old  “Save Our Homes” and its unfair and inequitable consequences.

 

I say “what’s good for the goose should be good for the gander”. To start making exceptions to the “new homebuyer” rule for absolutely no reason other than to extend what are now clearly unfair exemptions to those who are benefiting from them and would like to make them lifetime exemptions, would be absurd.

 

If the system penalizes the new homebuyers, to the advantage of the existing one, let the penalty be applied evenly and consistently. I would rather see the penalty and this unfair system of subsidy totally removed instead of creating an artificial classification of “repeat or second time New Homebuyer” who will get substantial property tax subsidies that the “first time Homebuyer” is not only excluded from, but pays the cost of those subsidies. Let’s stop making these different classifications of taxpayers, which do not make any sense and create unfair and inequitable tax subsidies and penalties. 

 

The answer to the problem is really a simple one. Eliminate the subsidies and penalties and make comparably assessed properties pay the same tax (with the exception of the current disability related exemptions) If a cap is needed, to protect the taxpayers from increased government spending, consider a cap that would apply to all taxpayers and not one that favors some taxpayers and penalizes others. It’s ludicrous to say that we will reduce the property taxes of some taxpayers by having other taxpayers, who own comparable properties, pay a portion of their tax based on a seniority system! That is exactly what the “Save Our Homes” is doing now.

 

I don’t know how on earth this law was passed in 1992. But, it’s never too late to get rid of it. Certainly, it makes no sense to exacerbate the problem by allowing “portability”.

Subject:	[*] real property tax

First, let me say that I am proud to have you as Governor of Florida.  Thanks for doing such a fantastic job!
 
The purpose of this letter is to address the dramatic increase in property taxes these past few years and the effect it is having on our (those of us with a homestead) ability financially to move around within the state.
 
Is there not some way to adjust or freeze the tax base for a homesteaded homeowner when he sells his Florida house and buys another homestedable Florida house?  Hypothetically lets say my tax is now based on my house's original value of about $250,000 but the house is currently worth about $500,000.  If I retire and downsize (move into a smaller house) and pay $350,000 for the new smaller house, my taxes GO UP.  If I move into a house like mine in another part of the state and pay $500,000 (an even real estate exchange value), my taxes DOUBLE.  If I am a growing young family and need a bigger house for my children my taxes will MORE THAN DOUBLE and easily TRIPLE.  It appears that the only way to move out of a Florida homesteaded house without getting hit with a large tax increase is to move out of the state to a place that has a much lower tax base.  
 
I bought a small rental house a few years ago with plans to downsize into it when I retire but I can not afford to because the tax on that house (I paid half of what I did for my own home - I paid $130,000 for the small house, $250,000 for my large homesteaded house) has increased over $1,000 each year for the past two years making the final tax on it higher than I pay on my homesteaded house.  I would have a large tax INCREASE to downsize to a house I paid half the price of my current home for.  I can not afford to move into my own house.
 
This is hurting the economy by discouraging homesteaded Florida residents from selling and buying owner occupied Florida real estate.  Is there not something you can do to fix this problem and stimulate the real estate economy for Florida homesteaded residents?

I have been emailing the Governor for two years on this issue.  As you can see I am not alone on this issue.  

EVERY PROPERTY OWNER I TALK TO IS FRUSTRATED AND OUTRAGED AT HOW OUR TAXES ARE SO OUT OF CONTROL.  

IT IS THE GOVERNORS RESPONSIBILITY to solve the problem NOW and not next year!

Here is the letter to the editor.  See attachment for my proposal.

High property taxes killing home sales

Editor,

 

I'm Realtor with 1st Realty Network Inc. in West Palm Beach. I would like to express my concern, and the concern of others, about ever growing property taxes.

 

Let's be honest: It's a killer of home sales. As soon as my buyers hear the amount of the yearly tax bill they'd have to pay for their new home, they go into shock. Nothing scares them more than that number, next to maybe the property insurance cost in some cases. If they get a mortgage on the house, they know that paying the bank is like putting money back into their pocket because when they sell the house, they get money back.

 

Oftentimes, the mortgage payment almost equals the monthly tax amounts! It's outrageous! Paying high taxes is extremely expensive for most families, especially with children. This slows the real estate market tremendously!

 

I would like to find out if there is anyone I could contact in our state government to address this issue. I'm sure there other Realtors fighting for tax reductions. Please let me know. Thank you.

The Next Florida Disaster-Hurricane or Save our Homes?
 
My comments are with reference to the Herald article dated Sunday August 20, 2006 written by Maurice Tamman and Doug Sward.  First I compliment them on the accuracy of the article,  second I applaud people like Jim Ley, County Administrator,  who are striving for fiscal responsibility at the County level.  I would like to suggest to Florida elected officials that they wake up and face the fact that the non-resident property tax money pail is leaking rapidly.  Ask the realtors,  ask the appraisers how many owners are fraudulently taking advantage of "Save our Homes".  To expect the non-residents, who are providing the vast majority of tourist housing,  business owners and Floridians moving from their "save our Homes" house to a new home,  to pick up the entire tab for better schools,  hospital and fire, as well as modest County budget increases,  is unfair and will eventually lead to the demise of areas like Sarasota as an affordable winter destination.  For full time Florida residents to be getting a tax decrease while the non-residents are stuck with 15-17% increases once again this year, is unconscionable. When a "save our homes" waterfront condo is paying $3500 in taxes and the non- "save our homes" owner who is providing tourist housing is paying $14,000 for the same unit,  eventually they will quit renting or sell to someone who will not be renting.  The Hotel tax and the general sales tax provides a very essential revenue to Florida Counties and the State.  To threaten the tourist revenue of the State of Florida is incredibly stupid.

Subject:	Property Taxes

Dear Governor Bush: 

I recently received my notice of proposed property taxes from the Pinellas County Taxing Authorities.  You can imagine my surprise when I find that with the proposed budget changes by the local governments I will receive a 41% increase in actual tax paid for 2006.  This is because we are not Florida residents and not eligible for the homestead exemptions and the SOH amendment which would limit the assessed value increase.  We purchased this property from my wife's parents when it became necessary for them to go into an assisted living facility and we wanted a place close to them so we could be there when needed.  We have come to enjoy Florida, but I find that based on the current laws we obviously are not very welcome at least when measured by the tax laws that affect us.  I have a home in Colorado with a market value of about $475,000.  My tax bill without any exemptions is about $2700.  The market value on my tax notice for the Florida condo is $275,000 but the proposed tax is $5889 or about 2.2 times what I pay in Colorado.  I realize that when comparing states tax structures it is necessary to look at the total picture, but this seems excessive and I am one who generally votes to support local government when requesting rate increases.  This seems even more onerous when I find that when I am in Florida many local governments and private entities make me pay more or exclude my participation because I am not a full time resident.  My neighbor with the same condo has a proposed tax bill of approximately $2200 because he has the homestead and other applicable exemptions.

With these types of tax increases I will not be able to afford to own a property in Florida.  Perhaps this is the intent of the laws currently being administered.  I am sure there are many others that find themselves in the same situation.  I am hopeful that this email will reach you.  I realize that you receive many communications and that your staff must assist, but I do hope that they are making you are aware of these issues.

Sincerely.

Subject:	Charlotte County Property Tax Increase

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
Please do something about about the TRIM notices sent out this week in Charlotte County.  I'm on a fixed income and it's very difficult for my husband and me to get by as it is.  Like a lot of people, we are struggling to pay for food, utilities, and medicine.  We never get to go out and do anything.  It's out of the question for us to go out to eat at anywhere more expensive than Wendy's and we'd better not do that very often.  
 
I'm going to have an extremely difficult time paying the $1541 that I owe on the home in which I live.  I own another place besides the one in which I live.  My Mother lived in it up until last September when she passed away.  It's a rundown 1990 mobile home in a very depressed section just south of Punta Gorda.  It's in the mobile home portion of South Punta Gorda Heights on Lime Dr.  There are rundown and vacant mobiles damaged by Charley on this street and the adjacent streets.  Drug use is rampant.  Hurricane Charley tore the carport off and blew away the shed.  It damaged the roof, the pipes, and bent the frame.  The insurance paid out $15,000, then cancelled the policy.  We cannot insure it now because it was totalled and paid out.  No one will insure it.  Last year, the Charlotte Co. Appraiser appraised this dump at $30547.  This year it is appraised at $44975.  I don't see how it is worth anymore than the land upon which it sets.  After all, I can't sell it.  No one wants to live in that part of town.  Who in their right mind would buy a home that they couldn't insure?  What bank would provide a loan for an uninsurable home?  I can't rent it out because I'm afraid that I might be liable if something were to happen to a tenant.  I'm stuck with it.  Last year, I went to the property appraiser's office and pled my case.  The appraiser had absolutely no sympathy for me or my plight (and I'm sure the plight of a lot of other folks trying to get by) and effectively told me that that was just the way things were.  
 
There's a public hearing being held on 14 Sep 06 to address this issue.  If there is something you could do to help the people in Charlotte County who are still suffering from the losses incurred in Hurricane Charley, please, please do so.  Also, I hear that some people up in Tallahassee want to expand the homesteader's exemption to $50000.  That would be a huge help to me and others like me.  
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I am a registered Republican voter.  I voted for you and I voted for your brother.  
 
Sincerely,
Leslie Lampo

Governor Bush, my name is Peggy Arnold and I own property in Davenport, Florida.  The address is 533 Venetian Way.  I own lots 8 & 9.  The tax notice of proposed property taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments for Polk County has increased more than 50% from last year.  Last year property tax was $145.38.  This year , if proposed budget changes is made will be $299.44.  If no budget change it will be $257.21.  
This is because the Property Appraisers have raised the value from $8,000.00 to $17,000.00 for one year. This is a low income area and not much has changed for the past years.  My parents bought the property they lived on 53 years ago, and my brother lives there now and my sister has a small place on my folks old place.  We bought some lots behind my mother's house because the people who owned the property rented it out to drunks and they shot at my mother's house and kept her upset.  The lots are 50' x 100'.  
It was on a clay road in the country.  There are trailers and small homes in this area, with white and Mexican families.  It is still not a good neighborhoor because of the drugs and alcohol problems.  My brother and sister still live there, my brother works at Wal-Mart and works as a stock clerk.  My sister is disabled and goes to mental health for treatment.  She draws about $600.00 per month.  If something isn't done, these two will not be able to maintain themselves for much longer.   The present government in this state seems to be for big money and investors and has forgotten that orange pickers still live in this place.  
Please help.   We are voters and always have been.   But, we are fed up with what has happened to our place and no one representing us in government.   Election is coming up, we won't be voting for any of the present folks.                   Peggy Arnold

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am not in favor of a new baseball stadium in Sarasota.  
I am not in favor of an increased bed tax to fund a baseball stadium.
 
I request further clarification regarding "corporate leases" that are to provide almost $10 million toward this new baseball stadium project. Who are these corporations? Is there a business plan for this portion of the baseball stadium project? Where are these leases? Is there anything in writing to support statements made by stadium promoters about corporate leases? - Please tell me where to find them - thank you. 
 
Property taxes and insurance rates are climbing so high, so quickly, property owners like myself are unable to pass on these huge new cost spikes to our renters. ANY additional tax is too much at this time. 
 
I own three rental properties in Sarasota. None of my tenants go to ball games and neither do I.

Subject:	Strange goings on in Lee County

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush,

 

While my wife and I don’t reside in Florida we do own a timeshare property in Fort Lauderdale and a lot in Lehigh Acres – and we spend a lot of time in Orlando and cruising out of Fort Lauderdale and Miami.  So hopefully you will listen to our situation.

 

We just received our TRIM Notice from the Lee County Property Assessor.  The assessed value of our “unimproved lot on a gravel road” went from $16,500.00 in 2005 to $40,000.00 in 2006.  We contacted a realtor to see what our lot is worth now and were advised it might sell between $19,000-21,000.  So we are being billed for taxes on twice the real market value of our lot.  We also learned that the “Save Our Homes” assessment limitation (legislation authored by the Lee County Property Assessor) limits annual assessment increases on homestead properties to 3% or the CPI, whichever is lower.

 

The percentage increase on our property value has been a bit higher than 3%…

 

2003

1500

    0.00%

2004

3900

160.00%

2005

16500

323.08%

2006

40000

142.42%

 

Obviously we are “absentee owners.”  We can’t vote, we can’t take advantage of the benefits of the taxes we pay to Lee County.  Sounds like taxation without representation!  We do understand that homestead exemptions are used throughout the country but this situation seems very one-sided.  

 

It is also very curious how “real market values” could hyper inflate one year and than deflate at depression levels the next – yet property is taxed at the highly inflated value.  Sounds pretty fishy to me…

 

I wanted to bring this to your attention so you might take whatever action you see fit.  We have always thought of Florida as our second home and looked forward to spending our retirement years there.  But this situation makes us rethink that decision.

Dear Mr. Gilreath,

Let me first introduce myself and briefly review my situation.  In March 2004, as a newly retired baby boomer I purchased a condominium located at 2937 South Atlantic Avenue, Unit 706, Daytona Beach Shores, FL  32118.  I was planning retirement at that time and I wanted to return to Florida as my permanent residence.  To date, for numerous reasons my wife and I have been unable to move there from the Atlanta, Georgia area, however we have been able to spend a number of months each year.  

With that information as a background, as I received the latest “Notice of Proposed Property Taxes” I was “SHOCKED” at the proposed increase and percent of increase from last year to this year.  Our tax bill for last year was $6,994.39 and this year’s proposed taxes will increase to $9,407.75 or a 34.5% increase in Property Taxes.  Imagine …. A 35% increase!!!!!  The curious fact of this is that the taxes should be increasing as property values increase BUT not at the rates shown on this latest notice.  There is not ANYTHING that can substantiate an increase as proposed -  it is government gone awry.  

Our plans for permanent residence have been placed on hold, awaiting the outcome of where Florida is going with property taxes.  I would propose that you have several thousand “new retirees” in a similar situation.

 

Sincerely,

As an owner of two condominiums in Daytona Shores, I am extremely concerned and distressed about our county being the third highest taxed county in all of Florida. We are double that of surrounding counties. We need to make corrections in those rates that reflect fair and more moderate taxes for all Florida citizens. 
 
We will not be able to attend the County Council Budget Hearings in September but did want our voices heard. We will be following up on your actions and will continue to lobby at all levels for changes in our Volusia County Taxes. If this is not addressed, I fear you will be loosing residential and resort owners as they cannot afford to own property there.
 
Please put me on your email listing to keep us up on the developments.

  Dear Mr. Bush,
    My name is John Rongo, and my wife is Patricia. We bought a house in West Palm Beach in the town of Jupiter.  I was hoping to retire there, but the state of Florida keeps raising my taxes.  I think its ridiculous how the state of Florida can makes the tax rules like this. I bought the house two years ago and was paying 4,600.00 dollars which jumped to 8,300.00 dollars in one year, and raised me again to  9,100.00 dollars. There are people that have the same house in the neighborhood and are paying 5-6 thousand.  This is not fare.  We believe and are hoping that something will be done about this. This is just causing people to leave the state of Florida, and move else where.
                                                                            Thank you for your time,

Dear Mr. Bush:
Well, that's something. But it doesn't even address the condominiums and the ridiculous rapping of the folks that live in them. At the Hills of Inverrary in Lauderhill, Florida, those 233 residents are facing in increase in their premium from $186,000 to almost $700,000. You do the division. 
 
Obviously, you didn't read my letter or nobody gave it to you. This electronic answer is not good. WE ARE PEOPLE at the other end. There is a condo that had 22 million dollars in damage. To date, one year later...they have only received 6 million to fix it. Governor. In your state of Florida, there are people, human beings that work hard and have familles living in their cars because their homes have not be taken care of.
 
It makes me want to vomit. I would love for you to see this. I know that your heart would open and you would get extremely upset and call a special session to immediately freeze everything that's happening. 
 
PLEASE!

 Dear Governor Bush,

 

            I believe the state needs to act quickly to expand the 1982 Homestead Exemption amount of $25,000 to a more realistic amount based on the current median value of owning a home in Florida.  I have been a resident since March of 1979.  I believe that when the amount was originally established it was about 50% of the median home value.

 

  I received my 2006 Proposed Property Tax estimate of $1,375, which includes an increase of $775.05 after my Homestead Exemption.  This is a 129.1% increase over 2005.  I purchased the property, built in 1979, for $85,000 on January 27, 2005.  My current Assessed value is $86,941; because of similar property sales and re-assessments requesting a re-appraisal is probably pointless.   I realize now that I lost the “Save our homes” cap of 3% by relocating.

 

My purpose in relocating here from Pembroke Pines, FL was to scale down my expenses.   The townhouse I purchased in 1988 had an assessed value of 65,690, sold for $152,000, which enabled my purchase of this property.  The 2003 taxes on that home were $981.

 

            .  My monthly income, from Social Security is $1,288 a 4% increase from last year.  When I purchased this property my maintenance payments were $291.  They raised by 25.4% to $365 within fourteen months, mainly due to Insurance.  We know that will increase substantially next March.

            

            I live in a duplex in Kings Point so I cannot take advantage of the new inspection program or obtain funds for increasing the safety of my home.   If my 86-year-old roof mate does nothing to fortify her home, and she loses her roof mine goes also, and I have no recourse other than the condo to replace it.   Doesn’t say much for protecting my possessions and me.

 

Help, please.

Dear Governor and Mayor
 
For your Disaster Prevention and Attention officers and RISK CONTROL, we include an English translation of the COMPARION between Actuarial Models.
 
The proposed Model is clear, is affordable and the initial surplus is reasonable. The other models demmand capital in the order of 50 times de mean annual loss, that makes no-sense (with an interest of 5% that means 2.5 the mean annual loss in “opportunity cost”!
 
A reasonable provision can be made and must be promoted, and with a consistent model the optimum retention before insurance can be easily determined.

Dear Mr Bush
I own a home in  Port Charlotte Florida and I have to protest about the number of taxes I have to pay on my house .I do not have the homestead exception as I  am a Canadian snowbird. My taxes have gone from 3200..00 in 2005 to 4600.00 in 2006. I cannot sell my house because of the market so I am caught between a rock and a hard place. The homesteaders taxes can only go up 3% per year and I feel this is totally unfair to the rest of us who are paying for that 3%.Please help!!!

Subject:	Walton County Taxes

Dear Governor Bush:

I am a Realtor and ECAR member in Walton County. I own several properties throughout the county and have been stunned by my new proposed taxes.  The vast majority of the increases are due to re-appraisals (based on unrealistic market prices) of the properties' respective values. This puts an incredible burden on property owners, particularly those that hold land or non-homesteaded dwellings.

This could destroy an already dire market. As property owners throughout Florida and the Panhandle struggle with incredible insurance increases, higher borrowing costs and a difficult overall market.....such taxes will limit any market recovery and financially cripple untold numbers of property owners.  Watch as prospective property buyers flee when tax costs are revealed by the sellers and the combination of taxes, insurance and other misc. costs blow apart dreams of buying here. In essence, it almost seems as if we are trying to stop any future development and seriously wound any who currently own property here.  However, many Florida counties have acknowledged this problem and have decided to reduce tax rates and/or re-visit  the appraised values; particularly in light of this
difficult real estate and general business environment. 

I am writing you in order to ask how we can bring reason back to this situation.......to reach the Commissioners, the Appraiser, the various entities (School Board, Fire Dept., etc., etc.) within the county and request a sanity check.  Our first open county meeting is on September 11th at the S. Walton Annex, the next is on the 25th : we don't have much time to act.

Thank you for listening....I believe my opinion is reflected by thousands of current voters and potential future voters in Walton County.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Universal Healthcare Insurance

Dear Governor,

 

I am completing a research paper for a Health Law class at a major University. There are five questions that I put together on the issue of Universal Health Coverage for Floridians and Americans. It is a subject that touches our hearts as well as our pockets. Please answer them to learn about your views.

 

1. According to a recent publishing by the Research Institute on Social and  Economic Policy, Center for Labor Research and Studies at Florida International University, June 2006 issue, by Bruce Nielssen, Emily Eisenhauser and Yue Zhang, Titled "Healthcare Coverage and Employment Staus in Florida: A Report", 18.5% of Florida's population is uninsured totaling over 3 million people. In another study published on February 10, 2006 titled " The Case for Universal Health Care" by Kao-Ping Chua, AMSA Jack Rutledge Fellow 2005-2006, there are more than 45 million Americans across the U.S. that do not have any insurance at all. This problem is now affecting more and more middle income families and just not the low income families as before. 80% of the uninsured are hard working Americans who cannot afford the high cost of insurance. 

 

As the Governorof the great State of Florida what are your views of providing universal healthcare for all Americans especially Floridians?

 

2. A Legislative bill called "Fair Share is currently moving through the Florida State House of Representatives and the Senate.  This bill will mandate for-profit companies that have 10,000 employees or more to pay 9% of their payroll costs towards employee's healthcare, (HB 813; introduced by Representative Susan Bucher) and the Senate (SB 1618; introduced by Senator Walter "Skip" Campbell) in the 2006 session.

There are other countries who have successfully provided their citizens with low cost or free health care. What is your views of using an external model for a best practice in the United States?

 

3. The United States is the only Country in the Western World not offering Universal Healthcare coverage to its citizens. There are several proposals supported by some of the Democratic Presidential Candidates including one by Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois and Al Sharpton. They support a single-payer system to cover everyone.

Is this something that you envision as a possible model?

 

4. What do you think about the idea of using large group discounts from HMO's as a possible solution to covering our States needs with the State covering the uninsured? 

 

5. What is your position in introducing or supporting a bill in the Florida State Congress for a State Universal Health Insurance Policy that is not influenced by the American Medical Association?

 

Thank you for your valuable time.

Subject:	Criminal Tax Increase for Seasonal Residents of  Broward County

Received my proposed Property Tax bill for year 2007 and was stuned by the amount shown.  It's true that I'm a "snowbird" and Florida is not my permanent residence but must I be penalized for this?  It's not fair that a homesteader receives an approximate 3% tax increase and is also eligible for a $25,000-$50,000 deductible on the value of their property whereas a seasonal resident is not entitled to the same tax shelter.  This is very unjust and something must be done in order to eliminate these excessive increases year after year.  I'm sure that you are aware that, if not for the snowbirds, both Canadian and U.S., your economy would suffer greatly as we do contribute during our stay in Florida.  You must also understand that it is not possible for me to attend the Public Hearing in September as the plane ticket is unaffordable.  I am hoping that you will be able to influence the proper chanels involved so that this terrible and unfair situation will be eliminated once and for all.  Please let me hear from you.

Dear Governor Bush,

    If you somehow read these e-mails.  You have been a great Governor and sorry that you can't run again.  I do not know who you are endorsing for Governor but maybe you can pass this on to him to address in his campaign speeches and in the meantime maybe you can explain something and do something about it.

I'm not quite sure how the taxes work on property but I do know in Suwannee County that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and one thing that is not helping is the way we the poor and middle class are paying all the taxes.  Seems the large property owners are getting a huge tax break on paying property taxes.    I just received my proposed tax notice and almost had a heart attack as it jumped from $14,000 to $76,000. Tax apprasier claims my house was just put there and not on the prior tax rolls.  Hello but I bought the property in 1993 and the house although needing extensive work was on the property when I bought it.  Anyway it's been appraised at $63,000 which is outragious since it's just a plain simple wood house with alum siding.  So while appealing it to the review board I pulled up other property in my area and learned that large property owners aren't paying the taxes that we small owners are.  One example and it's all over this county is a man owns 120 acres and the MV is $360,000, AG Land Value brings it down to $27,000.  It's planted in pine trees and he derives around $10,000 a month or more from the straw from that and the other acreage he owns.  His house which is bigger than mine is valued at about half of what mine is.  By the time he gets homestead and  Assessed value it's  down to $23,000 while me with my 1 acre after homestead is $44,000 and my income is less than $10,000 a year.  Now what's wrong with this picture? The lower and middle income familes are being taxed out of their homes.  Do you realize how hard it will be for me to pay $800 in taxes while the jerk with plenty of money will be paying around $300.  Something needs to be done about how this property is being valued don't you think?  Who makes these decisions? How are values assesed on AG when there is nothing being farmed.  Just pine trees on it that produce pine straw and later the trees will be cut.  I don't think people realize just how much they are getting the shaft while the large land owners are getting by with paying next to nil and some nil.  I agree that over a certain age you should get more exemptions etc. but another example is my ex-in-laws also own large acreages  of property. Husband is dead she is in a nursing home and one of their properties 76 acres with brick home,MV $290,000 and has an assessed value of $84,000 and it's exempt.  Well she no longer lives in her home but does hold life estate on it.  This property also is producing income from pine straw and way more than the limits on income after a certain age to be exempt. Now whether her son who rakes the straw is actually writing a check to her is another story, but he used to.  Again what's wrong with this picture and who should be notified to investagate what's going on in the county and probably other counties in Florida? Hmmm wonder how Lamar Jenkins property is valued?

Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully doing something about it if you did read it.

Dear Governor and Mayor



“Ernest” is menacing Florida at the very beginning of the hurricanes. It
will be probably a tropical storm but even so, for the local governments
in terms of power line fixing, etc.  And for the economy means that the
business looks for other places for new companies or expansion of the
actual ones.



Please, put pus in contact with your RISK ANNALIST and RISK FINANCING
people (This same e-mail)



Annex you will find a comparison between the last models in the actuarial
literature and the extended SEAL-INGESISTEMAS one.



This solution (well defined and well understood FIRS LOSS FUNDS) is the
answer for hurricanes, tornados and forest fires. It is in use in wind
damages to banana plantations, in transportation in guerilla-infested
zones, in power towers an oil-pipes blowing. The governments must promote
them and consider tax incentives during the firs years.



The annex figures will show you how more affordable is one of this Funds
with proper models and controls, and to use auto-insurance optimally (up
to the point on the “shadow cost”) and Stop Loss re-insurance for second
and third lines.

Apreciados amigos:



Vayamos a la VERDAD, a la comparación de resultados entre los diferentes
modelos de VIDA ESPERADA DEL FONDO (o si prefieren: distribución de T, el
tiempo hasta el primer déficit).



Desde 1940 Lundberg hizo un enorme aporte conceptual a la racionalidad y
medida del RIESGO. Pero su modelo, ampliamente demostrado y base de los
posteriores, es UNA DESIGUALDAD, un simple acotamiento. Si bien es “del
lado de la seguridad” queda por definir qué tan ineficaz puede ser en
muchas condiciones.



Desde entonces y en especial desde los computadores personales (80s)
asistimos a un enorme esfuerzo científico que trata de llevar a LA
IGUALDAD, a determinar la probabilidad de supervivencia. Todos ellos
desafortunadamente viciados por  falta de rigor en el manejo de las
Integrales Impropias.



Ya a fines del siglo pasado, los Actuarios buscaron ayuda en otras
disciplinas, concretamente en la Teoría de Colas y sus funciones de
reabastecimiento; también en los modelos físicos de Movimiento Browniano.
De nuestro lado INGESISTEMAS insiste en los muy buenos resultados
obtenidos en la línea de solución de H. Seal que hemos generalizado para
superávit inicial no nulo, para incluir el valor del dinero en el tiempo,
para analizar horizonte temporal finito e infinito y para incluir el
Reaseguro más eficaz que es el “Stop-loss”.



A continuación encontraran la comparación de Lundberg para los mismos
casos reportados por Dickson & Waters )U. de Victoria y de Edimburgo), a
saber: capitales iniciales de 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 y 50 períodos; Factores de
Estabilidad (teta o “realative security loads” de .1 y .25; distribución
de extensión exponencial de media y parámetro 1: distribución de
intensidad Poisson de parámetro (lambda) 1.



NINGUNO DE LOS DEMÁS MODELOS ESTUDIA EXPLÍCITAMENTE EL INTEREÉS SOBRE EL
FONDO, para facilitar la comparación haremos inicialmente lo mismo aunque
insistimos que no se debe restar de un capital en pesos de hoy los
siniestros muy distantes sin descontarlos.



Los resultados anexos casi no requieren comentario: baste decir que  donde
Lundberg prueba que el tiempo es mayor que, los otros modelos (Excepto el
de INGESISTEMAS) dan resultados menores; donde es obvio que con un aporte
periódico de .25 veces la media se tiene mayor superávit que con .1, dan
frecuentemente menor vida.



Y en EFICIENCIA QUE DECIR: para u0=30 y teta=.25, Dickson&Waters dan vidas
de 100 y 120; Lundberg dice que es mayor que 800 y la realidad es 884
MILLONES DE AÑOS o sea recursos inmovilizados inútilmente.



Pero ésta es la primera parte de la historia: incluyamos un rendimiento
tan discreto como .05 por año, en la parte final del estudio.  Los tiempos
en algunos casos disminuyen frente a no-interés pero siempre mayores que
Lundberg, se deben al DESCUENTO de capitales alcanzados en el futuro
distante donde ya no hay  déficit posible.



Se observa que los resultados son UTILES, difícilmente se requiere más de
.1 de Estabilidad y no tienen sentido práctico capitales iniciales de 50
veces la media (aplicados al caso colombiano, serían autoseguros tan
costosos como el seguro mismo y con la inmovilización de 3 a 4 veces el
valor de un vehículo) es tal la diferencia que debimos repetir nuestros
resultados para valores de u0 entre 0 y 15.



Una vida media de 100 es excelente: incluso podemos considerar una de 20
años, si se entiende que el administrador del fondo no es un sujeto
PASIVO, que sabe hacer correcciones y que todo lo que requiere es que es
un plazo prudente antes del déficit. ESTO SE LOGRA EN EL FONDO CON
CAPITALES INICIALES DE 4 y 5.5 VECES LA PERDIDA MEDIA, con cargas de .1 y
.25  respectivamente.



CON FONDOS DE PRIMERA PERDIDA CLAROS, ENTENDIDOS, COMPROBABLES, SI HAY
OFERTA DE SEGUROS se puede entrar a calcular la retención o deducible
óptimo que depende del “costo de oportunidad del dinero” para el
asegurado.



Esta es la solución para TERRORISMO (Voladura de torres de energía y
oleoductos, aviones), para DAÑOS DE HURACANES Y TORNADOS (reparación de
redes), PARA VIENTOS EN BANANERAS. Para enfermedades costosas (diálisis y
transplantes renales, quimio y radio terapias) y para CONTAGIO (Sida).



Y ESPECIALMENTE ES LA SOLUCIÓN PARA CIUDADES QUE HAN VISTO EMIGRAR SU
GENTE COMO NUEVA ORLEANS, QUE HAN VISTO PARALIZADA  LA INVERSIÓN Y EL
CRECIMIENTO. LAS AUTORIDADES DEBEN PROMOVER ESTA CLASE DE FONDOS Y DARLES
INCENTIVOS TRIBUTARIOS MIENTRAS SE DOTAN, PARA GARANTIZAR EMPLEO Y NUEVOS
IMPUESTOS A FUTURO.

Subject:	[*] PROPERTY TAX DISTRESS

Dear Governor Bush;
	We, as senior citizens, along with a couple hundred thousand more in this county have the same problem. Last year, in trying to downsize to a smaller house that is more efficient, and economical, are paying high penalties for doing this. Our original home that we moved from has been for sale for 10 months with no sight of selling in the immediate future. (and yes, it is priced right, not overpriced). Our original homestead came off to transfer over to our smaller, more efficient home. Now we are saddled with paying 2 property tax bills for the amount of over $6,500. How are we supposed to pay this? And especially our old home which the taxes were quadrupled and is sitting empty for the last 10 months, incurring no impact to this county. Don't tell me about the possibility of the homestead going up to $50,000., because that is not going to help anything. (the market value will increase by $25,000 by next year, so that would wipe that out immediately.) That will be no help. There is no possible way seniors like us can pay these high property tax bills when downsizing. So, you say, we should stay in our larger, less efficient home, and not use the extra 2 bedrooms that we never use? So, that's how we get rewarded for downsizing, and using up less energy in this state? What is going to be done about this fiasco with all these home owners with their properties up for sale that can't sell, and paying on 2 property tax bills until one property is sold? What do you suggest we do? How can we pay these 2 property tax bills, when we don't have that kind of money, due to our old home not being sold yet, and don't see it being sold any time soon because of this slump in sales?
I would appreciate a response. I emailed Ginny Browne Waitte twice, and got no response. I know who I'll be voting for in the next election.
Sincerely,
Lynn Thomas
please respond with an answer to our predicament.

Dear Mrs. Bush,
My name is Brenda Cochran, and I am writing you concerning Clay County Victim Service Center. The Center is in the process of being established. The Center would be a facility where victims (adults/children) of sex crimes could come to recieve their medical/forensic examinations after the horrible experience of being raped and/or sexually assaulted.
 

Law enforcement records indicate that in 2005, crimes of sexual violence and abuse against women and children in Clay County reached a new high:

 

•Over 50 rapes.

•Over 75 cases of child molestation and other “non-forcible” sexual offenses against children.

•Over 100 cases of “forcible sexual assault on children.

•Over 175 cases of physical abuse against children.

 

These figures represent only those crimes that were reported to law enforcement and showed sufficient evidence to warrant review by prosecutors.  The total number of 2005 “special victim” cases investigated by detectives in Clay County is in excess of 600.

 

Additionally, as a result of state budget cuts, the Child Protection Team (CPT) was recently forced to close their Clay County office and make reductions in staff.  At present, one CPT case worker is assigned to Clay County and is being temporarily housed in an extra room at the Clay County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Orange Park Operations Center.  These CPT case workers work closely with law enforcement and other state agencies to conduct forensic interviews of victimized children, offer services to families, and conduct forensic physical examinations of abused children when necessary. Clay County children currently have to take an hour to hour and a half trip, just to have their forensic examination done. This is an added traumatic ride to a situation that is a life-long changing event.

 

Adults also have to ride an hour to an hour and a half to recieve a medical/forensic exam.

 

This could all be avoided is we had additional funds to open this office and have it operational. WE ARE SO CLOSE!!

 

We have been awarded about $150,000 on a reinbursement basis by our local County Commisioners Office. However, we are still short about $50,000 per year of being in a position to open our doors to the public.

 

This is the reason for my letter to you. I am writing you to request (BEG) that you help us find a way to get the monies needed for this essential facility. Of course, I am not asking you fund this personally, but simply to help us find additional funding for this most necessary facility. 

 

I understand that this is an unconventional way to approach you but, I have the utmost respect for you and your husband, and believe that you too, are committed to making sure Floridians truest needs will be met.

 

Please respond whether you are able to help us or not. Thank you so much for at least reading my e-mail.

Dear Governer,
As much as we like living in South Florida, we are forced to move due to the rise in "home owners insurance. We can no longer afford it. It breaks my heart to have to leave such a beautiful state. Salaries do not support the home prices anymore and taxes are extremely high. Is there anything the state of Florida can do for its' citizens so that we can stay. Thank you in advance.

Subject:  Property assessment and taxes

 

My husband I are retirees from Canada, who have been wintering in Florida for some years now.  While homesteaders have seen their taxes increase by about 3% our situation is drastically different.  As residents of Deerfield Beach, our property taxes have gone up by as much as 50-60%.  

The price of our units has been unrealistically inflated by real estate people.  Out of 8800 units more than 800 are up for sale and sadly nothing is moving.  

Needless to say this is putting tremendous burden on seniors who are on fixed income and are finding themselves in a no win situation.  Under such circumstances, how many of us can afford to keep coming to Florida is highly questionable?

The County is to hold public hearings next month, but Snowbirds do not “migrate” until November so we’ll be excluded from active participation again.  

As a group we are beneficial contributors to Florida’s economy and as such urge you to seriously consider our request to withdraw the proposed tax increases for “seasonal’ property owners.

In light of Ernesto’s march to Florida, this issue becomes more critical by the hour.

Subject:	idea for medicaid reform

To the Honorable Mr Jeb Bush.....dear governor  Bush I work in a hospital emergency room on the east coast of Florida in the registration department. What I do is register patients who present themselves to the ER for treatment taking demographic information such as name date of birth insurance and so on. What I see in my area which is Volusia county are a high number of people with no insurance and medicaid. What bothers me is the abuse of the medicaid system that all our tax dollars support. I have no problem with legitimate use for injury or disabled or true emergency situations but what I see too much of are people with what we call the "gold card" coming in for cough and cold symptoms and other minor ailments.It seems to us they don't want to spend 6 dollars for cough medicine so they come to us for free as they see it.  And its the same folks week after week. What I would suggest and I hope you can consider it is a limit of 6 visits per year for medicaid recipients unless disabled then there would be no limit. I believe this would save tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of medicaid dollars and force these folks to use these cards wisely and not abuse them. They are not even attempting home remedy for minor ailments..they come to the ER "gold card" in hand within two hours of a minor symptom clogging up our emergency rooms delaying treatment to people in real need. I would say half if not more than half of patients we see on a daily basis are indigent folks with ailments that most people would never consider going to an emergency room if they didn't have medicaid. I have no problem helping those who need it but I do have a problem with people who take advantage of our system and our tax payer dollars. Again limiting non emergent visits may be an idea you can work with to stop the waste of medicaid dollars. Thanks for your time..sincerely Rob Hasty  lifetime Florida resident

 Dear Governor Bush, 
 
 
             I would like to bring to your attention an important matter that I think needs to be addressed not only in this State but in the entire country as well, and I'm not sure how to go about the process of change.  We all are aware of the rising costs of healthcare throughout the United States and that millions of people either don't have health insurance, or can't afford it.  It is projected that by the year 2010, the health and wellness industry will be a trillion dollar industry.  Thousands of people every day are looking for alternative methods of treatment and they're using natural botanicals or herbs that have been scientifically tested that have been proven to help improve and in a high percentage of cases, even eliminate the physical conditions that people have had.  With more and more people everyday searching for ways to eliminate the usage of prescription medications that can be more harmful to the body then being helpful, I believe it's time for insurance companies, and even Medicaid to take a serious look at covering the costs of a person's choice to use natural products, and help cover the costs of these products to people who struggle with either no insurance or they're on fixed income.  In the long run, I believe people will have more improvements with their health thus costing Medicaid and insurance companies less money to help cover healthcare.     
 
         To illustrate my point, I talked to a woman yesterday in Michigan who is interested in trying the health product that I market with my own independent business.  This is a woman who's in her 50's, she had a heart attack in 1996, has had 2 strokes, has been told she has MS although she believes its Limes Disease because she was bitten by a tick and was never able to remove it, and she has type 2 diabetes.  She has a 17 year old son who has internal brain damage and has been told he's precancer, and here's the sad part.  This woman is on Social Security Disability where she receives $600 a month and her son receives $294.  Her rent is $500 a month, the rest goes to pay her bills, she receives food from food pantries and she wants an alternative choice of a natural treatment but knows that Medicaid won't cover it because it's NOT A DRUG?  Ms Sherrill, its a sad day in this country when Medicaid will cover the costs of drugs that kill hundreds of thousands of people a year, but when natural products are available that have proven with medical documentaion to substantiate that these products are more helpful to maintaining total wellness solutions, that they go ignored!  I don't see how Medicaid or thousands of insurance companies who provide health insurance can continue to deny a patients method of treatment by denying to cover these costs, when this industry is on pace to become a trillion dollar industry in just 4 yrs.  Do you have any ideas on how to address the need for insurance companies to acknowledge that natural methods of treatment are not only validated, but should be covered under a person's healthcare plan?  I just think it's sad to know that we live in the greatest country in the world and yet we have people who live on less then $900 a month and yet can't get the proper healthcare coverage that they prefer.

We would like to protest our Notice of Proposed Property Taxes since we can’t be there in person.

 

We believe your tax system is way beyond what is customary and accepted practice and discriminatory to those who own a second home.  

 

According to this notice, our home went up in value $50,000 this year.  From talking to several people in New Smyrna Beach, some of them real estate representatives, they say the price of homes in New Smyrna actually decreased in value this year.

 

The number you put down as “assessed value” is only a number.  It doesn’t mean anything if buyers aren’t willing to pay that amount for the property.  

 

But I think the problem is deeper than that.  The problem is the millage you are charging is exorbitant.  Our home is one of the least expensive on the island and if our tax bill is going to almost $6,000, how can anyone on a fixed income afford to live there?  

 

I don’t know anyone in New Smyrna Beach who is under taxed, even those who have been there for years.  I think the taxes on those who bought there in the past 5 years should be rolled back, more in line with the homesteaded amount.  

 

We are living on a fixed income and had planned to spend our latter years there, but if our taxes go up the amount specified this year, we will have to join the ranks of thousands of others in the area and put our home on the market.  

 

Please help us and others before it is too late.

To The Honorable Jeb Bush: 

Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns regarding HB7121 and the installation and financial burden it is placing on the 778 units contained in the 9 Associations that I manage.

I am the Community Association Manager at the Federation of Sea Towers in St. Petersburg, Fl.  I have managed and maintained the physical property here for the past 25 years.  Past experience with tropical storms and hurricanes, although not as fierce as recently, has taught us how to protect our property.

We are in Evacuation Level A, which being the first level evacuated in the event of a hurricane, is mandatory and leaves the property evacuated.  When the mandatory evacuation order is given by Pinellas County, we begin our procedure to evacuate, protect and secure our community, which includes but is not limited to, locking the elevators on the top floors and shutting them down and turning the power off until the evacuation order is withdrawn.  This is done to protect the elevator cars and to prevent extensive damage that was experienced during one of the recent hurricanes when the elevators were left running after evacuation.  Wind and rain caused severe and very costly damage to the elevator cars, leaving them inoperable until repairs could be made.  Having a generator to supply power to elevators that are not operable is absurd.

Being between 5 and 7 feet above sea level, places our community in a flood zone.  Because of insurance regulations, we have been forced to insure with FEMA.  My agent tells me that because it is not possible to incorporate the generators into the structure of our buildings, that my very expensive flood insurance will not provide coverage for my equally expensive generators (which will not work if flooded) that will sit in front of my beautifully landscaped buildings, making them less appealing and reducing the value of our first floor units.

These are just 2 concerns that I thank you for taking the time to consider.  Please also take into consideration the burden that the cost of not only purchasing and installing these generators and the many hidden costs involved with their upkeep, will add to the already exorbitant cost of insurance on a mutli - million dollar community such as ours.  A burden that is being placed upon voters who worked hard all of their lives in the hopes of a good retirement, only to have it taken from them, not only here at Sea Towers but at other communities in our fine state.  

On behalf of the residents and Boards of Directors of  The Federation of Sea Towers Owner’s Associations, Inc., I humbly ask you to reconsider HB 7121.

 Now If I could have some of your time on these laws, I would appreciate it.
 
* HB-1029
I have contacted the FWC, DEP and a few officers for both parties and asked them how this law really works. FWC says this : state parks and state forests- ask DEP - thats there department, so thats what I did. I contacted DEP on Monday August 28 at about 1:00 pm central time, after asking each person about the new HB-1029 (about 4 people) none of them new what I was talking about.
They told me that there was no new law that aloud fire arms in state parks or forests. I tryed to read to them the law that was printed at the NRA website and he said it didn't matter what the NRA web site said - there was no new law. This really bugged me because this law was mentioned in my sons " Hunter Education Course " over the weekend.
Can you please help me with this matter.I just want to know if I can bring my shotgun with me while I go camping at " 3 rivers state camp ground " during duck season.

Importance:	High

  

Dear Governor Bush and the Florida Property Tax Reform Committee,

 

How do 2 families on the same street have a difference in their real estate tax burden of $8-10,000 dollars?  In our neighborhood, the same house on the same street has a $64,000 difference in assessed value.  One house that is homesteaded pays $3,700 on an assessed value of $733,000 and the other house that just got homesteaded as of 1/1/06 pays $12,000 on a LOWER assessed value of $669,000.  Just because “they got their first”, the new homeowners are carrying the burden for these taxpayers.  This is an UN-EQUAL YOKE that is in need of IMMEDIATE REPAIR.

 

Welcome to the Save Our Homes homestead exemption.  A joy for one family and a nightmare for the other.  It is time to awake from your slumber that the Florida Tax Payer will just be quiet, pay their taxes and not mention the gross inequities and discrimination in the Florida Tax Structure which divides the voters.

 

People are losing their homes.  Mortgage payments are going up because of the escalation in assessed property values and 60-80% increases in home owners insurance.  These people are literally trapped in their homes waiting for the Sherriff to come and take it.  They cannot sell their homes because of the marketplace today with values dropping and taxes increasing.  Who can afford to pay an extra $600-$1,000.00 per month on top of a $1,500.00 mortgage payment for taxes and insurance and who the heck will buy that house with those high taxes?  NO ONE!

 

The Save Our Homes homestead exemption, authored by Ken Wilkinson, has only done catastrophic damage to the new home owners and voters across the State of Florida.  And what about the proposal for the “Portability” of the SOH?  This will only exacerbate the problem because it will prevent those who have NOT PAID THEIR FAIR SHARE, TO CONTINUE TO NOT PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE.  The homesteaders will only have an unequal tax burden and the yoke will be carried by the new home owners.  Once again, a joy for one family and a nightmare for the other.

 

The only fair solution to this disparaging, unfair, discriminatory imbalance of the real estate tax burden is to eliminate entirely the SOH homestead exemption that caps residents at 3% when assessments skyrocket.  Nice for them, but catastrophic for all other homeowners.  This solution is the only FAIR solution returning us to taxation with EQUAL REPRESENTATION.  

 

If the unequal tax burden is not resolved in Florida, new Florida home owners will simply find a new home state where home owners/voters are taxed equally and not discriminated against based on how long they have lived there.

 

Thank you.

Dear governor Bush,
3 years ago my house(of 23 Years) burned down (the local fire  
department never
showed up) I was under insured and decided to rebuild myself I used
all the insurance $200,000+$100,000 for contents .
After the lot was cleared my taxes went up- the tax collector gave
some lame excuse like they had to do it because of land use and
development or something like that,so I was paying more for a vacant
lot than when it had a house on it. I kept paying the taxes which
included homestead exemption and save our homes cap .
it is impossible to rebuild a house at the original cost .
The law forced me to build up because of the flood zone ,they also
say the space below the house cant be used for anything but storage-
this alone increased the square footage by 1700sq.ft..
so my problem is I just got my tax notice and it has gone from $1800
to $7000 which I cant afford to pay During all this I have developed
a terminal cancer . I am getting some disability and cant work much
because of the physical and mental problems the disease and drugs
cause .I know the simple answer is sell it ,but I have lived here
since 1983 I wanted my wife and kids to have the home and even if I
move the taxes on a different house will be grater because I wont
have a save our homes cap . Loosing a home because of a disaster is a
problem all over the state and the tax collector said the law has  
been changed to help hurricane victims but not me . I have lost  
everything and will lose every thing again because I have not been  
included in the updated law.
Can you help me?

Subject: Jeb Bush politically tilted educational program has failed.


Dear Tony Jennings,

The Ledger our local newspaper is making its readers aware that Florida
Students are LAST on Reading Test. As you know High Schools Seniors in
Polk County have been setting a FCAT failure record? Jeb Bush gave full
control of their educational system to parents, teachers and the elected
school board members. It has and still is costing tax payers millions of
dollars. Mr. Jeb Bush and is now washing his hands.

What is the Florida Legislature going to do about Governor Jeb Bush
failed educational program?  

If citizens opinions are important in your decision making process
Florida Citizens should question Florida State Senators, Representatives,
County School Boards regarding our County State educational and justice
system. They should dissect misuse of rank in the “Florida Home Rule” and
the "Employment At-will State”. Those two laws can be misused
interactively by school board politicians and have been misused by the
Polk County school board. 

As you know the "Florida Home Rule" is a provision of the Florida
Constitution, it provides for local governance of schools without
management intervention from Tallahassee. It is an open door policy for
misuse of rank. 

Parents, under paid teacher, and taxpayers did not have any input on the
following matter: Polk County School Board hired a $180,000 a year
superintendent. A second superintendent has been hired, independently
from the first one, including two school board attorneys and a separate
school board, all on taxpayer expense. Both superintendents are in full
support of the “Florida Home Rule” the "Employment At-will State” as part
of the Jeb Bush educational system. 

In the "Employment At-will State“ our local politicians are misusing
minority status exploitation for political gain.

Twenty teachers and 7 paraprofessional of the Lake Wales Charter Schools
have been dismissed, no explanation given. Thank you for your service for
the 2004-2005 school year. According to an opinion poll by The Ledger 77%
of Lake Wales considers it a wrongful dismissal. If you are not in a 100%
agreement with the schools or Jeb Bush ideology the “Employment At-will
state” sword will be used to make your head role. 

High School Principle D’Angelo has been dismissed for questioning a
charter school rule. A local judge did follow the “Florida Home Rule” and
the "Employment At-will state” and agreed with the dismissal. 

I have been dismissed from teaching as a part-time electrical instructor
from Traviss Technical Center in Lakeland Florida, dismissed for not
donating to a private fund raising campaign. It has been conversely
called a dismissal for a DIFFERENCE OF OPINION by using the "Employment
At-will State”. My belongings have been put in the hallway for everybody
to see. The hard drive had been taken out of the school computer I used
with my prepared lessons to block me from starting the second semester. I
did get the message, however did hang-in because the school did not
follow due process. I worked out of the hallway for six month until I
received my official dismissal letter. During that time I became aware
that Electricity II of Thomas Kubala has been ignored for years. It has
been too difficult for 90% of the students because of the lack of basic
algebra and trigonometry. They have never been given the FCAT test before
starting the program. The class had a 50% dropout rate per semester with
3 or 4 students finalizing the course. 

For many years public school systems have been allowed to use pressure on
employees to their “look good” fundraising campaigns approved by
politicians for political gain. Professor Sam Al-Arian has been
channeling money in Fund-Raising “FOR TERROR” and we are all paying a
price including our Israeli friends. Private Fund Raising 
Campaigns should be outlawed and we should not be pressured to donate, it
is a danger to our society.

In the past I have been an excellent part-time electrical instructor at
Brevard Community College for many years. School board Attorney Deming
Cowles did make my wrongful dismissal a RACIAL ISSUE to derail my claim
because the political misuse of the “look good” campaign happened to be a
UNCF campaign. On August 17, 2005, The attorney wrote to me that the
school “can dismiss you for you’ re [sic] -ethnic background....“ No
explanation needed“. I want you to know that I have been donating my time
to train minorities and women to pass a mechanics test for years. We are
now meeting at the Winter Haven library and using their computers. 

I have been unable to receive a hearing by the Polk County School Board.
It is un-constitutional to be denied representation from SENATOR ANDERSON
or REPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BOWEN without given an explanation. Polk County
Commissioners are declining to investigate this matter, and Governor Jeb
Bush claims in writing that he is powerless to look into this issue
because of the “Florida Home Rule“.   

On May 5th, 2006, Florida Legislature gave final approval to House Bill
1123, the "Government Accountability Act.“  I am asking for an
explanation from the Florida Legislature because it is the “NO
EXPLANATION NEEDED“ that denies a person from his civil rights. 

Sincerely yours,

Gov. Bush, Sen. Atwater, Mayor Frankel:  Due to circumstances such as losing a roof during Wilma (which was the most frightening experience of my life); having to move to a new location and losing my husband suddenly, I find that I must depart the state to be with my family in South Carolina.  

The most disturbing news to me was my tax bill.  Because of the hurricane and having to move (my husband never even set foot in the house I am living in), I received a tax bill for a condo that I am no longer living in, but trying to sell, and was appalled at the tax rate.  I feel that I am being punished for moving out and changing my homestead to the new house.  To go from $1,700 to $5,100 is the
most horrendous thing that I have ever seen.....to triple my taxes, punishing me, for moving.  What kind of government is bieing run here?

You wonder why real estate is no longer selling?  Why ithe sales have gone down 44%?  I have spoken to more people that are in the same shoes that I am in and are being forced to leave Florida because they cannot afford the tax rates.  How can you do this?  Florida used to be such a wonderful place to live, but the govt. has absolutely destroyed this state.

Between the insurance costs (which the state is not helping us with), the taxes and the general cost of living (gas taxes are also outrageous), people will be leaving in droves.  And, the peole coming in from the north which is more expensive, are even saying they cannot afford to live in Florida.

It seems to me that punishing people - snowbirds, etc - for not having their houses homesteaded is
an outrageous thing to do.  I am on a fixed income and find living here just about impossible.

Thankfully I have a contract on the two homes (if they ever close), but I am writing this for the rest of the people who are being punished and abused by the horrific taxes and insurance being levied on the Florida resident..

Can't any of you do anything to help the situation?

With reference to 2006 Notice of Proposed Taxes etc……..
 
As snowbird property owners, we are very disturbed by the amount of increase to our property taxes.
 
At this rate of continuing increases, it will become prohibitive to spend 5 months in Florida.  At which point we would find it necessary to sell the property and perhaps suffer a loss.
 
Most snowbirds are senior citizens on fixed incomes who, when they are in Florida, stimulate the economy by purchasing entertainment, recreation, food, clothing, restaurants, etc.
 
Broward County seems to be “biting the hand which feeds them.”
 
May I suggest that the “powers that be” become more creative and equalize the increases amongst its property owners.
 
Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:	Different emergency

Dear Gov. Bush: I have voted for you twice, and I'm hoping that will 
gain me an audience with you here for few minutes. I'd like to clue you 
in on an emergency that has nothing to do with Earnesto.
I have been trying to sell my house in Boca Raton for seven months 
without any luck. Every day more houses around me go up for sale, and 
it's not merely a harsh correction in an over-inflated real estate 
market and the effects of higher interest rates and hurricanes.
Florida has some major problems. This was a reasonable state to live in 
not long ago. Now it is expensive and getting worse by the day. My 
homeowner's insurance has gone up around 60 percent this year, which 
means another $150 a month out of my pocket. There was a story in this 
morning's Sun-Sentinel about local governments jacking up property 
taxes again despite raking in record revenues. And FPL rates have 
soared as well.
For the first time in many years, many more people are looking to flee 
Florida than to come here. That means more and more people like me, 
your constituents, will be unable to sell our homes. That will manifest 
itself throughout the state's economy.
I have appreciated your leadership, and we need it now more than ever. 
We need you to step up in a big way to save this state from a serious 
recession by offering us relief from crazy insurance rates. We need you 
to help us by calling out greedy local governments whose tax rates have 
grown way out of control. We need to make Florida an attractive place 
to live again that will bring people here instead of drive them away.
Your legacy is at stake, and all your good work will be forgotten if 
you leave office with a hurting electorate and economy.
We need your help.

Sincerely,


George Maselli

Subject:	taxes for snowbirds

to whom it may concern
 
I think it is criminal what is being done to the snowbirds re tax increases
without any concern for the fact that we come to florida-spend money in
the state and have to pay the heavy tax increases on our property without
any level of percent as the permanent resident does- not only do they have
the homestead exemption- but also can only get a maximum tax increase
of 3%- where as the people like us- who greatly boost up your economy
have to get increases to the rate of 30% to 50%.  We are really getting
unfair tax assessments.  Why can't we also have a more realistic tax
percent increase that is a lot more reasonable that what is going on now.
This is the reason many homes are going on the market for sale and 
the values of our homes are going down - but the taxes for us non-residents
continue to go up without any limit.
 
the state of florida would be better off giving us non-residents a more
realistic tax increase to keep us there rather than have empty homes.
 
hoping that there will be something done about this, I remain,
 
yours truly,
Sonia Sirota

The main reason we moved to Florida was economics. Now between insane home insurance and ever increasing property taxes we could have stayed in N.Y. and been better off. What the hell happened to our state, it has gone from a dream into a nightmare! We broke our backs building a new home on a parcel of land we purchased, now the county of  Hernando reassesses the land 4 times more than we paid and  does the same to our home, guess what? We will have to sell our dream house we cannot afford to live in it. People are leaving Florida for these reasons. We are sick over the whole fiasco that has been allowed to happen here. As for Florida's future, I see the very rich and dirt poor inhabiting the state, the working and retired middle class will be out of here. Oh yeah, I forgot, you'll have the illegal aliens living in the houses we vacate.

In light of the recent re-curving of hurricane Ernesto over the Florida peninsula, is there ANYTHING being done on the state level to provide wind insurance to the hundreds of business and commercial property owners who are now facing this potentially catastrophic storm without coverage?

Dear Mr. Bush:
 
Just wanted to let you know that I just got my renewal notice from State Farm for my homerowner's insurance.  Wanted to let you know that State Farm raised my policy premiums by over 200%.  Last year I paid $1,702.00 and this year they want $3,431.75.  You have got to do something about this or all the homeowners on fixed incomes will have to sell and get out of the State of Florida.  Additionally, I live in Charlotte County.  My property taxes are going from $1,642.52 to $3,106.58.  As you can see it will cost almost $7,000.00 to own a modest home in Florida.  Now I don't know of anyone that gets these kinds of raises in one year.  We would be better off to go to a full state insurance funding program and tell all the insurance companies to get out Florida, we will take care of our own.  I know you are only one person, but people living in Florida on fixed incomes just cannot afford all these increases.  Gas prices up, FPL prices up, Water prices up, Food prices up, Telephone prices up. etc.  Where do you and your committees think all this money comes from.

My property has been appraised at $18,000 since I bought it.  That is almost exactly what I paid for it.  Last year, my property value almost doubled to $32,000.  I just received my statement and it now says my property is worth $237,000.  I can not believe Florida can say that my property has improved in value to that extent.  I would like someone to look into this for me.  I am a hard working person that has retired.  There is no way that I can afford to own a part of this great country and pay the taxes that Florida is requesting of me.

Dear Governor: I was shocked to find out that my property tax on my home doubled from last year.When I called up the Orange County Property Appraiser about the matter ,they told me since the home changed ownership last year , that it was normal procedure to reaseset at the higher value.And I was told that the property would not have been reassesed had my name also had been on the title.I feel that this action is unjust because my mother who was living at the time,had signed the home to me under the witness of notary public.I had taken that document to the Orange County courthouse to be recorded.And afterward,I had signed an afdavit stating that I had lived in that home since 1980.In addition to this when my mother could no longer take care of herself,I had her placed in a nursing home under Medicaid so that she could receive aid for nursing home care.My mother legally signed the property to me before she died.I feel that since I lived with my mother in the required period of time so that I could keep the home under the rules of Medicaid,then I should be extended survivorship rights to the property.When I say survivorship rights ,I am saying that when the ownership of a home is transfered from a mother or father,that the son or daughter should not have the house reassesed.They should pay property tax on the value that was assessed when their parents had it.Now if this is not possible ,then there ought to be a law that makes certain exceptions to titles of property that have to have two names on it in order for one of the parties to the property to enjoy survivorship.I feel that if a son or daughter who has been living with their mother or father for so many years and whose parents are receiving (or will be ) receiving Medicaid in a nursing home,that if the parent signs the property over to the son or daughter before the parent dies,then the son or daughter have survivorship to the property granted to them by the protective powers of the State.In essence ,the Department of Children and Family Services should be granted extra authority from the Florida Legislature to tell the Property Appraiser of any county in Florida that they shall not put a new assessment on the property of the parent who has died in a nursing home and was receiving or about to receive Medicaid for nursing home care.As long as the parent was Medicaid elligible,then their son or daughter should be entitled to survivorship benefits to their parents real property.Sincerely,Pedro A.

NOW THERE IS A TOTAL UPROAR IN BREVARD COUNTY WE ARE ALL FACING A SPECIAL FIRE ASSEMENT SUPPOSIDLY BASED ON SQUARE FOOTAGE, YET THOSE LIVING IN 3,000 SQ FT HOMES ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS SPECIAL ASSESMENT, WHICH BY THE WAY IS NOT A ONE TIME ASSEMENT IS A PERMANENT ASSEMENT.
DOES IT SEEM FAIR THAT SENIORS AND THOSE OF MODERATE INCOME ARE BEING HIT THE HARDEST WITH THIS?
WE HAVE ALL BEEN DECEIVED WITHIN THIS COUNTY , OUR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, HAS INCREASED 60% IN 2 YEARS , WHERE ARE THE DEVELOPERS FUNDS FOR THE INCREASED FIRE PROTECTION.
THIS IS OUTRIGHT FRAUD..
THERE NEEDS TO BE A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRACTICES AND DECEPTIVE TACTICS BEING FORCED AND I MEAN FORCED UPON A COMMUNITY OR SENIORS, AND DECENT MIDDLE CLASS WORKING PEOPLE.
WHY IS THIS ASSEMENT BROKEN DOWN BY RESIDENTIAL CODES? FOR INSTANCE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE IS PAYING ONE AMOUNT AND THOSE IN CONDOS ARE FACING HIRE RATES FOR THEY ARE ALSO BEING LEVIED A FIRE ASSEMENT ON THEIR DOCKS, PARKING SPACES AND GARAGES...LAST TIME I CHECKED THE CONDOMINUIM FEES COVERED COMMON AREA INSURANCE , THIS IS DOUBLE TAXATION..THIS IS UTTER FRAUD.
I WILL SEND A COPY OF THIS LETTER TO THE NY TIMES AND WHO EVER ELSE I HAVE TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THOSE. BREVARD COUNTY HAS LET THE DEVELOPERS IN, WITH NO PLANNING AND NOW IS ASSESSING THE COST UPON THOSE THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. 
THE NEXT COUNTY COMMISION MEETING OF BREVARD COUNTY COMMISIONERS REGARDING THIS IS 8/29/2006, DO NOT EXCEPT MANY RESIDENTS TO SHOW UP FOR THE POSTING OF THE LAST MEETINGS WAS A 3 LINE AD IN ORLANDO SENTINAL NOT THE LOCAL BREVARD PAPER.
THE SUNSHINE LAW AND SAVE OUR HOMES TAX SAVINGS LAWS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF FLORIDA ARE BEING OVERIDDEN AND ABUSED WITHIN THIS COUNTY.
THEY ARE HOLDING SENIORS HOSTAGE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO SELL AND THEY AND THEY CANT AFFORD TO MOVE..
SUNSHINE , YES WE ARE ALL SMILING IN BREVARD COUNTY, OR WE WILL BE IF SOMEONE IS LISTENING, AND BRINGS FORTH IMMEDIATELY, SOMEONE FROM THE STATE, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, OR ANYONE TO UP THE ANTE AND STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO ONLY WANT TO LIVE.

Dear Gov. Bush:

I am a native Floridan and am very upset with your
performance as govenor.  You have sat back and watched
our homeowners insurance and property taxes quadruple
and have done nothing about it.  As a first time home
buyer, I had to pay a very inflated price for my house
in April of 2005.  I just closed and I couldn't sell
my house for the purchase price.  Yet, my local
government will charge me property taxes based on a
very inflated price that does not stand up in the
current market.  Then, to my horror, I could not
secure a homeowner's policy with a major insurance
company.  Citizens wanted about 4 times what they
should recieve.  You HAVE to take action now even
though your term is almost over.  People will remember
you for this terrible crime of making living in
Florida unaffordable.  BE THE PERSON YOU NEED TO BE
and enact legislation restricting these terrible and
unfair increases or you will outprice living in
Florida as the wages have not increase more that 3% a
year, yet living here is 4 x what it was just three
years ago.  HELP CITIZENS OF FLORIDA!  

Sincerely,

Karen van Vonno, CPA, CFP, Disheartened Citizen

Subject:	low income housing

Governor Bush,

 

I need your help desperately. 

 

 

 I am a property owner in Bay County, Florida that rents to low income people through the Section 8 housing. By law, I am not allowed to raise their rent by more than 10% yet, my taxes have doubled and my insurance has more than doubled.

How can I possibly continue to rent to these folks and maintain the property?

I am already having a negative cash flow.

This is an impossible situation for property owners in this state. Investors are pulling out right and left. I will have to evict my tenants at the end of their lease term to get enough rent from people in order to maintain the property and pay the taxes and insurance. What is to become of the young unwed mother, I house no? What about the elderly lady who works as a maid at the La Quinta just to pay her share of the rent and utilities, or the couple with the handicap child. They are in need of housing too but I can not keep losing money.  This is going to happen all over the state if we do not roll back these taxes. You want affordable housing but it is impossible. 

 

I recommend some of the following be considered

 

1. Placing a cap on all properties just like homesteaded properties until time of sale 

2. Use a 5 YEAR MOVING AVERAGE TO ASSESS PROPERTY 

3. AN exemption similar to a homestead exemption for people who provide low income housing or there will be no housing for the low income and elderly.      

4. Long Term Rental property to be assessed differently than vacation homes or short term condo rentals as vacation housing.

 

I know that you are just trying to follow the letter of the law but the legislature needs to take a long hard look at the taxes Floridian are paying and do something about the insurance situation in Florida. We are running people out of Florida with the taxes and insurance. You thinking the real estate market is flooded now, hold on to your seat the ride is far from over. The real estate market is going to be come worse and worse as investors scramble to unload rentals that are no longer profitable due to taxes and insurance.

 

Alabama is only a little over 100 miles away from my Florida home and rentals and it is looking a lot better all the time.

Subject:	Recreational Treasure Hunting in Florida

Greetings Governor Bush,

 

In the gold rush days of California among the most successful were the merchants.  They sold the goods and services to the prospectors, making a fortune.

 

The current restrictions virtually banning treasure hunting in Florida are costing the State of Florida a fortune in lost revenue, money for both merchants and the state.  No sales = no taxes.

 

Treasures found are not treasures lost.  Treasures lost and never found do not serve anyone.

 

I can only imagine that the few millions of dollars the State of Florida collects when a large treasure is found is a mere pence when compared to the money spent by adventures looking for the treasure.

 

Because a private citizen discovers treasure does not mean the item is lost.  Often museums can pay a fair price to add the item to their collection.  The entrepreneur should be rewarded for his hard work.

 

What good are treasures never found?  

 

Please repeal FS 267.  Or amend it to read:

 

*	All state lands: underwater, upland, and lowland, be open to recreational artifact collection by any means, including scuba diving and metal detecting, unless buoyed, roped, and marked by the state archaeologist as off limits to artifact collection for the purpose of preserving a designated historical site. In no instance shall a buoyed, roped, or marked exclusion area be larger than 600 feet (200 yards) in any direction from a site's perimeter as measured from the center of the site (the intent of this provision is to preserve historic sites without infringing on the public right to the use of state lands). 
*	Anyone found collecting artifacts in any area buoyed, roped, or otherwise marked by the state as off limits to collection shall be in violation of FS 267
*	Any sight discovered by a private party, deemed to be of important significant Historical or Archeological find, may be immediately confiscated by the State of Florida for fair market value of the find.  This includes finds on both private and public lands.

This is a fair and reasonable revision.  Everyone wins, specially the State of Florida.

 

There are already laws and penalties to protect the environment and such should be upheld.  Nobody has the right to ruin or destroy the environment.

 

Thank you for considering my proposals.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	Taxes out of control in Bay County

Importance:	High

August 25, 2006

 

Governor Bush:

 

I want to bring to your attention a tax fiasco in Bay County that defies your stated priority to cut taxes to stimulate economic growth.  Property taxes are being increased in Bay County to such an extent that they will break the back of the local economy.  The TRIM notice I just received estimates my 2006 property tax bill will be a 203% INCREASE over the 2005 tax if the proposed budget is adopted and ONLY a 97% increase if no budget change is made.  Those of us in the small town of Mexico Beach have been uniquely hammered, having been assigned a 129.24% increase in taxable value in just one year—twice as high as the next highest unit in the County.  

 

In addition to being an egregious abuse of government, the planned property tax rates fail to take into account a number of critical factors:

 

*	The estimates do not reflect the current real estate market.  The formula includes property sales completed as of January 1, 2006.  Real estate sales in Mexico Beach, like the rest of the coast, have crashed since the time of Hurricane Katrina—few have wanted Gulf Coast real estate since then.
*	This tax hike will exaggerate the current glut of unsold property.  Because no one is buying real estate in Mexico Beach, we property owners are held captive by these taxes.  With this tax increase, we couldn’t find a buyer even if we wanted to flee.  
*	I am ineligible for the Homestead Exemption, but my property makes me a Bay County small-business owner, so the tax hike will likely drive out small-business owners, like me.  We are being unfairly burdened because taxes on property under the Homestead Exemption are capped at only CPI increases.
*	Because I bring in vacationers to my Bay County property, I have contributed to the economic engine that has led to the “very dynamic year” described in the full-color brochure that accompanied my TRIM notice.  This tax increase will drive this economic engine into the ground.
*	Vacationers who have come to Bay County in the past will surely take their vacation dollars to neighboring states when they see the rental prices that will be required to support these tax increases, so the taxes will drive away the very source of income that supports the Bay County economy.
*	Bay County--and Mexico Beach in particular--has just started to enjoy some stable years after the devastation of Hurricane Opal.  How outrageous to victimize again those who have worked so hard to rebuild after that devastation!

 

The Bay County property value roll has been increased by 47% in one year.  This tax increase defies understanding in a state where you have declared your intention to cut government spending.   Mr. Rick Barnett, the Bay County Property Appraiser, has stated that his hands are tied because the Florida legislature failed to pass any of the bills intended to reduce the burden on uncapped property owners.  About 90 Mexico Beach residents who met with Mr. Barnett this morning were told that a meeting with you and members of your Property Tax Reform Committee is being set up for next week.  I urge you to attend this meeting and hear from your concerned constituents.  I pray that you can act quickly to prevent an economic disaster for our small town.  The same long-term property owners who have helped to keep Mexico Beach such a Florida gem are being crushed.

 

Sincerely yours,

Governor Bush,
In 2005 I moved into a $600,000 home in Lakewood Ranch Bradenton,Fl. I just received my first year of full property taxes -- $19,500. This amount is more than 50% of my federal tax bill. It equates to a State tax rate of more than 15%.
Something desperately needs to be done, I'm sure anyone reading this would agree that tax is way out of line compared to living in any other state.
Florida is a great place to live, but the tax burden is terribly disproportionate. I understand the Nov. ballot reduces tax on seniors, but it will be a pittance compared to $19,500.

DEAR GOVERNOR BUSH, 

THE FOLLOWING IS A LETTER OR I SHOULD SAY A TAX PROTEST ABOUT THE ALMOST OVERNIGHT TAX ASSESSMENT OF BAY COUNTY FLORIDA  AND ESPECIALLY WHERE OUR HOUSE IS IN  MEXICO BEACH,  FLORIDA  THAT WE SENT TO BAY COUNTY TAXING AUTHORITIES.  ROBBERY  IS A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO 
THE LONG TIME HOME OWNERS IN MEXICO BEACH. 

SINCERELY 
DAVID AND CONNIE JOHNSON

I BOUGHT MY HOUSE AT 120 NORTH 38TH STREET, MEXICO BEACH FLORIDA IN 1991 WHILE STATIONED AT TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE. I RETIRED FROM THE AIR FORCE IN 1993,( DISABLED VETERAN).  SHORTLY AFTER MY RETIREMENT I LEARNED THAT MY DAD WAS TERMINALLY ILL.   MY WIFE STAYED IN FLORIDA , AND I WENT TO TENNESSEE TO HELP MY MOTHER CARE FOR MY TERMINALLY ILL DAD. I TOOK A JOB WITH THE STATE OF TENNESSEE AND LIVED WITH MY PARENTS.  MY FATHER PASSED AWAY IN 1996 LEAVING MY AILLING MOTHER ALONE, AND SINCE I HAD A JOB WITH THE STATE OF TENNESSEE MY WIFE AND I PURCHASED A HOME HERE IN 8-1997 AND SHE MOVED TO TENNESSEE THEN.   WE KEPT OUR HOUSE IN FLORIDA FOR OUR RETIREMENT HOME.  WE COME HOME AS OFTEN AS WE CAN.  
YOU THEN TOOK AWAY OUR HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  I DON’T BELIEVE THAT IS RIGHT OR FAIR .  WHILE IN THE MILITARY (GULF WAR VET)  I COULD LEAVE THE STATE WITH THE USAF AND STILL CLAIM HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION IF I WANTED; BUT SINCE I’M RETIRED YOUR TAX LAWS SAY I CANNOT TAKE A JOB IN ANOTHER STATE AND HAVE MY HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.  TENNESSEE HAS NO HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION OR TAX DISCOUNTS FOR OWNING A HOME HERE SO I’VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY I COULDN’T KEEP MY HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION IN FLORIDA.

I REACH AGE 62 NEXT YEAR AND COULD RETIRE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE AND MOVE BACK TO FLORIDA. 
WE PAYED OUR TAXES $2973, PROPERTY VALUE $163,551, ALTHOUGH QUITE HIGH BECAUSE WE KNEW WE WERE NOT ELIGILBLE FOR HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION ANY MORE.   THIS WEEK ALMOST OVERNITE YOUR OFFICE APPRAISED OUR HOUSE AT A VALUE OF $946,669, OWING $11,104 IN PROPERTY TAXES IF NO CHANGES ARE MADE,  AND  $17,092 IF BUDGET CHANGES ARE APPROVED.  THAT’S $925. A MONTH OR $1480. A MONTH IN TAXES (MORE THAN THE HOUSE PAYMENT HAS EVER BEEN).  WHEN I HOPEFULLY RETIRE NEXT YEAR I CAN NOT AFFORD THOSE TYPE OF TAXES ON A SMALL THREE BED ROOM HOUSE . WHAT HAS HAPPEN OVERNITE IS, YOU HAVE DASHED ME AND MY WIFES HOPES OF MOVING BACK TO OUR RETIREMENT HOME THAT WE HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR , FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. 
I UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPERS HAVE BUILT EXPENSIVE CONDOS(THAT NONE OF THE HOMEOWNERS WANTED TO START WITH AND FOUGHT AGAINST) AND DRIVEN THE PRICES OUT OF SITE IN MEXICO BEACH .  THAT SHOULD NOT  AFFECT PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD HOMES THERE FOR YEARS (HOMEOWNERS).  ALSO THESE EXSPENSIVE CONDOS , ARE NOT EVEN SELLING (SOME OF WHICH THE CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN STOPPED COMPLETELY ,DUE TO THEIR NOT SELLING.  HOME OWNERS HAVE PUT THEIR HOMES ON THE MARKET AND THE MARKET IS FLOODED.  I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN JOLTED BY THIS OVERNIGHT TAX CHANGE. DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE OR AM I FINALLY WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY " TAXED TO DEATH " AND DRIVEN FROM MY RETIRMENT HOME.

Importance:	High

Dear Honorable Governor Bush:

First of all, I wanted to thank you for the "My safe Florida Home" program
that you have implemented in our State.  My husband and I have applied and
are very anxious to make home improvements that will allow us to be safer
should a hurricane hit us again.

Also, I wrote congress a while back about the cost of living in Florida.  In
a nutshell, our household has a bare bones expense of $35,000 to operate,
not including food, transportation or the like.  As you are aware, incomes
have not kept pace with the increase of home ownership, and we are headed to
a very scary place for middle income families.

I just opened my Lee County Tax Trim notice, and my property taxes have
increased due to the newly assessed value of our home since our purchase
last year.  We left our families in Broward County because we could not
afford to pay $7,000/year in property taxes plus all the other expenses for
the same home we bought here in Cape Coral.  Due to our home assessed value
going up, our taxes went up from $1734.92 to $3890.68.  My husband and I
knew that it would go up and are working hard to afford it.  However, the
proposed budget is forecasting a possibility of our taxes going up to
$4763.89.

As an aside: almost half of our taxes are going toward the school district!
My husband and I do not have children and do no plan on having children.  We
are part of the new stream of individuals who opt not due to the uncertainty
in our world.  A big concern to me is not only our situation, but also the
retirees who also do not have children.  Why do the people with no children
have to carry such a high tax burden?  Also, what about lotto?  Isn't there
suppose to be a large some of money going to the schools from Florida's
lotto?  Shouldn't those who are not over burdening our population be
rewarded?

I am very proud to be an American and want to pay our fair share of expenses
to keep our country going, but with rising insurance costs and the thought
of property taxes going up almost $900 every year, I feel that we are headed
toward danger as many citizens are forced to sell their homes and move away
from families.  The homestead exemption that we receive does not help very
much in the big scheme of things.

Please help!

Yours in Good Faith,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
      My name is Jacob Lux and I recently purchased a new home for me and my family in Cooper City. I am a permanent and totally disabled veteran. I closed on my home Jan 03, 2006 and just found out i cannot claim my tax exemption because I closed 4 days to late. If this is truely the way the law reads changes should be made. Let me pay the tax for the three day period and give me my exemption for the rest of the year instead of me paying a full years taxes. Homeowners in this state are being taxed and insured out of their homes- something must be done soon.I have voted Republican for years and I hope to continue to do so but if our party continues to allow these taxes to continue to rise what's the differance between us and the democrats.

SUBJECT:       Consulting Project on Future Structure of the State University System

 

 

In order to help the Board of Governors orient the State University System for long-term growth and improvement, the Board of Governors Foundation has hired the Pappas Consulting Group to evaluate the current structure of the system and make recommendations for the future.

 

The Pappas Group emerged as the most capable and experienced firm for this project in a competitive negotiation process.  They have extensive experience consulting with other state systems, including the University of North Carolina System and the State University of New York.  Dr. Alceste Pappas, the group’s CEO and former head of KPMG Peat Marwick’s higher education consulting practice, will be directing the project.  She will be joined by Dr. Stephen Portch, Chancellor emeritus of Georgia’s university system, and backed up by experienced professional staff in their Connecticut offices.

 

Late next week, Dr. Pappas will be meeting with Board staff in Tallahassee.  University leadership teams will then be invited to meet with Dr. Pappas and Dr. Portch during one of three site visits to Florida—to Tallahassee, Tampa and Boca Raton—in late September and early October.  Depending on schedules, face-to-face or telephone interviews will also be scheduled with representatives of other key stakeholder groups, including the other education sectors, faculty and students.




 

Dr. Pappas will be presenting initial findings at the November 16 meeting of the Board of Governors, and making a final report at the January meeting.  Vice Chancellor Nancy McKee will be managing the project on the Board of Governors end and you are welcome to forward any questions, concerns or ideas to me or to Dr. McKee at Nancy.McKee@flbog.org.            

 

This project, funded through several generous contributions to the Foundation, provides a unique opportunity to think strategically about the educational legacy we leave to the next generation.  I know I can count on your thoughtful, creative participation and leadership as we take this critical step toward building the system that our citizens deserve.

Subject:	Double Whammy for condo owners in Clearwater: Board wastes $100,000 in frivolous lawsuit over not observable window!

Importance:	High

CCFJ, Inc. Dispatch -- Please Distribute Widely! 
August 25, 2006
 
Dear Governor Jeb Bush, Dear Legislators, Friends and Members,
 
The owners of the CARIBAY CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION, INC. in Clearwater not only have to deal with a big increase of the property insurance premium, they as well have to pay about $100,000 for legal fees wasted by the board in a frivolous lawsuit. Or wouldn't you consider a lawsuit frivolous, if the judge rendered a DIRECTED VERDICT without listening to the attorneys for the defendant? 
See comments, court documents and transcript at: http://www.ccfj.net/courtrulCaribay.html
 
The condo association attorney, James DeFurio, clearly failed to convince the judge that an owner violated the governing documents by replacing a window that is (judge's quote) "not observable"?
 
We see more and more of these useless lawsuits that -- no matter the outcome -- cost outrageous amounts of owners' money -- without making any common sense! Board members have to learn that there are lawsuits with merit -- that help the community -- and many without merit -- that just makes attorneys richer! Boards have to realize that attorneys always get paid -- Win or Lose! 
 
Why filing a lawsuit that makes no sense whatsoever? Just to make an attorney rich?
In this case the owner won -- rightfully so -- but we see many cases where this kind of lawsuit eats up family's savings -- and more!
 
We need safeguards that stop frivolous lawsuits before they escalate. Why do you think the specialized attorneys wanted to remove the provisions for mandatory mediation from FS 720 (See House Bill 391)?
To protect the welfare of the homeowners -- or just their income?
 
Have a great weekend!

Jan Bergemann, President

Dear Governor Bush,
Hello I hope all is well with your job. Sir the  reason I am writing is I need help and some answers.
I just recieved my proposed property taxes and I must say
I just don't understand, Sir I am a single mom on disability,
and i guess I will have to sell my home and become homeless, if you catch my drift.
How can you let my taxes go up from $1086.92 to $2328.66,
well it does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out $1241.71 more in 1 yr. 
Mr. Bush I must tell you I don't think you are doing your job so well if you allow this to happen.
If this does happen more and more homless people and famlies will be on the streets including me and my son......
Please Mr Bush, you said on T.V. You were going to look into this when a young woman approached you and she was holding her baby on her side. I pray to GOD your words are the truth sir, because as I see this to play out I will have to sell my home.
Please feel free to contact me in this matter.

Dear Barbara Leighty:
 
As you state Governor Bush is in receipt of your e-mail correspondence dated August 23, 2006.   He has forwarded your correspondence to me for response.  
The FFlorida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission's ruling in your case, is one  that you ruled on the day before the Commission met, yes I am dissatisfyed as the case is dismissed the day before you met.  And did not address the issue of St Johns River Water Management District's violation of essential requirements of law.  You have a right to appeal the Commission's decision, that is the same statement the District made and therefore contacted your Commission.  
 
Would you please give me a copy of the decision that was made Tuesday the day you met rather that the decision of Monday, the day before the FL&W Commission met.
 
The original Petition was:
PETITIONER’S request for review of the SJRWMD rules rendered in the Final Order of the Emergency Order 2005-51 dated January 10, 2004, In accordance with Chapter 373.119 (3), F.A.C., Administrative enforcement procedure orders;   “Any person to whom an emergency order is directed pursuant to subsection (2) shall comply therewith immediately, but on petition to the board shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible.  (Petitioners were not awarded evidentiary hearing)
 
Water is still flowing from our lakes and the water level is below the 21 foot NGVD level, therefore this issue is not MOOT and action must be taken to stop the flow of draining our lakes.
 
A GATE AT MID POINT MUST BE INSTALLED TO STOP THE FLOW.

RE: Final Order no. LW-06-001 
Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush: 
The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Committee met on Tuesday, August 15, 2006, however the Final Order of Dismissal was filed with the clerk on (Monday) 14th day of August, 2006, therefore this case was dismissed before the Committee met. Citizens are not receiving fair and just interpretation of ruling. 
The Notice of Rights that I received informed me that I can plea a Notice of Appeal to District Court with filing fees. As experienced previously, Case #2003-12027CIDL as the law is written "[a] judge cannot interpret any statutes or rule provisions within the Governing Boards regulatory jurisdiction." Therefore the case was referred back to the District, which is the same thing that I would experience if I appealed this case; this is Kangaroo Court [disregarding normal legal procedures]. Additionally, the District violated the law in the first place and thus the reason for citizens having filed this cause of action originally. 
The Florida legislature enacts rules governing the Water Management Districts, but the Executive Director of each District has final decision to interpret laws and rules under his jurisdiction. 
I gladly will file an appeal if you will waiver the filing fees as you are misappropriating taxpayer’s dollars and the case will be referred to the District that violated the law using your guidance to prevent justice to citizens and deny the U.S. Constitutions 14th Amendment of Equal Protection of the Law. 
May I please receive an explanation and get results for the illegal operation and get issues corrected, or is the public caught in your trap. 
I'm looking forward to an immediate reply. 
Sincerely, 
Barbara Ash

Governor Bush,
My wife has been in tears for a week, since we got our property tax 
bill!  We have been working our whole lives to the goal of retiring to 
Florida, you beautiful state.  We purchased our retirement property 2 
years ago, but cannot yet afford to retire.  We are now looking at 
selling our beautiful home.  We will never be able to afford the 
property taxes.  I feel our property has been stolen from us, for no 
good cause.  Property taxes and health insurance...two VERY SICK issues 
confronting this country.  We are just sick about this. If this were a 
case of 'in it for the profit' where we were flipping properties, that 
would be one thing, but this is hurting people trying to work toward 
their futures.  And what possibly could the counties and municipalities 
be doing with all this money?  A fifty percent increase this year? 
twenty percent last year? My gosh...I am living on 2% raises.  This 
takes our breath away!  I beg you please, fix this problem.  I fear it 
is too late for us.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, Dear Legislators, Friends and Members,
After reading the report of the meeting of the Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee in Orlando I wasn't sure if I read correctly. But after reading the same statements in different newspapers I was finally convinced that there was nothing wrong with my reading, but there is something seriously wrong with the ideas of certain people who are getting greedier by the day.
We all know the saying: HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF!
I was born in a city that prides itself that it was part of a group of cities in Europe that created the first insurance for merchant ship owners -- called the HANSE. These cities created an insurance pool that insured merchants against storms -- and PIRATES!
The question Florida's owners have to ask: Who are the PIRATES here? The Insurance Companies?
After reading through lots of proposals and suggestions I think one thing is pretty clear: No more Cherry Picking!
We owners just can't afford that the big insurance companies take off with the big profits from the "good" risks and leave us owners with holding the bag, meaning outrageous insurance premiums that will drive many families out of their homes. 
We owners plainly can't compromise any longer  -- we are fighting for our financial survival. And if the insurance companies can't come up with feasible solutions, we, the citizens, have to take the initiative, under the leadership of our elected officials, to create our own insurance -- as did the cities in Europe in the middle ages.
We just can't afford "NICE" any more!

My wife and I are snow birds that enjoy Florida very much.  Our home is in rural New Jersey which we also love.
 
I think you're a fair minded person and so let me ask you about the fairness of the Florida tax structure that penalizes people like us.  We are not homesteaders for a variety of reasons, however, we don't believe it is fair to have us bear a disproportionate share of the Florida tax burden.  
 
Obviously, we have no representation in the electoral or legislative process, except to vote with our feet.  People like us will think twice about moving to Florida or for that matter staying in Florida.  Many will find it necessary to move to more tax friendly states where snow birds are welcomed and not penalized by making us subsidize the taxes of Florida residents.  The numbers of unoccupied homes and apartments will continue to grow if this issue is not addressed.
 
The marketplace will be the ultimate leveler in the long run, but this is also a matter of fairness.   I think achieving the goal of tax fairness in the short run will make it possible for Florida to flourish in the years ahead.  I urge you to take a leadership position on this matter. 
 
Many thanks for your consideration,

Please call a special session to get this mess straightened out - any 
company that offers any type of ins other than health/life in FL should 
be required to offer homeowners - at reasonable rates.

The answer is NOT to gouge the consumers - I understand that the 
reinsurer's indicated that FL homeowners aren't paying enough - I've 
been paying for over 15 years and have never had a claim and now they 
want to double/triple rates?

It's about time that the govt in Tallahassee starts standing up for the 
constituents which they have not done so far - Citizens is a disaster 
that is badly mismanaged, corrupt and the State govt has the 
responsibility.  Why can't you represent us?

You should be pressuring the Federal Govt to set up programs similar to 
flood insurance - & not just for Florida either - you should be working 
closely with other States that have suffered major weather disruptions 
so that a Federal program can be offered.

Please respond.

Dear Govenor,
I undertsand that the Bay County Commisioners and our Property Appraiser with be coming to Tallahassee next week to meet with you concerning Bay Counties property appraisals.  It is a huge hardship and I am hoping we can get some relief.

The law as I understand it requires that the value as of Jan 1st be listed as the "just value" thus the assessed value.  Problem in Bay county is that in early 2005 we had a spike in value that defied logic it was so high then the market tank the rest of the year so that by Jan 1st there was no way that you could sell your property fro anywhere near what the Property Appraiser is saying property is worth.

Patricia and I own a condo with my parents that we bought for $140K 4 years ago.  Last year in the March-April time frame we had three units (out of 126) sell in the $360K range.  I'm not sure how they got that much for a 850 sq/ft, 24 year old condo.

Rick Barnett has put our assessemnt at $299,900 for this year as of 1 Jan 2006.  Problem is that on Jan 1st we had at least one unit that had been listed on MLS at $267K for at least 2 months that had not sold and in fact still has not sold as of today.  In the meantime we have had two sales at $218K and $218.5K and eight other units listed for below $250K

How the value can be put at $299,900 when there was an identical unit on the market at the same time for $267K and 2 units have sold since then for $218K defies my logic.

Dear Governor Bush 

 

I recently received the property taxes for our second home which is located in Apalachicola. My husband and I purchased the 1893 Victorian house in 1997 and have been gradually restoring it with meticulous care to detail. The house was to be our retirement home. Alas, this is not to be.  We recently received our property taxes. This year, the assessed value doubled. In such as Naples, this would not come as a surprise, but in Franklin County? I was stunned. I spoke with the Franklin County property appraiser – Doris Pendleton. She said we had done a lot of work to the house. (In addition to making it safe and insurable by adding a new roof, and new wiring, we added a fresh coat of paint, more space for the kitchen and a second bathroom.)  I replied that I did not think it morally fair to penalize people for restoring their own home - a historic house that is significantly valuable to the historic district. *When we began to restore our house most of the historic district was in a state of total disrepair. Caring people like us have made Apalachicola a “destination”; a place people want to visit – and perhaps one day live. And yet, now we are being chased out of town.

 

I researched the assessed value of other residencies, and what I found did not make sense. Basically, unless the property owner lives in Franklin county (or tells a little white lie - or is flat out deceitful), they have the Homestead exemption, thus they are protected by the Save Our Homes act. 

 

My next door neighbor’s historic home is on a bluff overlooking the bay. Their land extends across the street and into the marshes and into the bay. Their house which is on 2.25 lots was just assessed at 585K. Our house – behind theirs, in a sump, on 4.25 lots was assessed at $1,151,086. Yes, technically we have two additional lots, but our neighbor actually has more land along with a magnificent bay view! It would seem that the visual appeal of our house - provided by the fresh coat of paint and the new roof - came at a far greater expense than I could have ever imagined.    

 

Furthermore, during my research, I discovered that the other historic 1880’s home next door to us - that sold for 160K in 1996 - is being assessed at 102K. Odd, considering in 1997 we paid 375K for ours and it is now being assessed at well over $1,000,000.   I must conclude that there have been some faulty assessments, and that there are some greedy – and perhaps corrupt people who live in Franklin County. 

 

Not only is Franklin County forcing out the second home owners they are putting the opportunity to own a home out of locals reach (first time home owners, especially).  Unless there is a reversal of this greed – prior to the tax increase - I, along with many others will be forced to sell - and invest in States where this is NOT happening.

Dear Governor Bush
 
I have been a citizen of Florida for all but one of my 52 years.  I am a registered nurse and for the 1st time in my life, I, like many of my friends and neighbors, am considering moving permanently out of state.   I live in a lovely home, in a beautiful community - Weston.  But because property taxes have increased so dramatically - more than double just this year, I no longer feel it is beneficial for me to stay.  I have never filed a claim with my insurance company yet the rates continue to rise.  As the highest paid representative in the state, I would like to know what action you are taking to correct this tremendous problem.
 
I await your reply

Subject:	Homestead Exemption

Dear Governer Bush: 
 
 We understand that you have put together a committe to review the Homestead Tax Exemption.  We also understand the HJR 353 will become effective January 1, 2007 which will increase the Homestead Exemption to $50,000.  This exemption would be a step in the right direction if the tax burden was distributed equally by ALL RESIDENTS.  A great disparity exists between new homeowners (both resales and new construction) and existing neighbors with like homes and lots.  For instance, in Cape Coral (Lee County) our house is assessed at $599,000 and our taxes will be $10,300.00.  Our neighbor is assessed at $591,160 and his taxes will be $5,623.00.  A difference of $4,677.00.  We all get the same services.  Does this seem fair?  
 
We would like to propose the following idea:  ALL Homestead/SOH residents will be given a 25% exemption on their ASSESSED VALUE not their SOH assessed value.  This way, the scenerio above, would produce the following:  We would pay $8,086 in taxes and our neighbor would pay $7,480.00.  Total taxes collected would be $15,403.00 under the current plan and $15,467.00 under our proposed plan.  
 
This plan would allow new growth into the area and still allow for the $3% SOH for Homesteaded Residents.  It will also allow existing residents to downsize and move around the state without incurring a huge real estate tax burden.  
 
We would appreciate you taking this proposal into consideration and passing it along to your committee members.
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am a snowbird living part of the year in Deerfield Beach in Broward County. My property taxes have been raised so ridiculously high in the past few years that I feel you must do something for snowbirds like me. Let me just give you a comparison between the taxes on my house in New York  State,one of the highest taxing states in the union, and the taxes on my Florida condo. My house is a split level in Suffolk County,Long Island, in the town of Huntington. I have over ¾ acre of property, a built in pool,a 14 by 22 foot deck,a 2-1/2 car garage, three bedrooms,and a long list of nice amenities. My house is worth between 650 and 700 thousand dollars.The taxes? About $8,400. My one bedroom,900 square foot condo in Deerfield is now taxed at well over four thousand dollars! The county estimates its value at a little over two hundred thousand. Please do some simple math. As you can plainly see,my Florida property taxes,as a percentage of the value of the condo,are at least 50% higher than my property taxes in New York. I get no tax breaks in NY. I’m not veteran or old enough for senior citizen exemptions. 

 

 Clearly,something is seriously wrong. I am urging you and the Florida legislature to get together and make some kind of law to address this growing inequity between part time and full time residents.

Please Mr Bush I'm begging you to do something with property taxes in Florida. This situation is chaotic. What regular American can afford the American dream of owning their own house, Property prices are ridiculous (for old houses) and add now $10,0000.00 to $14,000.00 in taxes for these same old houses, now add over $2,000.00 in homeowners insurance. Tell me who can afford that?. Another problem, This new "SAVE OUR HOMES PORTABILITY AMENDMENT" this is unfair to new homeowners. Everyone should pay taxes equally. (except the disabled and seniors). Please Mr Bush reform all these tax laws in Florida .

Governor Bush,
     My name is Gary Harris and I live at 17838 Mission Oak Dr., Lithia, Fl.  I have a wife and an eight year old daughter.  I am a registered Republican and have voted in every election since 1986.  I am writing you in reference to property taxes in Florida, especially Hillsborough County where I live.
     My wife and I earn about ninety-thousand dollars a year.  My wife works in an office and I am a law enforcement officer.  My wife and I saved our money for fifteen years to be able to afford our dream home.  Three years ago we bought a vacant lot in our neighborhood.  My wife and I built our home ourselves.  We pulled all of the permits and subcontracted the work.  I spent many hours away from my law enforcement job to complete the home, but we built the home for less than it would have cost for a builder to build it.  Finally we finished the house in March 2005 and moved in.  
      I just received my Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Trim Notice and learned that I owe Hillsborough County $10,086.80 in property taxes for the 2005 year.  I don't know how anyone could look at that number and not find it offensive.  I can afford my house just fine.  I cannot afford this outrageous tax.  I believe I am being taxed with no representation.  Hillsborough County Commissioners no longer represent the people of Hillsborough County, they represent the government.  Property taxes of surrounding counties are not as high as Hillsborough County.
     In order to pay this year's taxes I will have to refinance my house and pull out equity that I worked very hard to build.  But, obviously I cannot continue to refinance my house every year.  Next year I will be forced to sell my house or lose it to taxes.  I do not know if it will sell in this declining housing market.  But more importantly, I do not want to sell my house.  I built this house for my family to live in.  I built this house to raise my daughter in.  
     I do not believe the founders of this country designed it so that the government would be able to tax us into poverty, yet that is what has evolved.  I am writing this letter requesting the Governors Office step in and provide immediate relief for my family.  I am asking the Governor to force Hillsborough County to lower my property tax to a reasonable amount of money.
     Thank you for your time and feel free to contact me anytime to discuss this matter.

I think there should be something done because taxes keep increasing but not salaries.

Mr. Bush,
 
First let me say that I’m sure being governor, or any other elected official of the state is not an easy job. You are pulled in many directions, by many groups, and must also react to the many issues facing the state. My concern is just that react. It seems elected officials are not being proactive at all in regards to the insurance and tax issues facing the state. What words of encouragement can you give me in regards to these issues, and what the state is doing to make it possible for residents and business’s to survive in the state. I know we had many major storms over the last few years, but what is done is done. What I want to know is what ray of hope you can give both residents and business owners in regards to the insurance and tax issues which are draining every bit of life out of us.

my then when I do its takes one month before they send him a notice of past due,
then another 30 days to respond, then if they dont respond they get another 30 days,
then the final notice that takes another 30 days so that is 4 months before they
even take action. mean while they are skipping town doing what they want and when
they get that final notice they get a job for a few months agian. how far is it 
for the mother or fathers who try there hardest and the dead beats get off so easie?

Dear Governor Bush
 
We moved in our house April 2005 and just received out first full proposed tax bill of $6800  for a 2100 sq ft house on a 80 X 125 lot on a canal.  We do have a boat but can only use it during high tide because of the water depth in the canal.  
 
The taxes on this lot were around $425 when we purchased it in 2001 and last year our tax bill was $2600 and the only improvement was a seawall.   When we signed with the builder we calculated our taxes to be around $3500 after completion of the house.  Even that was high but we wanted this to be our retirement home.  
 
This tax bill has us totally in shock.  Needless to say it appears that our time in this home will be only 2 years and we will be forced to sell.  This was supposed to be a retirement home but with expenses like this we will never be able to fully retire not to mention they are planning to repave the development in a couple years that will add a large assessment for 10 or 20 years or so we are being told.  
 
You have done a excellent job in Florida and I appreciate the tax relief you provided me but Charlotte county has taken that hundred times over.  I can't imagine what they are doing with the additional money they are collecting vs 4 years ago.  I guess they are trying to make Charlotte county a world of rich folks and unfortunately that doesn't include us but the county commissioners just don't seem to care.

Subject:	Can you help me with my property taxes

Dear Jeb,
Yesterday I received a notice of a substantial increase in my property tax for my home in Ruskin, Florida (Hillsborough County).  My real estate taxes increased from $1,299.54 in 2005 to $5,863.20 in 2006 because I lost my homestead exemption and the market values increased considerably since we bought it in 1994. I moved to North Carolina in August of 2003 because my husband passed way in December 2002 and it was very difficult for me emotionally to be here in the house without him. I moved back in May of this year and missed the January filing deadline.  The condition of my home was deplorable and I had to have many things repaired before I moved back ( I also have custody of my 3 year old grandson).  I thought that when you lost your exemption, it meant the $25,500 figure listed under exemptions on your tax bill that is deducted from your assessed value. I was not aware of the fact that you would also be taxed on the current market value of your home and not what you originally paid for it which is how it has always been.
 
I had a tenant/caretaker stay in my house while I was away supposedly to take care of it at a very small rent amount so I could keep it insured while I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life and decide if I should sell this house.  So now my payments are going to increase from $640 per month to over $2,000 per month because I wasn't smart enough to have read the Florida constitution.  
 
Had I been aware of the consequences I would have stayed in my house and probably taken antidepressants and had extensive counseling to cope with my devastating loss.  
 
Everyone I have talked to also doesn't know about the increased market value penalty (we are all college graduates).
 
For some reason I thought it was similar to the taxable gain provision that if you live in your house at least 2 years out of the last 5 there was no penalties involved.
 
I believe that this provision in our constitution regarding homestead  exemptions is extremely onerous and should instead be modeled similarly to the federal guidelines for taxable gains giving the homeowner a period of time they can be away from their primary residence without destroying their american dream through severe tax consequences.
 
In today's world family members are scattered about the country and one may have the need to live somewhere else for a year or two due to an unfortunate life event like perhaps taking care of their elderly parents or living close to a hospital to be with their sick child, or choosing between a job too far away to commute or of being unemployed. One shouldn't have to lose their hard earned equity too.
 
The good news is that I missed all of those hurricanes and the worst part of my grief process is over but now I am forced to sell my home in a housing bust economy because I cannot afford the increased payment amount.  The Hillsborough County tax assessor's notified me of the potential exemption loss in November of 2005 when I called them about a notice they had sent. I explained that I couldn't move back by January 1 but they did not explain to me about the higher market value part of the exemption. I could have lived in a tent in the back yard. I am real sure I am not the only one to make that mistake.
 
Please try to help me but if you can't is it possible that you could require that the counties provide some kind of warning on tax bills/notices containing homestead exemptions that taxes would increase substantially if the exemption was lost and provide some detail that in addition to actual loss of the exemption amount, what could happen to the market value and actual tax amount with an example.  Maybe someone else can benefit from my stupidity.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
 
Sincerely,
Susan Burk

Subject:	 Property assesssments and taxes

 

For some years now, as a result of Florida State legislation, owners of
"seasonal" property in Florida have been unjustly treated in the area of
property taxation. Where "homesteaders" have seen their taxes increase by a
maximum of 3%, many of us "Snowbirds" have been subjected to significant
double-digit increases.

The situation where I live in the wintertime, Century Village East,
Deerfield Beach, has peaked with the latest notice of proposed property
taxes from Ms. Lori Parrish, the County Appraiser.

In my specific case, the assessed market value has increased by 60% (the
valuation as at January 1, 2006, after the major hurricanes), and it may
well be that this is a real market value. I do not know as I am not
"testing" the market by putting my condo up for sale. In any case, more than
550 of the 8800 units in our "village" have been on the market for some
nonths with no buyers.

But if that is the "real" value, if you apply the tax rates as indicated by
Ms. Parrish, my property tax will go up by 53%....that is an outrageous tax
increase if ever there was one.

No one can tell me that Broward County and Deerfield Municipal services
increased in cost by anywhere near the proposed increase in my tax; the
proof of that is in the Deerfield Fire assessment which is going up only by
6%.

It is well and good for the city and County to hold public hearings next
month, but you must also realize that for many Snowbirds who will not be in
Florida until November cannot afford to try and attend the hearings; in many
cases, the costs would outweigh potential gains as a return flight and
living expenses for a couple of days could reach a thousand dollars.

If the State of Florida does not want to scare away investors and tourists,
who come and spend billions of dollars in your economy each year, you must
ensure that the proposed tax increases are withdrawn, or at the very least,
capped to not more than the cost of living.

If the budgets for the coming year are so inflated as to need more than a 50
per cent tax increase from "seasonal" property owners, as the expression
goes, there is something very wrong.

Anything more than single-digit increases in the current economic picture
can only give rise to forced sales, decreased values, and a drop in Snowbird
migration.

It is bad enough that we are captives of the property insurance companies
who have been authorized to obtain exorbitant increases in premiums. Surely
you elected representatives have the interest of the general public and can
show leadership in keeping a lid on taxes.

I would appreciate hearing your positions on this matter at your earliest
convenience.

As a snowbird, I & many of my snowbird neighbors, are shocked & angry that the assessment on our winter residence increased by 25% in 1 year.
I appreciate that the assessment is based on market values, & I don't doubt that a few units might have sold a that high price, but those sales were probably to speculators, whose only interest was to make a fast buck.
The rest of us, mostly long term owners, are left holding the bag, & if the mill rate is not reduced, many of us will have to sell our condos, & leave the Florida we love.
Please Governor, I appeal to you, help us in this time of desperate need.
Sincerely, Peter T. Patton, Senior Citizen (Age 77), and Veteran, 2017 Ashby C, Deerfield Beach, FL., 33442,

Subject:	A public policy that does not work

Dear Governor Bush:

I hope you or your staff more likely really take this message to heart.
Not because I am or am not a Florida voter, but because its going to
greatly damage the states economy due to public policy gone totally amiss.
I have a home in Volusia Country.  Better said a condo in Ponce Inlet, I
dearly love it there and fully expect to make that my majority if not full
home within a 5 year horizon.  I thought I was setting myself up very well.
I have unfortunately discovered that the tax policy in the state is well,
just crazy.  May have been good intentions but its become a train wreck.
Specifically due to SOH and capping the increases to SOH homeowners, the
full burden of run away county spending is being passed along to non SOH
homeowners, businesses and renters.  My proposed tax increase is 17% all
because of the spending increases and shift.  On a pure valuation basis
apples to apples it would be down year to year.  In the words of your own
county tax assessor its astronomical, unfair and bad public policy.  Does
this increase this year make my home unsustainable, probably not, but at
this rate it will.

Now it may be the view of politicians that I do not vote in Florida and
that is true.  But the renters and businesses do and those of us who are on
the receiving end of this bad public policy will vote, we will ultimately
vote with our feet.  Making property values drop even more rapidly than the
current cooling.  This will impact businesses, it will impact SOH
homeowners who have purchased in recent years perhaps even putting them
underwater in value.  It will add to the slowing in construction starts
depressing that workforce and tax base.  None of this can be a good thing.
And if you wait unitl its too late before addressing it, well it will just
be that too late and the damage will be done.

I can appreciate some reasonable attempts to protect SOH homeowners, but
this has gone way overboard.  For example, I do understand the homestead
exemption on property value, maybe 25k is not high enough but at least that
is a fair public policy.  This outright shift of all the burden is
literally unheard of anywhere else in the country.

I would appreciate the favor of your response and any real and near term
actions to address this.  I will be heart broken if I have to sell my home.
Sure I will make money on it, but I Iove it.  On the other hand, if this
continues year after year, I can not sit by and let run away property taxes
destroy my ability to live reaonsably.  I am certainly not alone in this
view.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I wanted to address a problem that effects most individuals living in the State of Florida.  The issue is with the property taxes we pay to our government.
 
I am a CPA and have heard many of my clients as well as friends say that they are stuck living in their homes because they wouldn't be able to pay the increased property taxes that would be associated with the purchase of a new house.  These individuals aren't concerned with the monthly mortgage payment or even the cost of additional insurance premiums.  The deal buster always comes back as the substantial increase in property taxes.
 
I had read an article issued by the Broward County Property Appraisers office stating that law makers were considering a bill that would let existing home owners take their assessed value of their current homestead to a new home.  I was disappointed that the State did not act on this relief.  A law of this nature would have benefited all Floridians.  This bill would not effect the purchase of real estate purchased for first time home buyers, investors or individuals looking to flip properties.  
 
Another form of potential relief would be to increase the amount of the homestead exemption.  The amount of $25,000 has not been increased for inflation.  As an example, I purchased my home 11 years ago.  I paid $172,000 for my 4 bed 2 1/2 bath home.  The homestead exemption of $25,000 represented an exclusion of taxation of 14.5%.  As per my last property tax bill my home has been assessed at $375,810.  The homestead exemption of $25,000 represents an exclusion of taxation of 6.6%.  This makes no sense.
 
The State has passed a number of tax relief statues over the years.  Some of these statues I agree with and some I disagree with.  To my knowledge there has been no relief for homeowners with the exception of our "save our homes".
 
I would highly urge you and your office to attempt to help solve this problem.  A number of proposals have been submitted along with various ideas on how to correct this problem.  Unfortunately as what happens in government, people listen but fail to act.
 
Thanks for your time in this matter.
 
Sincerely yours,

The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,
Dear Governor Bush,

We are part-time Florida residents who own property in your state. We 
just received our new assessments for 2006.  We have made no 
improvements to the house - in fact, it needs attention.
The assessed value is now at 780,200, up 131.2% from 357.500 in 2005. 
That is on top of a 34.8% increase from 2004, and a 12.36% uncrease in 
2003. Your law that capped at 3% the amount assessed value could be 
raised on homesteaded properties sure has done a dirty to the rest of 
us. You have created a separate class of property owner with no vote to 
be able to do anything about it.  In Wisconsin we have a uniformity 
clause in our constitution that at least requires all property owners to 
be treated the same.  Now, we can live with the 25, 000 homestead 
exemption for residents, but allowing all those increases to be absorbed 
by the non-resident owners is ridiculous.  Our taxes will more that 
double to over 9,000 just for this year alone.  Many of our 
acquaintances are cheating by claiming the homestead exemption when they 
are no more permanent than are we.  We chose not to cheat.  This is the 
thanks we get. We get to pay for all the services we don't use. We 
certainly don't send our children to your schools.  And if residents 
have 3%caps, what incentive is there to hold spending so long as it can 
be passed along to those who have no vote?  Do you no longer want 
non-Florida residents to own property in your state?
Please consider some fairness in this matter. Just because some people 
are willing to pay crazy prices for some properties,  don't force us to 
have to sell to them because they are the only ones who can afford this 
nonsense.  We bought our house in about 1994 for  about 215,000.  It 
needs maintenance.

Subject:	Disabled veterans real estate tax break

Honorable Govenor Jeb Bush;

I would just like to comment on the recent study to reduce or do away  
with the tax break for disabled veterans. I along with many veterans  
really are fast coming to the realization that our governments  
federal and state have betrayed us in some ways. Does anybody  
consider what will happen to the widows of these veterans when the  
spouse is gone if the tax break is eliminated. I also believe it is  
unfair to equate the disabled veteran to the disabled civilian for  
many reasons which should be obvious but it appears it is not. A  
civilian did not choose to put his life and limb on the line  
( compensation is paid to vets who served during wartime ).  
Civilian's also cost the state a lot of money for the services they  
require such as medicaid, the VA takes care of disabled veterans  
totally. The disabled veterans spend a lot of money in this state  
unlike many immigrants who mail their money some where else. There  
are many disabled people due to drug abuse, poor health due to being  
overweight, working under the table for illegitimate employers who  
had no benefits when they were injured. There are many reasons why no  
one should ever equate the service of a veteran to civilians when  
speaking about disability due to service. World War Two veterans  
earned about 28.00 per month that is 24x7, Korea was 72.00 per month  
24x7 what did civilians earn while their neighbors were gone. I truly  
believe that our governments our thinking that they are so powerful  
that they do not need the average soldier no longer but, they are  
wrong, one only need look around the world today to see that in the  
end the military has to go in and root the enemy out one by one  
unless you want to wipe out every living soul. Since Americans are  
slow to anger it will be sometime before the results of the attacks  
on veterans and the results of those actions become evident. If  
someone were to honestly poll the younger generation they would find  
out that they are not as anxious to join the military as the media  
would have us believe. Should the day ever come when a draft is  
needed I hope you have the borders secured because you might find  
your future troops escaping. Good Luck in all that you endeavor in  
the future and I thought that as governor you were very good but this  
most recent move I strongly disapprove of.

Subject:	[*] Special Session

Governor Bush:
 
''It's not in my nature to do nothing,'' regarding property insurance for the state of florida citizens, is your quote in today's newspaper.  But it is in your nature to do nothing regarding the 8% increase in FRS retirees insurance? and to approve the rate increase from $4.20 to $35.90 for our life insurance?  You also need to think about another challenge in your next 5 months in office regarding this insurance.  This in effect pertains to all State workers, because they will retire.  We give the state the best part of our lives, and the only thanks we get is outrageous increases in our insurance and hardly any retirement pension to speak of.  We can't afford to stay healthy due to the high cost of health insurance; now we cannot afford to die.  
 
Governor Bush, you need to think about all the retirees and state workers out there during your recently called "Special Session".  It would behoove you to repeal the 8% increase and the eight times over increase in the life insurance.  What are you thinking?  And what are all the legislators doing by also approving this.  Unfortunately, we cannot vote you out, but there are senators and representatives that can be.  Believe me, I will be out their campaigning for only the ones that are willing to help us;  and voting for those same people.  I have a lot of people of behind me in this endeavor, so you have not heard the last from us.

RE: Final Order no. LW-06-001 
Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush: 
The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Committee met on Tuesday, August 15, 2006, however the Final Order of Dismissal was filed with the clerk on (Monday) 14th day of August, 2006, therefore this case was dismissed before the Committee met. Citizens are not receiving fair and just interpretation of ruling. 
The Notice of Rights that I received informed me that I can plea a Notice of Appeal to District Court with filing fees. As experienced previously, Case #2003-12027CIDL as the law is written "[a] judge cannot interpret any statutes or rule provisions within the Governing Boards regulatory jurisdiction." Therefore the case was referred back to the District, which is the same thing that I would experience if I appealed this case; this is Kangaroo Court [disregarding normal legal procedures]. Additionally, the District violated the law in the first place and thus the reason for citizens having filed this cause of action originally. 
The Florida legislature enacts rules governing the Water Management Districts, but the Executive Director of each District has final decision to interpret laws and rules under his jurisdiction. 
I gladly will file an appeal if you will waiver the filing fees as you are misappropriating taxpayer’s dollars and the case will be referred to the District that violated the law using your guidance to prevent justice to citizens and deny the U.S. Constitutions 14th Amendment of Equal Protection of the Law. 
May I please receive an explanation and get results for the illegal operation and get issues corrected, or is the public caught in your trap. 
I'm looking forward to an immediate reply.

Subject:	Property taxes

Governor Bush,
 
  As a former Florida resident and a current homeowner in Volusia County, I am shocked at the sky rocketing property taxes I am facing.  I purchased a home in Daytona Beach in 2004 with the intent of retiring there after a career as an Air Force officer, and now I find I can no longer afford to maintain the home even though it is fully rented.  When I purchased the home in September of 2004, the tax bill was $2,844.00.  Soon after closing, the taxing authority assessed the new tax bill at $3569.00, a 26 percent increase.  In August of 2006, I received another notice of tax increase with the new bill at $4423.00, an increase of 24 percent over the year prior.  I haven't even owned the home for two full years and my cumulative tax increase has been 56 percent over the original tax bill in 2004.   How can anyone afford that type of tax increase in such a short time--what will the increase be next year? & nbsp; 
 With the Florida statute penalizing out of state owners to that degree I only have one choice in that I will sell this property and look elsewhere.  It is unconscionable that such a small group of unrepresented people are forced to pay such a disproportionate share of the tax load.  As written in the Volusia County Property Appraiser's newsletter dated August 2006, "SOH has created a situation where a majority of our property owners (with values increasing significantly) are paying less than 4% of the annual increases in property taxes from year to year and all others (non-capped) are paying 96%!"   How can I be expected to pay three to four times the amount my neighbors are paying in taxes for the exact same services?  How can I rent my home for market value when I am paying almost $300 dollars per month more in taxes than similar homes?   I can't, and frankly I shouldn't have to.&nbs p; How can it be in anyone's sense of fair play that non-capped owners pay 75% more for the exact same services?  Do out of state car buyers pay 75% more for vehicles?  How about non-capped gasoline prices or hotel room rates?
 This issue is so out of kilter that the Governor's Taxation and Budget Reform Commission had to finally address this massive "tax transferal problem", and what I want and feel entitled to is a refund on the outrageous increases in taxes I have paid over the past few years.  When the IRS or state tax authority finds someone "cheating them out of revenue" they recover the money and levy stiff fines--this should follow the same principle.  If that can't be done, why can't veterans be given homestead authority to apply the 3% cap?  I've contacted the Volusia County tax office several times inquiring about active military applying the homestead authority and was told that I needed to live in the state to be eligible.  How can I live in the state when I'm ordered to serve elsewhere?
 Please respond to this letter with a course of resolution and an explanation of where the property tax issue stands with the commission.  I am sending a copy of this letter to the local taxing authority in Volusia County and the to the state and federal representatives in the district.  I would really appreciate some help on this issue since everyone seems more than willing to pass the buck and stand behind a statue that leaves a significant number of people at an unfair disadvantage.  Thank you.

Subject:	Taxes and insurance

Gentleman I am writing all of you collectively about the tax and insurance crisis we as citizens of this state are facing. I was born and raised here and have family here as well. The property appreciation from the 1990s to the present has been tremendous. County tax appraisers have been steadily raising assessed values not to mention houses being bought and sold at new increased values has not been enough to stem the governments never ending appetite for more taxes. The insurance companies have collected our money for years and have shown profits every year until the present day even with the hurricanes! Government accountability and responsibility is out of control! You all are career politicians like most of your fellow colleagues, and are not living and working in the private sector. Your money and benefits come from the backs of the working people. My brother works for the VA and will soon retire. I have told him he is in for a rude awakening when he goes to work in the private sector. When you retire from office you all receive nice benefits and accumulated benefits from previous public service. I earn about 50 K a year as a printer with no benefits and can raise that amount if I don't want to see my children, but I choose to work less so I can see them a little. With taxes and insurance increasing at the present rate I will be forced to leave the state in search of less expensive state to live. I figure why should I be forced out of my home because of your greed and irresponsibility and no accountability. I would propose enacting a grass roots crusade to cut government pensions and perks for executive members in half for starters and there are a lot of other ways to help each of you feel our pain. I believe in electing accountable people to office to represent my interest, but when you are separated from reality as most of the elite are, it is time to bring your golden parachutes down to earth. My beef is the proposed increase in property taxes on rental property. $2000.00 per year on 87K assessed value up from $100 @ 75K and $4400.00 proposed increased on 187K assessed value up from $2800 @ 116K both in west Tampa which is not a rich area. Not to mention my house in St.Petersburg with present insurance @ $1300.00 with proposed increase of 50% for 07. Both properties in Tampa are with citizens, and they are sky rocketing! I am not an activist but I see the need to become one. I am disappointed with the present state of affairs and the condescending attitude that prevails in our government of the elite. I know you think my numbers are small and insignificant but I am in touch with many who are in the same way and they too want accountability for their tax dollars. Your doings and actions are known among the people and you will have to answer for the things you have received one day. I do not seek for power or fame but to be accountable to God for my actions. I hope you will take this letter serious and implement some action to stay the tide of ever increasing spending and perks and waste that is occurring in our state. You work for us please try to remember that!

Subject:	Enforcing the Florida Building Code in the panhandle.

Governor Bush. I just read your letter that you sent to the Florida Building Commission concerning the Wind Borne Debris Exemption for the Panhandle of Florida. Governor Bush you have been badly informed on the Building Code enforcement for the Panhandle. 1. There is only one Florida Building Code in Florida. We have the Florida Building Code for commercial construction and the Florida Residential Code for residential construction. The Inspection departments in the Panhandle enforce the same code as is enforced through out Florida to the letter!  If you are constructing in the 140 mile region you have to build a building to withstand 140 MPH wind speed. The same for the 130 and 120 wind speed region. There is only one small part of the code that is different in the Panhandle. In chapter 16 section 1609.2 Definitions, WIND-BORNE DEBRIS REGION, part 2. There are three lines that mention the exception for the Panhandle about the Wind Borne Debris line being one mile from the coast. Out of hundreds of pages in the Florida Building Code this is the only thing that is different than the rest of Florida! So the comments that you made in your letter about the Panhandle having a weaker Building Code than the rest of the state is untrue! This is the Propaganda that Your Insurance Commissioner and other Misinformed people have spread through out the state! I am the Building Official for Okaloosa County and all the Building Officials in the Panhandle and I all agree the Based on Historical and scientific data gathered the one mile from the coast worked very well during the past Hurricanes. I challenge you Governor Bush to have the insurance companies show you the claims made all over the state that was caused by wind-borne debris breaking a window and damaging a building. I think that you will find out it was very minor even in south Florida, WE FOUND NONE IN OKALOOSA COUNTY! During Ivan there was tremendous damage due to the storm surge in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties! As you moved one mile from the coast the damage dropped significantly. Governor Bush the Building departments were all but ignored in this study of the Panhandle exemption. WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT SEEN THE DAMAGE FIRST HAND! WE SEEN ALL THE DAMAGE! WE DID NOT PICK AND CHOUSE THE AREA TO SURVEY AS SOME GROUPS DID! We went to every Building that was damaged in our jurisdictions. When you ordered this study you wanted it based on scientific and historical data and take the politics out of the Building Code. But your letter says something different. Moving the panhandle exemption will not help the insurance crises in Florida. The Insurance Companies have been given a license to steal without a gun! People are going to lose their homes because of the increased cost in insurance. Do you know through out all the storms and the billions of dollars in claims that the insurance companies paid there stock holder’s dividends? I ask you how did they do that if they lost money? Thank you for your time. Harold W Owens CBO Okaloosa County.

I’m writing in hopes of finding some relief for a problem that has gotten out of control. My fiancé and I moved to Pinellas County in July 2002. We purchased a condo, earn about $60,000 annually between us, have worked hard and saved our money, and would now like to buy a small house. The problem is, between the increase in property values, and the related increases in property taxes and insurance, we can’t afford to even purchase a small 50-year old house in any part of the county expect perhaps the most run down areas there are. We could deal with one of those expenses going up astronomically, but not all three. We’re doing our part to make the American dream come true, and you’re allowing serious impediments to hardworking taxpayers price the middle class right out of the market. It’s un-American!
 
For example, we’ve been looking at very modest two and three-bedroom single-family houses, most built in the 1950’s and less than 1500 square feet, in South Pasadena (where we currently reside), Gulfport, Seminole, and Largo. I’d say the average price has been around $250,000.00, which is what we think our condo is worth. Problem is, we’ll go from paying $1400 in annual property taxes to an average of $4,000, and from $400 per year insurance, to about $2400 per year. That’s a whopping $533 per month just for taxes and insurance!!! This phenomenon has priced us completely out of the market, and we have three choices; stay where we are, go down in value to a dump house or a mobile home, or relocate to another county or state. I’m shocked and dismayed that our leaders would allow property taxes to get to that point. I’ve reads in the newspaper that government revenues have grown, yet I see no more services than I ever have, and you’re spending it nearly as fast as it’s going up! 
 
Please consider the following points:
*	Just because property prices (not values, just prices in reality) have risen, doesn’t mean the average taxpayer’s ability to pay them has.
*	Where do you get off thinking you’re entitled to spend my money instead of doing the right thing and keeping taxes in check?
*	Not only do we have to pay more for a home, now we get the triple whammy of dramatically higher mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance.
*	You should lower the taxes to offset the increase due to price increases.
*	Make the homestead exemption 50% of the cost of a home, not to exceed a certain ceiling, like a max of $250,000 exempt. When the homestead exemption started it was about half the price of a home, but it hasn’t kept pace with price increases, so now it’s an eighth instead of half.
*	Reduce the millage by the same rate that home prices increase to keep the tax base the same. Actual dollar amount increases should require a solid budgetary reason and vote.
*	 Reduce the millage rate on home purchases to offset the increase in prices, thereby resulting in the same, or slightly higher taxes than were paid by the seller.
*	If private insurance companies can’t make a profit in Florida with sensible rates, then perhaps the state should look at self-funding and running our own insurance, similar to FEMA flood insurance.
*	Look into passing law making it illegal for mortgage lender and underwriters to require hazard insurance.
*	$2400 annually for a normal homeowners policy on a 50-year old $236,000 concrete block house not in a flood zone is nothing short of outrageous.
 
As a war veteran and registered voter that has worked and paid taxes for the past 30 years, I’m telling you, my representative in the democracy I fought for and believe in, that we need help!!! Unless you’re blind, you’ve seen this happening and should never have let it get to this point, and now it’s your responsibility to do something about it. 
 
Sincerely,

The Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor of the State of Florida
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
    I have been fond of Florida since my first visit to Naples, Florida in 1961, as a youngster, to visit my grandparents who wintered there.  My mom currently lives in Leesburg where she moved to retire with my late father in 1984.  And, though I had been away from the state because of my duties in the Navy, I was a resident from 1985 to 2005.  I now live in Leawood Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, where my wife enjoys a fulfilling career with SPRINT.  (Her career is the only reason we are not in Florida – after following me around for the past 18 or so years, supporting her new career only seems fair.)
 
    In my travels during my Navy career I purchased a small piece of property in Panama City Beach.  We have visions of either living in the house we built there full time or have it be a vacation home in the near future (currently we have a renter in the house). 
 
    Recently I received my annual statement for expected property tax from Bay County.  It was quite unsettling to see that the property tax that was approximately $1700 in 2005 is now more than $3650.  I understand the need to properly assess homes to ensure fair and equitable taxes are paid in order to deliver valuable county services.  However, three things bother me regarding this property tax increase:
 

1.	There are people in Bay County who, for one reason or another, cannot take advantage of the homestead exemption protecting them, to some extent, from this large property tax.  The result will be middle income people being forced out of the community because they cannot afford to live there any longer.

    2.   Poor people who live in the county will be forced out of the community because of the resultant increase in rents that  
          will inevitably occur.  (Unfortunately I know this will also negatively impact the military personnel at the Coastal Systems 
          Station area; and could possibly impact decisions to continue to grow that facility.)
 

3.	The assessments (appraisals) conducted, in no way match what the property is worth, and this is a very important factor, nor has the property ever been as valuable as the current assessment suggests.

 
    If the third point is true, and I am certain that it is correct, the first two points will occur unnecessarily.  Sometimes people get “taxed out of a community” – I know this to be true.  I understand it, it is unfortunate, but I know it occurs and basically I have no problem with it when it occurs over time, as it usually does.  But to have it occur so quickly and to such a large degree is unprecedented.  It is important for you to know this will have only a minor impact on me, I am passing you this information because many of your constituents are to be seriously impacted by this situation.
 
    I know this is not really your problem, because technically it is a county issue. But, because I know what kind of person you are, I know this will concern you.  I also hope this is not the first information you have received about the choices the county commissioners are making in Bay County; it would be hard to believe I would be the first to bring this to your attention.  Nonetheless, if any “common-sense” can be introduced to the decision makers in Bay County many people will be in your debt.  
 
    I will send you a formal letter, as well as formal letters to each of the county commissioners, in the near future.  But I thought I would pass this note to you quickly via e-mail.  A large constituent of people in Bay County will greatly appreciated your involvement in this matter.
 
Very respectfully,
 
Stephen J. Kozloski

I have never written to you before, but we are MAD AND FED UP with this UNFAIR TAX SITUATION.
 
I would welcome a 'class action' suit, or whatever, to correct this TOTAL UNJUST TAX SITUATION.

Subject:	Will Another Cedar Key Family Be Forced To Sell Their Family Home Because of High Property Taxes???
Attachments:	08-22-~1 (2).JPG

Dear Jeb,
 
I am a fourth generation Florida native.  My parents lived in Cedar Key Florida.  My Dad was a Methodist minister and a Commercial Fisherman---until the infamous net ban amendment.
 
My parents have both passed away and they left me and my two sisters their modest family home. (see attached picture)  We feel so fortunate to be able to share this home with our children and help preserve a part of "Old Florida".
 
Unfortunately, our family will be forced to sell this home because of high property taxes. Each year since my father died in 1998 the property taxes have increased. This recent jump from $3819.26 in 2005 to "proposed taxes" of $5678.65  for this year will most likely force us to go the way of so many other Cedar Key natives and sell out to developers.  
 
When Florida passed the Save Our Homes legislation we feel that some sort of protection should have been included to assist families who just want to keep their family home.   We understand that the local government is responsible for these tax increases and we are aware of our right to protest the increases at public hearings.   Unfortunately many others have tried to do so but to no avail.  
 
A few years ago when I questioned the hefty tax increases I basically was told that the local government raises taxes "because the law allows us to".  
 
Jeb,  is there anything you can do to help us with this situation?
 
Sincerely,

Hi Governor Bush my name is Jane Van Etveldt  and I have a serious issue that I hope you can help me and my neighbors out with.  I’ve recently heard that you have a commission looking into the increase of insurance on communities; well my community has just informed us that we will be assessed $3,000.00 dollars for increased insurance and to cover repairs in the future.  There are I would say more than half the community that can’t afford this, and they want this done in a timely manor, we feel as if we’re being taken advantage of.  Our insurance is going up from $119,000.00 to $767,586.20 and the repairs assessment is for $270,877.00, which I don’t understand isn’t that what our insurance for??? I was hoping that you could take some time out of your busy day and help us out, this is crazy!!!! And because of this many hard working people will indefinitely lose our homes because of this. I would love to see a state audit take place immediately there has got to be something someone can do to reduce this crazy assessment.  Numbers you can reach me at are work M-F 8:30 to 5:00 954/360-0944 and my home 561/752-3023. PLEASE I’m IN A DESPERITE WAY and DON”T WANT TO LOSE MY HOME!!!!

Subject:	[*] homestead excemtion

Governor,
Please use your leadership abilities to make sense of this homestead exception debate. 
Let’s face it, we are all going to have to pay taxes. All we can hope for is that the taxes are equitable. I propose all homestead exception be eliminated, not increased. Under the present scheme of things a person with a $50,000 home pays 100% more taxes than a person with a $25,000 home; a person with a $75,000 home pays twice as a person with a $50,000 home. The people that really get the shaft is the renters, they don’t get any exemptions. Their rent reflects what the landlord has to pay in taxes, with no exemptions. The homestead exception is nothing but a political gimmick. Some of the lawmakers look at our temporary citizens (winter visitors) with real-estate as a good source of taxes, Lets face it winter visitors are an industry just as much as a factory. Rather than giving them a break, as we do other employers, we tax them more even though they use fewer services, such as schools. Another thing about winter visitors, in most cases they have no school age children, but they support schools big time. Eliminate the homestead exception not increase it.
 
Thanks for your service,

I have been a winter resident of Ft. Pierce, Florida since 1994 and returned despite not being able to live in my property after Frances. We suffered great loss of personal pproperty but were able to rebuild the inside but not to the former standard as the workers spoke no English and it was hard to communicate our concerns about quality of work. We also did not get all our insurance money.
 
I have just received my 2006 proposal of taxes and am shocked by the increase in my taxes.  I realize property values have gone up but I can no longer absorb the inequity in taxation that exists betwen residents and winter residents. I am paying close to three times as much as my neighbor with an identical unit in Ft. Pierce. The legislature called Save Our Homes is going to be responsible for the loss of our home there. Because we only live there for five months does not make it less a home. Basically, we winter residents have paid much more for infrastructure we only use part of the year amounting to our subsidizing the roads, schools, etc. for Floridians. 
 
My husband and I are retired working middle class people and the dream of winters in the south are becoming less viable.  Many "snowbirds" are slowly learning of this disparity and I predict sometime there will be a legal challenge to this unfair taxation. Family headed for retirement are opting instead for North Carolina where everyone pays the same regardless of residency.
 
Sure there is building going on at breakneck speed on the Treasure coast, ( St. Lucie West )but it has not been intelligent expansion.  The traffic is horrendous and there are not enough schools, teachers, fire stations or law enforcement members. The gated communities are ghettoes of a different kind with no sense of community. Add to this projected water shortages due to increased demands brought on by development and problems will multiply. People our age cannot afford Florida for much longer. We go to your churches, volunteer in schools and add to the economy. We have really enjoyed the friends made there and will always treasure our time in Florida, but can no longer afford it.
 
 Sincerely,
 a disenchanted winter resident from a small northern town

Every taxing authority in St. Johns County and Marion County for the last three years have increased their budgets in excess of 20%, averaging aournd 25%, per year.  Not only have their budgets increased substantially so has property values.  This year alone, I saw an increase of $40,000 on my Marion County home.  The citizens of Florida need property tax relief.  I would like to know if your office is going to look at this issue.

I most certainly understand how you feel.... and you have every right to feel that way.  I feel the same way. Just because I am the Tax collector does not mean I think the assessments and mileages are fair. (Sometimes I get Shocked)   However, you must contact the property appraiser.  That number is (850) 653-9236 as she is the only one that can help you with your assessed value.

My name is Sally Leach, My husband and I own The Key House at 15, 13th Street in Apalachicola. 
 
I am writing to say that we oppose the HUGE increase in the assessed property value as well as the increase in property taxes for 15, 13th St. When we purchased The Key house - in May 1998 - we paid $375,000. As to be expected, the property taxes steadily went up each year until last year when there was a very large spike. At the time I was stunned, but I thought that would be "it". However, this years proposed taxes have my head spinning. 
 
This year, The Key house has been assessed at 100% more that the amount it was assessed at last year. I ask, how can this be? It is truly bizarre. Traditionally, assessed values are lower than appraised values.  However, the new assessed amount for the Key House - the house we had hoped would be our retirement home - is actually higher than even it's current appraised value! (Based on an appraisal obtained by my bank just two months ago.) I have never heard of this happening before, and I am heart broken. 
 
Because The Key House is not our primary residence, we do not have the luxury locals have regarding protection from the assessed increase through the "Save Our Homes" exemption - which limits property tax increases to 3% or less. Hence my property taxes for next year will be either $14,054.98 or $18,227.91. 
 
Either option is TOO much. I cannot see how we can pay this much in property taxes next year, let alone after we retire.  Perhaps this is what Franklin County wants - to chase away those who planned ahead and purchased their little bit of heaven before they were actually ready to relocate?  
 
Personal feelings set aside, I really do believe the increase in taxes will chase away those wishing to settle in Apalachicola. Housing is already out of reach for most locals and is now becoming prohibitive for those wanting to move to Apalachicola - or invest in a second home. Considering the property insurance crisis that already destroyed a great deal of the real estate market I strongly suspect that this will be the last nail in the coffin for Apalachicola.  
 
Greed is a powerful thing.   
 
Sincerely, Sally Leach  (239.598.2589)
 
P.S. Below is a summary of the tax increases I have paid since purchasing the Key House. 
 
    1997: $ 4991.53
    1998: $ 6396.88
    1999: $ 6708.37
    2000: $ 6270.20
    2001: $ 5889.08

Dear Governor:
 
I have been a land owner in Bay County for over forty years for family vacation purposes; however, I now find myself no longer able to afford my own property because of the extremely high taxes and insurance. I may soon be forced to sell out and leave Florida to vacation in my own state or somewhere else.
 
Taxes have been practically tripling annually for the past few years (much faster than reasonable sales value) and insurance rates since the last hurricane season have become ridiculously high if you can find coverage or any agent who will answer the telephone. This year my insurance has jumped from the $400 - $500 range to the $2500 range and expected taxes have tripled again even though sales values have dropped precipitously.
 
I do not believe that those who do not live in Florida full-time should be forced to pay the bill for the local school systems and make up for the lack of state taxes on permanent Florida residents. I would not object, if Florida Residents were not getting a free ride.
Those of us who vacation in Florida, spend considerable funds on services when we are visiting but I do not feel that we should be obligated to support much of the state infrastructure that we do not use. There must be a reasonable soution somewhere in between.
 
I know that this is a complicated and politically difficult issue but if some relief is not in sight soon, I feel that you will be losing a lot of people who have helped to build your state over a long period of time and enjoy visiting there.

I have owned a condo in Fabulous Florida for over 15 years, but I am not a permanent resident of Florida, yet.  I was told that I cannot obtain a reduction on my property tax because my home of record is in Georgia.  
 
However, I was also told that I cannot obtain a Senior Citizen discount  on my property because I am not a permanent resident.  
 
Governor, I am 72 years old everywhere, but to refuse a Senior Discount on my property unless I am a permanent resident, is a bit overboard.  It is difficult enough to live on my retirement, but to say that I get no Senior Discount because I am not a permanent resident, is too much.
 
I hope you will give us Seniors a break and change this law.
 
Sincerely,
Mr. Ivey G. Crow

Subject:	[*] 300+% increase in Property Tax in Citrus County in One Year!!!

Dear Gov. Bush,
I have talked via phone to the Citrus Co. property people concerning my 84 year old mother's vacant property (Eleanor Stinson) on Soc. Sec. limited income  who has owned 20 acres on an unimproved dirt road for appx. 30 years who has no intention of selling. They have increased the value over 400% in just 3 years. She brought it to my attention today when she got her tax proposal... Just this year it is going up from last year's value of $79,2 to this year $243,600. This is un-American. This will force her to make a decision in not leaving the property to her great-grandchildren education. This is simply not right. She needs an advocate in your position to help us. speculators have driven up prices. Today, sales as i understand it have dropped off but they have driven up values which have not leveled off to a lower value, also, it is taking much longer now to sell property; it's all over the news. At minimum they should wait a few years to see new values after the boom. Please help us and I am sure there are more like us... Another point is Citrus Co. is asking not only for ridiculous assessed value but on top of that a 25% increase in their budget!?  
Vacant property should be treated more like homestead property, not changing the value till it sells to a new owner. It forces land owners to go to agriculture exemptions on small property trying to get around taxes.  
At last resort we will join with other property owners and take it to the media. Hopefully this has been brought to your attention by other property owners. 
 
Please help and call me Ralph Stinson, a fellow Republican  @ 813-948-6605 or my cell 813-732-3579.  property # AK1516170
 
Respectfully,

Dear Governor bush.

My question is concerning the comprehensive hurricane mitigation act. Is it really comprehensive?
 
Now here is our problem.  My wife and I own a small condo on A1A in south Boca Raton. There are 9 
other unit owners in our association.  Half of us are permanent residents that take advantage of the 
Homestead exemption, the other half are seasonal residents.  We have decided as an association, 
that we should take a pro-active approach to hurricane mitigation. We have hired an engineer to do 
preliminary studies as to what we can do to reinforce our building.  Our engineer has concluded 
several options that would make our building stronger.  In addition to some structural additions the 
engineer suggested hurricane force impact resistant glass. We as an association, agreed to look into 
the engineers suggestions.  After getting several price quotes for the above mentioned work it was 
established that the preliminary estimate for the work to be about 400,000 or about 40,000 per unit.  
We also decided that this was a large cost and to look into bank financing in order to facilitate  the 
construction as the final construction cost is unknown until completion.  

What we have found is that because we are a small condo, and half of our residents don't homestead 
that we are not eligible for any short term loans. We have been told by several banks that they don't 
give loans to associations under 50 units. The  my safe florida home program only covers residential 
units of 4 units or under. 

Although we live in a very pricey portion of the state, we all are average income people that were 
fortunate enough to purchase a home when prices were still reasonable.

My question to you and your staff, is there any programs available for our situation. We really would 
like to be pro-active and fortify our building, however without some type of financial help,  it may force 
some of our residents (myself included) to  have to move due to the financial hardship that would be 
placed on us if we had to come up with the 40,000 on our own. 

Any information you may provide would be of great assistance in helping to solve this most pressing 
and possibly life altering  issue.  

Sincerely

Subject:	tax inequities

Dear Governor Bush,
            Ten years ago my husband and I bought our “retirement” home in Pinellas County, Florida.  We were unable to move to Florida at that time but looked forward to the day we could.  Now, with retirement right around the corner, we will not be able to move to Florida due to the exorbitant taxes on our house.  Ten year ago the taxes were $3000 a year.  This year our taxes will be 14,491.  That’s an 11,500 increase – or nearly a  400% increase.  A home on the same street as our house in Florida with the same assessed value has taxes of 4000 for this year. There is great inequity in the taxing structure and procedure if these kinds of differences exist.  Out of state property owners are being penalized as well as being discriminated against by the state of Florida.  
            Unfortunately, we like so many other people will have to go to the Carolinas or elsewhere to retire.  Florida has become a state to where only the extremely wealthy can retire. Even Floridian residents are not able to downsize into retirement homes because their property taxes will be higher in a smaller home than in their larger empty “nest”.
            I look forward to a reply.
Thank you.

Jeb, please be mindful that the biggest industry in Florida is real estate, and if we keep letting counties raise the ad valorem taxes they will drive the secondary market out of Florida, this is the non-homestead properties, properties that people from other states invest in for investments or future retirement. The market at it’s present rate will be the next big problem to face Floridians if something is not done. I would like very much to talk with the new committee but I have attempted to contact some one in the tax reform committee but with no success.

Subject:	hurricane relief

Why have we not heard of a minimal raise in the sales tax to help everyone with hurricane relief?   I have spoken to a lot of people from all walks of life and asked them that if we had a sales tax increase to be used specifically for a catastrophic fund ,and I emphasize only for this type of relief, would they be interested in supporting it? The answer was always yes. However, I also added that we would have insurance relief as well.  The insurance companies would not have to supply windstorm insurance but that they citizens would have to pay a nominal fee for that as well (with the fund....depending upon size of their house. )
I would like you to investigate this idea and see whether or not this it's feasible.
Otherwise, as we all know, the future of our housing market is in trouble.  Young people and old people will not be able to afford to live here, due to steadily increasing insurance rates.
 
Thank You very much for considering my suggestion

Subject:	[*] RE: my letter to Deerfield, Broward and Jeb Bush

 

  For some years now, as a result of Florida State legislation, owners
of
  "seasonal" property in Florida have been unjustly treated in the area
of
  property taxation. Where "homesteaders" have seen their taxes increase
by a
  maximum of 3%, many of us "Snowbirds" have been subjected to
significant
  double-digit increases.

  The situation where I live in the wintertime, Century Village East,
  Deerfield Beach, has peaked with the latest notice of proposed
property
  taxes from Ms. Lori Parrish, the County Appraiser.

  In my specific case, the assessed market value has increased by 60%
(the
  valuation as at January 1, 2006, after the major hurricanes), and it
may
  well be that this is a real market value. I do not know as I am not
  "testing" the market by putting my condo up for sale.

  But if that is the "real" value, if you apply the tax rates as
indicated by
  Ms. Parrish, my property tax will go up by 53%....that is an
outrageous tax
  increase if ever there was one.

  No one can tell me that Broward County and Deerfield Municipal
services
  increased in cost by anywhere near the proposed increase in my tax;
the
  proof of that is in the Deerfield Fire assessment which is going up
only by
  6%.

  It is well and good to hold public hearings next month, but you must
also
  realize that for many Snowbirds who will not be in Florida until
November
  cannot afford to try and attend the hearings; in many cases, the costs
would
  outweigh potential gains as a return flight and living expenses for a
couple
  of days could reach a thousand dollars.

  If your jurisdictions and the State of Florida do not want to scare
away
  investors and tourists, who come and spend millions of dollars in your
  economy, you must ensure that the proposed tax increases are
withdrawn.

  If your budgets for the coming year are so inflated as to the need for
more
  than a 50 per cent tax increase from "seasonal" property owners, as
the
  expression goes, there is something very wrong.

  Anything more than single-digit increases in the current economic
picture
  can only give rise to forced sales, decreased values, and a drop in
Snowbird
  migration.

  It is bad enough that we are captives of the property insurance
companies
  who have been authorized to obtain exorbitant increases in premiums. 
Surely
  you elected representatives have the interest of the general public
and can
  show leadership in keeping a lid on taxes.

  I would appreciate hearing your positions on this matter at your
earliest
  convenience.

  Cordially,

 Marilyn Edelstein

I should also like to add, that the group of people, me included, mostly
affected, are senior citizens, most of whom are on fixed income.   You
certainly are not permitting this group, my group, to enjoy the golden
years we have spent a lifetime working towards.

Please reconsider this horrendous increase, geared primarily to the
Canadians who assist your economy, and, have not forsaken you even
during the years when our dollar suffered in the world economy.
Don't forsake us now.

I have been living in Hillsborough County since 1992.  I just received the proposal for property taxes and am questioning my choice for home ownership in this county, in fact in this state. 
 
If you go ahead with the proposed changes, there will be many more people who will not be able to afford to live in their homes any longer. 
 
What are you doing to address this issue?  If you have no homeowners, what will happen to your tax base??
 
If more people go from homes to rentals or worse, more money will be needed from the county coffers to care the the growing indigent population of this state.
 
When are we going to look at the basics and take care of the people that have diligently paid taxes every year, but now may not be able to afford to stay in their homes?
 
Big corporations will grow, they can absorb this, but your "average Joe" may be out on the street.
 
Yes, I am angry.  I have worked hard to create a quality of life for my family and to provide shelter and sustenance.  Do not take this away from all the hard working people in Tampa!
 
I need to know what you are going to do about this?  I will go to the hearings, but most often decisions are written in stone and people are given a chance to speak, but their words fall on deaf ears.

Governor Bush:
    I was extremely pleased  to read that a commission has been appointed to address the
inequities existing within this subject.  The current system has long been outdated and
in dire need of revision.  It is full of unfair burdens, exemptions, and loop holes.  To excuse
a new home owner from his/her fair share of taxes if purchased from a disabled veteran
in a particular year is ludicrous.   I also find it extremely hard to believe that anyone living
in a $500,000 home is totally disabled, whether veteran or not, and should be assessed
their fair share.  I'm sure the panel will address these and other inequities which I'm sure
you are already aware.  Each resident of this great state should help with the services
they receive.  No individal should be totally exempt from paying real estate taxes, reductions
yes, exemptions, no.  By the way, I am a 22 year veteran with 20 percent disability which
could very easily be changed to 100 percent with a little persistence; however, my views
would not change.

Governor Bush:
 
Here in Santa Rosa County the property appraiser has increased 
appraisals dramatically this year. As a result property taxes on
single family non homestead properties, which are mostly rental 
units are increasing astronomically. For example, I own  
rental houses that will see a 40% increases in property taxes this
next year. Most of this increase will be passed on to the lower 
income renters who can hardly make ends meet as it is.
The more wealthy homeowners will only see a 3% increase due to the 
homestead laws.
 
Santa Rosa county will see an huge windfall increase in tax revenues and 
they have no intention in mitigating this massive tax increase by lowering 
millage rates. 
 
Anything you can do to help in this matter would be appreciated.
 
 
Thank you
 
Steve Gorman
 
 
 
 
Below is an e-mail response I received from one of the County 
Commissioners:
 
 
Mr. Gorman;
 
You are correct that commissioners do ultimately bear the responsibility to enact a good budget for the people of Santa Rosa County.  We need all the help we can get in this budgeting process because as you can imagine it is not an easy exercise.  
 
We did receive the possibility of $20 million dollars in new revenue due to Greg Brown's reassessments.  Ten million of that, I feel, should go to restore our reserves which have been completely depleted by Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis.  I'm sure you agree that it is  very important for us to have a rainy day account for such  terrible storm events. That would leave about $10 million dollars to be divided among cost of living increases, the sheriff's necessary budget in a rising crime wave and essential work on the county courthouse, which reflects the tremendous growth that is occurring in this county.  The legislature says that we must house all the new judges that they authorize in a safe and comfortable environment.  The old courthouse is everything but that.  However, you can help a lot by studying the budget and sharing with me where you feel the cuts should be made.  This would be extremely helpful.  Should you wise choices in your suggestions I'll  be happy to give strong consideration to them.
 
Best regards,
 
John Broxson

Mr. Broxson,

You missed the point. The commission (including you) is in charge of setting the millage rate.
If the assessments increase, the commission should reduce the millage rate
to be in line with the total county revenues from the previous year. As it stands
the county will get a massive 13 million increase over last year.
As I said, a largely disproportionate portion is borne by rental houses.

Certainly this greed will not go unnoticed if this tax increase takes place, and I suspect
we will eventually have a new set of commissioners as elections take place.

Mr. Gormanj,

Thanks for your input on the 2006/2007 budget.  Should you have challenges to your assessments please contact Mr. Greg Brown, Property Appraiser, who can advise you on how to appeal the appraisal decision should you feel that it is unfair or inaccurate.

There is an appeals process and Mr. Brown probably can advise you best on that.

Governor Bush,

 

I am very excited to hear that you have created a committee to work on property taxes.  This is impacting our real estate sales and we have long time residents leaving the state as they realize they can no longer afford to live here.

 

I am a real estate professional and close a large number of homes in a residential area in Eastern Hillsborough County.  As I am sure you are aware, we have experienced a softening in the market this year and I am confident it is a direct result of the cost of insurance and the heavy impact of property taxes.  It is a common occurrence to receive an inquiry about the possibility of relocation to a larger or smaller home from a customer and when they discover what the monthly impact of a move would be on fixed expenses they choose to stay put.  Our older customers can’t afford to move down and our upwardly mobile chooses not to increase the monthly fixed cost.    

 

I have experienced long time Floridians that love it here fleeing to our neighboring states of Georgia and Alabama to escape these expenses.  The impact of property taxes exceeds what the impact of income tax for these citizens would be.  On a recent trip to Alabama I noticed a large number of homes in excess of a million dollars being built in a lake area.  I questioned local professionals about a slow down in sales.  They said no and that they had Florida residents relocating from all regions of our state.  I understand the Carolina’s are experiencing this as well.  

 

We are experiencing annual reassessment of out tax rolls as the County Assessor attempts to keep the tax base current with the past years appreciation.  We had a large number of  families relocating from the northeast when are sales prices were lower but now with our price increases these families our finding our taxes higher than the taxes even in New York or New Jersey.     

 

We don’t have out of state families as interested in our areas and we have our local buyers paralyzed by the cost of ownership.  We must find a way to offer relief to some sector of the market or you are going to have a recession as home builders and the subs they employ find the softening turning into much more.  We are off fifty to sixty percent in sales throughout the strongest months of the year in our higher priced homes.  When I say higher priced I mean only over $500,000.  I am not referring to beach front, only suburban executive homes.  All price ranges are being affected.  Our local buyer cannot afford the property taxes that accompany the price of the homes that they are purchasing.  

 

We are hearing much about school teachers and the affordability of housing.  A increasingly large portion of that monthly payment is taxes and insurance.  I am having successful families call and suggest they need to relocate because they cannot afford the escrow payment as it now exceeds the mortgage.  

 

I am thankful that you are committed to helping find a solution to this problem.  I sincerely hope that my comments can confirm that it is imperative that we take action.  Thank you for all you do to make Florida a great place to call home.

 

 

All the Best,

Subject:	Taxes

Dear Governor Bush,,
 
We need your help.  We came down from the north in 2003 and contracted to buy a home with a reputable builder.  We moved in around September, 2004.  When we were in the purchasing stage we estimated the taxes to be around $5000/yr based on the builder's experience.  Also, there was something never discussed that became very important and that's Homesteading.   
 
After we were living in the house for a while, I was informed about homesteading through the mail so I faxed the form over.  Later we received our first tax bill for $8400/yr.  We were shocked.  My wife then went to the tax dept and found out that they never received a fax from us ,and no, I did not have a confirmation that I saved.  My wife then filed the Homestead and they said in would reflect on the next tax bill.  In the meantime, we received another tax bill for $9600/yr.  This put us at our limit to be able to afford the house.  
 
Today I called the tax dept to see if the decline in real estate prices would be reflected on our taxes and they informed me that our next bill coming is $11,000/yr.  They said the homestead takes 2 yrs to take effect.
This is insane.  Needless to say that we can't afford to pay $11,000/yr in taxes.  At this rate we are going to have to give up the house and with the market the way it is, we'll never be able to sell it with taxes this high.  We didn't spend 20 months building our dream home to find out we can't afford it because of tax increases.
 
How can this be correct?  Everybody we talk to is paying much lower.  Why are we being taxed so heavily?
 
We need help.  Someone has to know how we can get our taxes in line.
 
We have spoken with people with homes appraised at 1 million dollars and they are paying $7000/yr.  I was just appraised for $402,000 and we're at $11,000!  The biggest advantage of the homestead is the maximum 3% increase per year but when they start you so high, you never get a chance to take advantage of the 3% cap.  There needs to be a soft start for the new homeowner.  How can Florida attract new families if they can't catch the advantages that the existing families get?  So many families are putting their homes up for sale and the tax increases are a main cause.  When you buy a home you consider your income and pay for what you can afford.  When the assessed value goes up, there in no increase in anyone's income, just a hopeful advantage when you sell it.  But when the taxes increase 30 to 40% then your not able to support the house anymore and you are forced to sell.  If that's happening right now, your home has decresed in value dramatically and the taxes are still astronomical.  Basically, you'll lose everything you worked so hard for because of the system structure, not because you didn't work hard enough for it.  
 
Sir, I am begging you to help me with our personal issue and to also look at the system going forward.
 
There is a huge imbalance in our tax bill and the value of our home.  We should be at $5000 to $6000/ year with a 3% cap on every following year.
 
Please contact me as soon as possible so we can get this in line.  
 
Your help, thoughtfulness, and influence to assist us in fixing this will show what a great Governor you are.  It will also ensure us that my three children, 10, 12, and 14 yrs old, can remain in the schools they adore so much.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	Budget Cuts

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I understand that The Agency for Person’s with Disabilities is getting a budget cut of 90% this year.  Do you realize that the rise of autism in Florida is at epidemic levels, and we are one of the states with the fewest services for our children?  Today’s national statistics puts the rate of autism at 1 in every 166 children.  With states like Connecticut having only 1% rate of autism, it is states like Florida that are making up the difference.  And now Florida is cutting funding for families desperately needing assistance for their children.  It has also been proven that autism can be overcome with proper intervention at an early age.  Once our children turn 3, they are dropped from the paid services (Part C) and are put into the school system (Part B).  Our Florida school systems do NOT have enough services to properly combat the growing need for the number of children on the autism spectrum.  

 

My son has been on the med-waiver wait list since he was 3 years old.  Today he is nearly 6 and we are still waiting.   These are the years where early intervention could make a difference and they are being wasted waiting.  Now, these budget cuts are adding to that wait.  It seems a shame to me that funding could not be made more plentiful.  Instead of these children getting funding for therapies at a very young age so that they can be mainstreamed into regular education programs and grow up to live typical and productive lives, they will remain a burden on our Medicaid system requiring state funding for the entirety of their lives.  Please reconsider your decision and keep funding for our children.

 

My son received a grant through the Agency for Persons with Disabilities this past June and was able to attend Camp Thunderbird (www.Quest.com) for two weeks this summer.  He came home with skills that I could not teach him, nor could the Orange County school he has been enrolled in for the past two years.  Without having the ability to attend that camp, my son may have never learned to use the toilet on his own.  I know of autistic children still in pull-up at the ages of 9 and 10.

Subject:	[*] Fl Statutes 723.031(5)(c)

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing about Florida Statutes 723.021(5)(c)  the pass-along tax to mobile home residents of mobile home parks. 
I believe this law is unconstitutional and totally unfair. If the owners of mobile home parks can pass-along their real estate tax responsibilities  to
people who don't even own real estate why can't I pass along my mobile home taxes for both the mobile home and the additions to it to the owner
of the park where I rent a lot? Of course, I don't prescribe to this but it would be a fair exchange don't you think? I prescribe to the notion that I own
the mobile home and whatever the taxes are they are my responsibility and I prescribe to the notion that the same goes for the mobile home park owner
or owners. 
 
If I am required by law to pay a portion of his taxes, why don't I have a like portion of interest in the land? If he sales, do we get anything? Of course 
not but we've paid the taxes so he can keep the property. Does that sound fair or reasonable? If we pay a portion of the taxes then we should have a 
say in the ownership of the land. Nothing else is fair. We pay out money and receive nothing in return. Now I realize you could argue that we get a place
to put our home but we got that with the lot rent. We don't need to pay for it twice.
 
I feel the people who rent lots in mobile home parks or apartments do so because they can't afford  real estate and this law hurts them. I don't believe
the framers of our constitution intended for property owners to be able to pass their tax obligations onto the shoulders of non real estate owners. I can't
perceive of this being fair, just or lawful. 
 
Every year the owners of these parks increase the rent to the extend permitted by law or so close to it, amounts to the same thing. Now I don't know much 
about parks that I haven't lived in but the park I live in now does nothing to improve the place. We have to keep up an continual battle to even get the lawns
mowed and when they do mow them they don't clean up after themselves, (The lawn mowing is one of the things the high lot rent is supposed to take care of.)
We have to follow up and clean up their messes. However I realize that things increase in prices and the rent increase I can tolerate and I'll keep doing battle to 
have my place kept nice. I totally disagree with the above referenced law and would like to know how to start a movement for its repel. 
 
I have written my Congressman, Mr. Mica, my Representative, Mr.Patterson, and another Representative, Mr. Baker, and requested they consider my views and
give me some guidance. 
 
I'm not doing this just for myself but for all the people I personally know that struggle everyday to survive. Most of them are on fixed incomes and they can hardly
afford food and medicine yet the State tells us we are required by law to pay the taxes of a man that lives high on the hog, takes vacations (while most of the people 
here are stuck at home) and lives 'the good life' at our expense. It's  almost beyond belief to me that our representatives could have come up with and passed such a law in the first place. Passing it doesn't necessarily make it constitutional does it?
 
I look forward to your reply.

Subject:	Property Tax Legislation

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Thank you for taking an interest in the property tax issues our state is having and will continue to have until something is ironed out.

I have personally bought and sold property in various states and cannot understand why we cannot look to other states for the answers to our problems.

 

In Illinois they have a reassessment every four years on property taxes. This allows a buyer or seller not to get socked with a huge increase on all property, commercial as well as residential. The growth is continual as the assessments are divided into four areas which in turns promotes a continual base of growth for the state coffers and an expected increase for all property owners.

 

Easiest and most desirable is Prop 13 from California. Basic and to the point it promotes growth based on sales price and a one percent constant. Any buyer of commercial or residential real estate can figure out what their taxes will be to date of purchase and can also generate a finite number for the increases to come in future years. 
This will promote stability and growth especially on the commercial sales for a variety of reasons. First and foremost you can establish a set amount of money you will need this year and each following year for your budget and adjust your budget for future years. This works not only for commercial but also for residential. If a quick study was done by just averaging all property in the smallest county and using the Prop. 13 method the numbers will quickly show that the state will not lose and should actually gain from this position as well as spreading the tax throughout instead of burdening the new owners. Another plus will be people will be able to sell their property without issues from taxes and gain on the amount of sales increasing which in turn will increase the doc. Stamps due on sale. Which can be raised a percent or less to help add to the coffers from any decrease the state may see from the percentage cap. Another thought is maybe we can increase the California idea to 1.25 or 1.5 percent of the purchase price, whatever numbers make sense. Also there can be a rollback on sold properties through out the state which may not make everyone happy but will be fair in the long run to all involved.

 

 

 

Here is an example of what happened to me and my customer. 
I sold a motel across the street from the beach in Treasure Island due to the income could not support our insurance, taxes and provide a profit for my family to live on. My neighbor across the street has had his taxes increased from $55,000.00 to $112,000.00 due to my sale and the sale of neighboring properties. When he approached the county of Pinellas with the drastic increase he was told to sell to developers if he could not afford the new tax bill. Either way the state will lose if he sells out we lose another beachfront motel that brings in tourists as well as a place for locals to come to in the off season. So in affect we lose sales tax dollars not only from the nights lost lodging but restaurant, pubs, grocery stores and more. Trickle down effect will not help anyone in our state.

Hi Governor Bush my name is Jane Van Etveldt  and I have a serious issue that I hope you can help me and my neighbors out with.  I’ve recently heard that you have a commission looking into the increase of insurance on communities; well my community has just informed us that we will be assessed $3,000.00 dollars for increased insurance and to cover repairs in the future.  There are I would say more than half the community that can’t afford this, and they want this done in a timely manor, we feel as if we’re being taken advantage of.  Our insurance is going up from $119,000.00 to $767,586.20 and the repairs assessment is for $270,877.00, which I don’t understand isn’t that what our insurance for??? I was hoping that you could take some time out of your busy day and help us out, this is crazy!!!! And because of this many hard working people will indefinitely lose our homes because of this. I would love to see a state audit take place immediately there has got to be something someone can do to reduce this crazy assessment.  Numbers you can reach me at are work M-F 8:30 to 5:00 954/360-0944 and my home 561/752-3023. PLEASE I’m IN A DESPERITE WAY and DON”T WANT TO LOSE MY HOME!!!!

I have been in Florida 36 years, but I may be forced to leave this area.  I was set to retire last January, but I am forced to continue to work - why, because of the outrageous insurance premiums the government is letting the insurance companies get away with.  I have paid homeowners insurance for 36 years and have filed one claim in all of the those years, for a new roof 2 years ago because of Hurricane Francis.  So the insurance company paid out $9,000 for a new roof.  What have they been doing with my premiums over these 36 years.  Oh, I know, giving the profits to the stock holders.  Well, it's time the stockholders start paying the insurance premiums for the hard working people in Florida that have put millions into their pockets.  My insurance was dropped this year, because of course I had Poe.  I have tried to find insurance elsewhere, but because my house is 16 years old most companies won't write it, even though I have a new roof.  Those that will write it have given me quotes of more than 3 times what I paid in the past.  My house payments are $12,000 a year and they was to write my insurance for $7,000 a year.  How can this be a fair price.  My insurance is 5,000 less per year than my whole house payment.  This must stop and Florida MUST get their residence relief or you will find a mass exodus of residence in the very near future.  My daughter has just remarried a man with 2 children and she has two children, so her 2 bedroom house is no longer practical for her, but they want to buy a bigger house and have found that they can't buy one because of the insurance factor once again.  What does it take to get the State of Florida to stop the gouging of insurance companies and send their stock holders and CEO's and officers to the reality of the real world and stop living the high life they are living on our money. 
 
At this point, I am seriously looking to move to another state.  Our insurance, be it home and auto is at least twice the cost of say North Carolina.  Why, because the Florida politicians have let the insurance companies get away with it.

The Family Café began with a simple dream: educating and empowering people with disabilities and their families, so they could participate fully in society. 

Thanks to much hard work, and the financial support of the State of Florida, that dream has become a reality. The Family Café Annual Conference has grown from a simple vision to become the largest, most successful statewide conference of its kind in the nation, hosting over 10,000 individuals this past June. 

Sadly, THAT DREAM IS NOW IN JEOPARDY. 

The State of Florida has informed The Family Café that 

THE BUDGET FOR THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE 

WILL BE CUT BY 90%! 

This puts the entire Annual Conference in danger of being CANCELLED!

We believe that THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, and we believe you will feel the same way. 

Informed families make better decisions and build effective partnerships that improve outcomes for children and adults with disabilities. Floridians with disabilities deserve a forum for education and networking; they certainly DO NOT deserve to have such an essential resource as The Family Café Annual Conference taken away by their state government. 


This is a CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE FAMILY CAFÉ. 

Will the dream die, or will it be sustained? 

WE MUST ACT NOW! This is the time to advocate for ourselves, to make our voices heard. Please take action immediately, and continue to call, e-mail and write between now and August 28th. For you family, your community, and for all of the Floridians that will benefit from the Annual Conference in future years, please SPEAK OUT TO SAVE THE FAMILY CAFÉ ANNUAL CONFERENCE TODAY!

Governor Bush,

We are native Floridians living in the Palm Beach County area with our two
children.  We built two homes as owner builder with our own blood, sweat and
tears in order to save money and keep our mortgage down.  My husband has
worked for an office equipment company for over 20 years and has a stable,
modest paying position.  I am self-employed handling administrative and
bookkeeping services for various clients.  We have found it increasingly
difficult to afford to live in South Florida.  We purchased property in
North Florida as an investment in our future.  Our tax bills just arrived
and they have reassessed values and our taxes are doubling and, possibly
tripling. You are aware of the increase of property taxes, homeowners
insurance, gas, fuel charges and more.  The average family cannot choose to
stay living in South Florida.  We are being forced to move which is not
necessarily a choice we prefer. However, the real estate market has also
dropped to the point where homes are selling for much less than 2 years ago.
It is our experience that government works slow and problems are dealt with
as the situation becomes completely unmanageable.  Our legislators and
representatives have been made aware of our concerns, we are now asking for
your intervention.

We represent others in our same situation, we are not an unusual story and
we are in need of help.

I had homeowners insurance with Poe. I knew, I was going to be cancelled, and put under Citizens insurance, in October of this year. I found insurance with Nation Wide in June. I cancelled my insurance with Poe/Citizens. I received my refund. The only thing, I am upset about, They kept a $100.00 of my refund, and now I have to pay them 2% at the end of the year as all homeowners do. I'm being double charged by the State ran insurance company. I think this is very shady. They are cheating people left and right. I'd like to now why they are getting away with this. Can your office check into this. It's not so much the money it's the principal of the whole thing. My home address 10330 Tarragon Drive. Riverview, Florida 33569. Thanking You in advance.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Mr. Bush.
     We are writng to you in a panic, as we are about to lose our 
investment property wich we acquired eight years ago for our future.  We 
are both working class citizens. Our property was assessed last year to 
have a value on the land of $26,834 this year due to developement in our 
area our value has jumped to $361,950!  I know that is great, but our 
taxes have increased to "6 TIMES" of last year, not so great!  We had 
budgeted for a small increase, but feel nobody of the working class can 
budget for this amount nor we going to be able to pay for such an 
outrageous amount. I understand homestead exemption which we do have on 
our primary residence, but obviously this property does not qualify. Is 
there not a cap in place to protect us residents? We do not want to sell!  
We are panicking, that we will have to sell our investment as there is no 
way we can pay this amount,"6 TIMES" in one year is outrageous!!!!  What 
if any options do we have? We have lived in Naples 27 years and have never 
felt such neglect as residents of the once lovely town to live in.  Hope 
you are able to help us.         

Sincerely,


Tammy and Michael McEndree

It does not appear that you or anyone on your staff cares about this problem as I have not rec'd any response nor have I seen anything reported by the media that you or someone on your staff took any action
 
No need to be concerned now.  It appears that a Democratic State Representative did take action and Citizens has changed their position saving condominium residents thousands of dollars and for many, maybe saved their homes.  Guess how many votes she will get at election time.  The answer is most of them.
 
As a registered Republican I am disgusted that I had to be rescued by a Democrat.
 
As a, soon to be registered Independent, I'll vote for those who are looking out for me and my family.  Any Republican will have to go a lot farther to earn my vote as it is apparent to me that most of the republicans just don't care!

Governor,
 
First of all I am currently a registered Republican in the State of Florida.  I only mention this so that you or who ever handles your email understands the context of my criticism.
 
The Republican part is about to lose control of Florida due to the insurance crisis.  Everytime we turn around we are all reminded as to how bad it is and how little the State of Florida is doing about it.
 
We in our community of condominiums, are now being subjected to significant abuse by the undwritting department of Citizens Insurance.  Instead of using their undwritting manual to determine the rate structure they are making up their own rules in order to rate our insurance using their much costlier "A Rate" system.
 
Under the manual rate system, the premium for  a condo association with two buildings with a total value of $2,491,000 would be about $37,374.  Even though the insured and the insured value does not meet the criteria for application of the "A Rate" system, Citizens Insurance is using the "A Rate" system anyway, resulting in a significant increase in insurance cost to the 24 residents of this association. I understand that the use of the "A Rate" system has increased the premium cost for some associations over 30%. Such unfounded cost increases will cause some residents of this 55+ community to lose their homes.  Although many residents have tried to sell their condos, the real estate market has dropped dead because of the ongoing increases of insurance.  The average market price a year ago was about $200,000; it is now about $170,000 and still going down.  Our residents are trapped.
 
This abuse of the "A Rate" system needs the attention of your office.
 
If your office does not care about this issue and do not care what Citizens Insurance is doing to the residents of this community; your office does not need to respond to my plea.  We will all understand that you do not care and even registered Republicans such as myself will understand that your office does not care about our residents nor the results of upcoming elections in the State of Florida.
 
If you office does care; please have someone contact me for more details regarding this very serious matter as well as names and contact information of those who are or have been involved it trying to protect our residents.
 
I can be easily reached by email or by the toll free number below.

Subject:	Property Taxes are Causing a great Burden

Last year I wrote to you regarding my concerns about Property Taxes in our State.  It is a terrible testimonial when your Real Estate Taxes are more then your Mortgage and Maintenance annual expenses.  I have included my e-mail from last year and Jane Marshall's reply in this e-mail.   From Jane Marshall's e-mail I quote:

 "There are currently two prefiled bills for the upcoming legislative session which would place the same assessment limitation on all residential or commercial properties as the current homestead property enjoys. These are HJR 39 and SJR 22. You may wish to encourage your friends and neighbors to contact their legislators to urge support of these proposals." 

I have received my Trim Notices (I own two Properties)……and the Real Estate Bill that does not have the Home Exemption……again this year, as in the last several years, has increased significantly.  I will once again write, how can a Property Owner Budget for a tax bill when they are notified in August…and the bill to receive full discount is due 60 days later in November.  Obviously our Florida elected Government, and that includes Governor Bush, has done absolutely nothing with either bills referred to (HJR 39 and HJR  22)to help the citizens of the State of Florida. As a voting citizen I seriously must question what if anything my State of Florida, and to include my Governor, has done for me.  I know that have collected a salary, I know they have a free Medical Coverage (I don't), I know they get a better Retirement Plan then I do, I know they have much better Benefits than I Have and all I have is a Real Estate Tax Bill that has once again increased again this year by a significant amount. I hear of people and businesses selling their properties because they can no longer afford to pay the taxes due to the recent years of increases. That is a sad state of affairs………..  

When might the citizens of our State see any shred of evidence that our elected officials truly have our interest at heart as opposed to their own Personal Interest.  

What is the status of these two bills, or other bills that will bring some relief to Citizens of Florida that own two homes?

I await a reply which I must accept as last year reply, will not come directly from Governor Bush.

DATE:  November 17, 2005 

TO:  Dennis Brotman 

FROM:  Jane Marshall, Tax Law Specialist, Property Tax Technical Unit Your email to Governor Bush was forwarded to this office for response because the Department of Revenue is the state agency charged with the responsibility of providing information pertaining to the local property tax to Florida property owners. Your concern, as with many others, is the rising values and property taxes in Florida. You note that a primary residence is capped at 3 percent but also that non-resident and second home properties in Florida do not enjoy this protection. You also propose appraising property on an index of 50 percent rather than exempting the first $25,000 due to the fact that many who use the same government services pay no taxes because their property is valued at less than $25,000. The Florida Legislature is aware of the skyrocketing property values and taxes for all residents of Florida. There are currently two prefiled bills for the upcoming legislative session which would place the same assessment limitation on all residential or commercial properties as the current homestead property enjoys. These are HJR 39 and SJR 22. You may wish to encourage your friends and neighbors to contact their legislators to urge support of these proposals. 

In the meantime, non-residents can appeal the amount of their assessment through an informal conference with the property appraiser, the county value adjustment board and finally the circuit court. 

However, if the value of the property is not at issue, each taxing authority is required to compute the "rolled-back rate" defined as that millage rate which will provide the same ad valorem tax revenue for each taxing authority as was levied during the prior year". (Emphasis

supplied) See section 200.065(1), Florida Statutes. Even if the fair market value or assessed taxable value of substantially all property in the county were to increase at a uniform rate, most taxpayers would not incur any significantly increased tax bill if the "rolled-back rate" were adopted. Each year, on the Notice of Proposed Taxes sent out by the property appraiser, there is a listing of the taxing authorities levying the actual tax on your property. There are listed the times and places of the budget hearings. These are public hearings at which you may speak directly to the officials who are levying the tax. Prior to the hearings, the taxing authorities are required to publish the proposed budgets for the ensuing fiscal year. We encourage taxpayers to become involved in the budget and hearing process in order help alleviate the type situation that you describe. 

This response is not a policy statement or interpretation of state law or rules, but is provided for your information and assistance since the Department of Revenue does not administer property tax. 

NOTE:  If you should decide to communicate with us by e-mail again, please bear in mind that the Department of Revenue does not currently provide a secure site for Internet communication and cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any information sent to us by e-mail. We recommend that you send confidential information to us by mail rather than e-mail. You can write to us at:

How can people Budget for unknown and extremely high increasing Property taxes? 
  
Since these taxes are paid going forward, there is no way a consumer can budget to be prepared for the Property Tax bill which is due in November when 1st Notice is the Notification sent out in August.  I realize your primary resident is capped at 3%, but a second home, or someone not living in the State does not enjoy that protection.  The Property Tax program needs to be examined and changed so that people can better budget to pay the Tax Bill....especially now that these taxes have increased at extremely high yearly increases.  Why should an owner of a Home appraised at $25,000 or less PAY NO Property Taxes.  They use the same Government facilities as others and are entitled to the same Government programs, even more then those who own property appraised in excess of $25,000.00.  A better way to make the Florida Property Tax system more far would be an index.  That is, all homes would be appraised but taxed only on a State Fixed Percentage number. 

ie....house appraised at 50,000.; index 50%...taxable figure $25,000, etc.  Using a method like this will more fairly spread the Tax Burden to ALL. 

  
While on the subject of Taxes.......when an individual can't make ends meet  they have no easy way to pass the shortage on to someone. 

Government simply passes their shortages onto Tax payers who are already strapped by high costs of energy, food, etc......as opposed to really taking a good look at their spending habits and looking for areas to reduce expenses and ....waste.  It is simply to easy just to pass it on to the Citizens of the State.  We need people running our State who care about the citizens and look to reducing the burden of High Taxation....I don't see this happening in our State and can voice my op

I purchased a home in Pinellas County on September 30, 2004. I placed my other home in Brevard county for sell after the September 30th purchase. I removed homestead exception on the Brevard County home in December 2005 so I could apply for homestead on my Pinellas County home for the year 2006. FYI: The Brevard County home sold (February 28, 2006). I recently received my proposed taxes for the year of which was increased almost 100%. The home I purchased in Pinellas County was built in 1957 on Indian Bluff Island. I paid $195,000.00 for the home and expected an increase of taxes based upon the purchase price and not the market value. My home was accessed for $340,000.00 for this year and taxes are roughly $7,000.00 per year. Homestead exception did kick in this year but the $25,000.00 does not even make a dent in the amount of taxes owed. Furthermore there are homes in this neighbor which are much more valuable then ours and their taxes are substantially less. It does not make any sense. And now we are faced with increases in our homeowner's insurance.  Complaining about it "hell ya". I served my country when your  father took on Iraq and was damn proud to be part of it. Never had second doubts about being part of the military and the missions we were assigned. But now having second doubts seems to be an everyday occurrance. You always try to make sense out of things but, now in my early 50's, one wonders what path we are embarking on. I have worked hard trying to retire by the time I reach 62 years of age but this may all change with the proposed increases. Things are basically out of control and now I have concerns about being able to stay in Florida. I know you have much on your plate just like your brother does but if you can provide some insight it would be greatly appreciated.

Honorable Governor Jeb Bush:

 

                        I am sending this e-mail to you, and posting it on my blog at http://ercian.blogspot.com. The home insurance crisis has reached such levels that it calls for action on your part as Governor of the state of Florida.

            On August 15, 2006, El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish division of the Miami Herald, published a couple of reader’s comments under Perspectivas complaining about the abusive increases in home insurance coverage. Rightfully so, one signed by Juan Estajen called for you and the state legislature to find a solution to the situation, one that may include forcing companies that insure automobiles in our state to also insure our homes. Another one was from Luisa Pérez, a retired woman of modest means who feels not only abused, but also disrespected. Her insurance premium went from $3,200 to $7,710 a year.

            Now, please allow me to tell you about my mother’s situation. She is an 86 years old widow receiving a little over $600.00 a month from Social Security. Her savings are down to about two thousand dollars. The new insurance policy from State Farm just arrived. The premium went from $1990 (more or less. I do not remember the exact figure) to $5,486. The property taxes amounting to another $2000 or so will arrive shortly. How is she going to meet those obligations? Will she lose her house? Were they in vain, all the sacrifices her and my father made?

            Where is the Insurance commissioner in all this? How could he have approved such huge increases? There is no excuse whatsoever for allowing this crisis to happen. Right or wrong, it gives the average citizen the impression our public officials and the insurance companies are on very friendly terms. 

            Regardless of your accomplishments as a Governor, if you do not fix this situation, your tenure in office will be a catastrophic period for the people of the state, and your reputation tarnished. Please act and act now. My mother’s bill is due early November. If you have to appeal to the federal government, do so with all the force required. Let them know how bad it is down here. Please let me know what steps you are taking to resolve this situation.

 

                                                                                                 Yours truly,        Joseph Marchante, 13231 SW 67th St. Miami, Florida

Subject:	Save Our Homes amendment & property taxes

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
        We have just read an article in the Aug. 16, 2006 issue of our local newspaper, "The Northwest Florida Daily News", about your committee "looking into alleged property tax inequities resulting from the state constitutional measure" of 1992, the Save Our Homes amendment.  There is a definite inequity among homeowners when it comes to property taxes.  We had lived in our Florida home from July 1990 - Jan. 2004, then moved in Jan. 2004 to another Florida home we'd bought and sold in April 2005, then moved again into the current Florida home we now own in June 2005.  During both moves, we have been most definitely negatively affected by this Save Our Homes amendment.  We are not happy about it at all.
 
        Several days ago we received Okaloosa County's Notice Of Proposed Property Taxes and Proposed or Adopted Non-Ad Valorem Assesments.  We have spoken to several neighbors about this notice, and we have looked at the publicly available tax information in our neighborhood.  There is a definite disparity between what we will be paying in property taxes this year and what our neighbors will be paying.  Our taxes will be twice what most of our neighbors will be paying, even though our home is smaller in square footage than most of the homes in our neighborhood, all of which are newer than ours, a number of which also have a pool.  And this is with our Homestead Exemption!
 
        We feel this is most unfair, and we are not happy about it.  We homeowners are under higher cost of living increases lately:  higher house insurance rates (if we can get insurance at all when our previous insurance companies drop us), higher natural gas prices, significantly higher oil/gasoline prices, with all the other price increases that result from that, etc. etc.  Florida is a wonderful state to live in, but with all of these higher costs, it will soon make it cost prohibitive to live here or move here.  We respectfully request your help in lowering this cost burden for us.
 
        Either everyone in our neighborhood pays the lower property tax rates, or it is averaged out so that new homeowners are not hit by such enormously higher rates from losing the Save Our Homes feature.
 
Thank you for your time and trouble,

Dear Jeb,
  Just wanted to say good bye.Just received a TRIM notice indicating another 29% increase in my property taxes.Like many other non-residents I have decided to vote with my feet and will be selling my property and leaving Florida.
  It took me awhile to get it but we don't vote and you don't care.Long term the State of Florida cannot continue to finance it's fiscal obligations on the back of the non resident citizens of the state.The economic collapse that will be precipitated by our mass exodus will be like nothing the state has ever experienced.Your failure to act to remedy this situation will long tarnish the reputation of your administration.

Subject:	Tax Time

Trim notice time again, and the property tax assessors office is licking their chops. The worn-out line “your house will be assessed at current market value” gives the assessors office a blank check, to withdraw money from your pocket. I believe the property tax system here is extremely unfair, mainly because “market value” has risen so insanely in the past few years. People with a home here, who for some reason can’t legally homestead, have been “market valued” to death, causing many to sell or go in debt. 

For one example, say you bought a home in Sarasota four years ago, you lived in it but for some reason couldn’t legally homestead it. The way property values have been rising recently, your tax bill has probably doubled or tripled… The unfair “market value” blank check shakedown.   

For another example, two moderately-priced brand new homes were built side by side four years ago. One was occupied and homesteaded, one was bought as a second home by middle-class people who wanted a home to retire to in a few years. Today, four years later, the people with the homestead are still there, but the house next door has a for sale sign because the people who wanted to come down here and retire can no longer afford the property taxes which have tripled in four years. The unfair “market value” shakedown again. This should be a crime. There needs to be limits! I really think the mafia helped write the tax laws in the state of Florida. Why should the state and local government be the only ones who enjoy the increased value of our homes?   

My solution? Right now my “market value” is equal to my “assessed value”. Cap the “assessed value” at a max of 5-7% per year for residential single family homes, regardless of homestead, and issue an official document to all home-buyers stating that the local assessor has a blank check written on your bank account if you don’t or can’t homestead. Then give examples of properties that have doubled or tripled in value in the past four years, leaving non-homesteaded people giving it all away to the government. This should be part of a legal form designed to be a warning and signed by anyone buying a home down here.   

Will this cause great loss of money to government services? Probably not. Right now, for many people who in the past few years couldn’t homestead, government is the primary beneficiary to our insanely increased property values. Again, a crime.

Subject:	property tax relief

Dear Governor Bush,
   Recently every homeowner in Florida has received a proposed property tax
form for 2006.  We have a second residence in St. John's County (St.
Augustine).  Our assessment has been increased in one year by 25%.  Since we
purchased the condominium in 2000, our taxable value has doubled.  We need
help in tax relief.  I feel these high tax assessments are unfounded as
property values are declining in this area since the hurricanes of 2004.

    Our primary residence is in Gainesville, and these property assessments
have also increased substantially.  Our "citizen" owned utility has raised
homeowner rates because "we need more income because the customers are using
less utilities," after Gainesville Regional Utility requested homeowners
reduce their consumption.  Instead of being rewarded for conservation we get
higher rates, which also impacts local taxes on utility charges.  They get a
double increase. Incidentially they have NOT raised business rates in years
and businesses are a large consumer of our utilities.  We need relief here
as well.  This utility is abusing the "owners" with higher rates when
businesses get free services or reduced rates.

   My husband and I are frustrated at the lack of concern by local
politicians and county/city taxing authorities.  I am sure we are not alone
in feeling Florida's local governments are abusing the taqpayers.

     We need your help.  Please advise what I can do to assist in getting
relief on these over bearing taxes and charges for utilities.  Discussion
with local representatives falls on deaf ears.

Dear Governor,
 
I have been a resident, homeowner and loyal Republican in Florida since 1989. I was called today and advised by my insurance company that they would no longer carry insurance on my home at 14558 Anchorage Circle Seminole, FL 33776.
Apparently they (Liberty Mutual) no longer want to insure certain properties in this state and mine is one of them. I am not surprised, but certainly I'm not alone since a lot of media attention has been paid recently to the rate increases and outright cancellations of homeowner policies. Since my mortgagor demands I have my home insured, I have no choice. 
Does the government of ths state want me to relocate to a different state? Or is someone in Government going to do something?
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to you in regards to our homeowner's insurance, we have Citizen's Insurance, as well as everyone else here in Florida. Please don't tell me to contact my Congressman because it is useless. I live in Pasco County  and Pasco County is the ones paying the highest rate for insurance, and the rates are to go up again. This is outragious. 
My husband and I moved down here 15 years ago because we thought it would be a great place to raise our four kids, and when were old enough retire. But, at this point there is no recourse for this to happen. When we lived up North we would always see commercials advertising "come see the palm trees and sunshine of Florida". Well, we see that but not much more. With the rates of the homeowner's insurance going up it is making people move out of this state. Here, there are new schools being built for the overcrowding but that won't matter because there won't be any overcrowding by years end.
I am asking if there is something you can do as our Governor to stop this rising cost of Citizen's Insurance. There are no other companies out there writing new policies. I am not the only one that feels this. Again, don't tell me to contact my Congressman because it does no good. Can you do something to help our resident of Florida fromm losing our homes? Please!
 
Sincerly,
Susan Ouellette

Dear Governor Bush,
 I am sure this is one of many letters you have been receiving in 
reference to the crisis of rising insurance in our state. I am one of 
those people that almost can't afford to live here much longer if 
things keep increasing. If they do continue to increase I too will have 
to make a decision between my medicines or my home and I am not even a 
Senior citizen yet ! I will have to sell and leave the state after 
living here for 28 years.
However, I have an idea ? If the "LARGEST" Insurance companies want to 
pull out of writing homeowners policies in our state then let them take 
their auto, health plans, retirement, and any other plans they offer 
with them ! In fact if they won't write policies in our state , lets 
take their advertising dollars away from them also. Either we could  
make it so cost prohibitive they can't afford to advertise in our great 
state or pass a bill stating write all policy's or write none at all. I 
am so sick of seeing State Farm, or Nationwide ads or other Insurance 
ads on television only to find they will be happy to take your money 
for auto coverage, but not your home ?
You can't have you cake & eat it  too ! Pass a bill throw them out of 
our state until they comply----all or nothing !
I know you are busy, and I voted for you. I feel you have always kept 
Florida in your heart & have done a great job protecting our state. You 
will be sorely missed.
Thank You

I am a small commercial property owner in West Palm Beach, and own a number of office/warehouse buildings west of I-95.  These properties had been insured by Nationwide Insurance for the last 20 years.  Nationwide has canceled the insurance policy for the property located at 1300 North Florida Mango Road as of July 28, 2006, and will be canceling the insurance for the properties located at 1100 and 1500 North Florida Mango Road on October 24, 2006.  As of today we have not been able to procure any insurance for 1300 North Florida Mango Road which is an 84,054 square foot building from any admitted or surplus lines insurer.  Within fifteen (15) days our mortgagee will force place insurance at the rate of $52,000.00 PER MONTH or $624,000.00 per year!  This is for $4,000,000 coverage and $800,000 of business interruption insurance.  Our current premium for similar coverage is $47,000.00 per year.  Not only does this situation threaten my financial ruin but will destroy the thirty (30) or so small businesses that are our tenants.  This problem is critical and getting worse everyday!  We need immediate relief and can not wait for the politicians to debate the issue to find a resolution which will then take additional time to implement!

Honorable Governor Bush,

 

 

            I have a major question I was hoping you could explain. I do know of the legislation behind the action; however, I need to know the justification for the result.

 

            My family and I recently purchased my grandmothers home and moved about three miles down the street from our former home. The property taxes on my grandmother’s home last year were $3,319.18. The proposed tax estimate for this home in 2007 is $4,842.75. My personal income rose last year by 3.2%. I believe the inflation rate was just over that amount as well. Can you please justify why my government needs a 45.9% increase in my property taxes? Is government spending that much out of control? 

 

            I was born and raised in Tampa. Like so many other native Floridians, I’m afraid that my family and I will soon be forced to move to a more affordable state. With homeowners insurance rates doubling every two years and substantial tax penalties for relocation within Florida, you will soon have a state consisting of the very wealthy and the very poor, with little to no middle class.

 

            I look forward to an explanation as to why you believe an additional 45.9% in property taxes is needed by my government.

 

 

Thank you,

Dear Mr. Crist,

I understand you will be in the Pensacola area in the
near future and would like to make you aware of a
brewing issue that should become a campaign issue.

Both Escambia and Santa Rosa counties are in the
process of taking advantage of the post hurricane
housing market (which has since subsided) to create
windfall revenues from property taxes. Both counties
tout these as a "non increase" since millage rates may
not increase. The game is to "reassess" all properties
to increase the revenue. 

While laws prevent a primary residence from being
affected by more than 3%, investment real estate has
no such protection. I own properties in both Escambia
and Santa Rosa counties and am seeing huge increases
in the proposed 2006 taxes. (Escambia county increase
is 400%)   

As an investor, I can not "eat" the increases and will
have to pass it on to renters. They are usually of
lower or fixed income and we all hear the need for
"affordable rent". In this case affordable rent is
being taken away by the government.  

Additionally property values on the beaches will go
down, and new construction will come to a halt causing
job losses in an area devoid of much industry.
Tourism will suffer due to the higher rental rates,as
tourists have a choice between the Alabama beaches and
Northwest Florida. Again, this will bring on a loss of
service industry jobs. 

I'd ask that as future governor you address this
situation that affects all real estate investors. The
short sightedness of the local governments in this
area will affect the future of Florida. 

I'm also copying Mr. Bush to see if he can do
something short term to stem this tide. 

Thank you for the time.

Sincerely,

David Gorman

Sandy:
 
I suggest you come over here and see our place so you can get a first have perspective of what our place is.
 
You must have given them the WRONG Address there is a new Atlantic Villas in New Symrna Beach (approx 10 miles south), did you give them that address.
 
GL and Wind was $2400.00 in 2005.  400% of that would be $9,600, however what about the $4300 for GL We paid.  $14,000 is almost 600% increase!!
 
Based on the Allstate policy of $2400.00 for GL and Wind and hurricane at $500 deductible our wind and hurricane was about 50% of the premium or $1200.00.  400% of that is $4800.00.  Where are you folks getting your numbers from, I have them here in front of me.  
I suggest you contact Allstate Vickie O'Donnel 386 767-3040.  Policy number [REDACTED].  
 
Our Address of the building insured is:
Atlantic Villas 
3764 South Atlantic Av
Daytona Beach Shores, Fl 32118
 
What is the replacement value on a $33,000 Wind policy on a $750,000 Building??
 
As I wrote earlier there is an Atlantic Villas on Atlantic Av in New Symrna Beach did they use this address?????

When we submit the app we give the address and they run the quote for us. I was told by the company that the premiums have been  raised by 400%. This is a government program and they set the rates like flood insurance. The quote for the $10,900 was for the hurricane part of the premium and for total wind coverage the premium is $33,000. I did fax the quote back to the company though to get some ded variables and coverage variables and will e-mail them to you when I get them.

So what you are telling me then the condos across the street on the ocean must have a $150,000 wind policy if they are 60 units and we are 5 at for $33,000. 

You told me the wind was going to be close to the GL not 8 times that.  GL is $4200.  What can we bring it down to with reduced converge.

The rates are set by the state. We can reduce the coverage to get the rate down. Let me know. You are in the wind pool designated by the state of Florida so we can't even get a property policy that will write it with wind because the companies won't do it. It really puts everyone in a bad position!! I am so sorry.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am writing with my concern regarding the new insurance rates I have to pay this year.

Last year in 2005, I paid roughly $250.00 a year for my share in our Master Condo Policy.

This year starting in July 2006, my share is now $1,675.00. I cannot afford this. I am a single 

parent with two children, retired Navy veteran and working a 40-hour week. 

My current plan is to sell my condominium and rent an apartment for cheaper living expenses. 

Due to the increase in insurance pricing and the fact we are required to carry such insurance,

does not leave much wiggle room for fixed income families. 

 

I am sure there is much talk of a solution on the hill, but we need action now.

TO:  Florida Legislators
 
Yesterday was a dark day for Florida. The Governor and his cabinet found an old provision on the legislativ e shelf to activate an "Insurance  pool" to rescue the business  owners of the state.  While I agree it was necessary to address the business property insurance problem, I believe it should have been a part of an overall resolution to alleviate the property insurance crisis not only for busines owners, but for the homeowners who after all, are the customers for the businesses just bailed out and the people who pay to operate the State of Florida including the legislature.
 
By  this action,  the emergency and crisis status has been reduced and thus, the priority of addressing the homeowner's crisis has been diminished.  What instead should have ben done is  for the governor to have called a special session to address the entire crisis and find a solution applicable to homeowners as well as for business.  
 
The problem clearly is that Citizen's Property Insurance is insufficienty braodly based leading to its failure to deal with the homeowner's crisis. Coverage mst be far more broadly based while there is a need to put a cap on the maximum exposure by comercial insurance companies making it feasible for them to re-enter the market.  Yes, this may mean public financial underwriting of some of the risk. But the public already pays billions via disaster assistance programs at federal, state and local levels. 
 
The fallacy of the  present system is illustrated by the South Miami Dade  Dixie Hwy  division of risk. East of Dixie Hwy, commercial lines refuse to write windstorm  forcing residents into Citizens. But Country Walk which was destroyed by   Andrew  is west of Dixie as are many flood zones such as Sweetwater.   On a national scale,  disasters can and have hit across the country as tornadoes devastate entire communities, floods in the Northeast  ravage large areas, fires all over burn homes and earthquakes in the west threaten millions of residents.  
    The problem is national as is the cost exemplified by what happened last year with Katrina and other  storms. The resolution therefore must also be national but at the least, statewide.  It is wrong to  make homeowners pay horrendous premiums  which can reach $5-10,000 for average homes under the threat of foreclosure by banks. This borders on extortion and has led to unaffordability of homeownership by more and more people.  There is a resolution for this and it is not  for the Florida Cabinet and Legislature to  save  businesses while putting the homeowner on the backburner.
    I urge you to elevate this to the highest priority and demand a special session to resolv e the crisis not only for the business owner, but also for the  homeowner.

Governor Bush,
  HELP !I know you get thousands of these e-mails but here is another one! I recently wrote you about my homeowners insurance premium putting and unbearable burdon on me and my family. My mortgage went up 500.00 monthly because of my insurance. And thats with a 5000.oo dollar deductable! Make no mistake about it in two more months I will loose my home.
    Today the owners of the shopping plaza my art and framing store is in came in to inform me we need to share
a 27000.00  increase in building insurance, my portion being about 10.000 dollars.
     I really didn't like the brush off message I got from the last email. I want to know what I can do. Is the State going
to do anything to fix the insurance mess? Are you going to let this county rot.
  The facts are that the reason for the insurance increase is mostly do  to sink holes. Pinellas County should actually bear some of the burdon, as that where all the water that used to be under our properties has gone! The wells keep pumping, the water keeps going south, the ground drops out and the premiums go up. The STATE should post a warning about moving to Pasco, Just like a home owner has to post a warning about a sinkhole home. I think the State needs to come out with some answers, some funding, some warnings, SOMETHING.!!!!! 
   If you are just going to brush this message off again, please have the courtesy to furnish me with the emails
of someone, a committee, a branch of government that cares about,  or IS actually in control of the state of this STATE. I  don't need you to email me with a generic my florida.com.

Subject:	TAX INCREASES

Dear Governor Bush:

I am a new resident of South Daytona (Volusia County) and the state of
Florida.  I would like to take a minute of your time to pass along my
thoughts on the state of the state as seen from my perspective as a
retiree...

Our county school board has proposed a 8.1% increase in the assessed value
of homes.  The city has increased the assessed value of properties on the
east side of the railroad tracks and the beach advisory board and Ponce
Inlet and Port District Advisory Board want to combine and increase taxes as
well.  Halifax Medical Center has gotten permission to increase their
physical space which will no doubt result in a tax increase.  Our city
charges onerous fees for building/other permits which our tax dollars
already cover.

The average pay raise for retired persons is approximately 3% or less and
insurance premiums increase that amount resulting in no raise (for those of
us lucky enough to have insurance).
The retired person has had a significant loss in buying power for the past 5
to 10 years.

If the taxing authorities continue to raise taxes and assessments retirees
will either lose their homes due to foreclosure or sell and move back
"north" or not come to Florida at all.
I urge you, through executive order, to put a cap on taxes and roll back
assessments to the 2004 level.  Residents on fixed incomes may then be able
to survive; a tax decrease would be a godsend.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
James L. Russell, Jr.

Honorable Jeb Bush,
 
I was saddened to learn that in a meeting last week with yourself, Shelley Brantley, Agency for Persons with Disabilities David Coburn of the Ways and Means Committee and Representatives of the Family Café; the Family Café was advised that their Annual Conference and Governors Summit on Disabilities would not be funded this year.
It would not even appear on the budget as it is viewed as a state-funded party.  I am very surprised by this attitude as Shelly Brantley conducts several of the workshops and you speak at them allowing for a Q & A session. I would have thought you would have know what a valuable service they were providing. 
 
I am writing this evening to urge Shelly Brantley to submit a Budget Amendment Request to the Florida Legislature to fully fund the Annual Conference immediately.  I am also contacting Leslie Waters and my other area Representatives, asking for your support to allow funding for the Family Café to continue to hold their annual meetings and workshops.  Over 10,000 individuals attended the last conference in June, 2006.  While there may be a festive atmosphere for the children these are serious hands-on workshops. 
 
I am the mother and grandmother of disabled children. Although I never brought the little ones, I know some families do.  I attend these meetings to obtain valuable information to help foster independence in my loved ones.  This is a very empowering experience.  These meetings and contacts have been a life saver for us.  We just can’t allow the Conference to be cut.  In closing I have listed just a few of the  workshops I have attended.  This years conference offered 150 sessions to choose from, so I have limited the list to print on one page. As my family’s situation changes, so do the topics of interest for me  The Café has always offered a variety to cover those needs. If you have any questions about the validity of these meetings and the priceless opportunity of networking with agencies and other parents, please contact me.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Gov. Bush, I felt I needed to help my neighbors. I live in Boynton 
Beach, The Verona Lakes development. Our townhome insurance got dropped. 
It was picked up by Citizens Insurance. The premium went from $100,000.00 
to $700,000.00. Each town home owner is getting a $3000.00 assessment and 
their monthly homeowners fee will also be dramatically increased. Many can 
not afford this. Many will try to sell,which is hard to do these days. 
Many will be foreclosed by the Homeowners association or the mortgage 
company. All I know is that people work very hard and some live from 
paycheck to paycheck. The insurance industry is ruining our freedom to own 
homes.I feel like we are being punished for living in Florida. I know 
other states have their problems( I'm from NJ) but this is getting way out 
of hand. I never write letters of disapproval,but I needed to do this. I 
wrote your brother also. I love Florida and it is such a shame that this 
is happening. I hope that something can be done about this problem. I wish 
I could help. I'm sure that you read many letters about this same 
subject,and I'm sorry that I needed to do so. I am a Life lone Republican. 
I think I have voted for everyone in your family.I hope that insurance can 
return to an affordable part of homeownership. Thank You so much for 
reading this.  Jill Wiser

Sincerely,


Jill Wiser

Subject:	Real Estate Taxes

 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am 51 years old, my husband will soon be 60.  We are preparing for our retirement, yet after receiving our proposed real estate taxes, I am dishearten.  
 
We bought a  1988 2 bedroom/2 bath trailer on 2 acres in Cue Lake Hills on Cue Lake, Putnam County 3 years ago for our retirement. It is a place where I dream of living the rest of my years with my husband.   In the mean time  we made the sacrifice to pay it off instead of buying other things, and use it as our vacation retreat.     We thought it would be an easy little place to care for and at only 1000 SQ FT it is.  We paid only $90,000.  The taxes have gone up  from $800, $1200, $1600 and this year are proposed to go up to $2500.  I fear I will not be able to afford this little place for our retirement.   With Social Security, I know I won't be able to afford this.
 
My dreams are shattered.  How can I protect myself from a 400% increase.  No one has a salary increase of such!
 
I'm not asking for a homestead deduction, I agree I do not deserve to have the deduction since I have a deduction already, but I am asking for the legislature to protect our future retirement by protecting the taxes from skyrocket due to the sales.  And I agree that if I buy property as an investment, this is all part of the cost of investing in real estate.  I am asking for the you to look into protecting one other property.
 
Perhaps the legislature could look into protecting ONE other property, from tax hike such as homestead does, without receiving the $25000 deduction, which is equivalent to $500.  This could easily be controlled in the same manner the Homestead exemption is being controlled by property appraisers.  It would also increase real estate sales, which in this market could use a boost.  
 
Please help protect our retirement dreams by protecting our property taxes on one other real estate. 
 
I look forward to hear from you.

Subject:	"CITIZENS" Insurance

  
Citizens Insurance Property Corp, "CITIZENS", was a bad idea in 2003 and is now a terrible mistake.    
I have read that in 2004 "CITIZENS" collected roughly $ 1.4 billion in premiums and millions of tax dollars. I researched "CITIZENS" financial statement to determine total income vs claim payments. I conclude that only a CPA could fathom "CITIZENS" complicated financial statement.
It may be more cost effective to put "CITIZENS" assets in an interest bearing account. Forget about Reinsurers, etc, etc, simply pay claims out of the account.
"CITIZENS" is now the largest Wind Storm insurer in Florida. Insurance companies are canceling policies that are then covered by "CITIZENS" at a higher premium.
"CITIZENS" should be phased out by regulations that require Insurance Companies to write policies for every type in their inventory. Write all types, or not do business in Florida.
Florida taxpayers should not be in the Insurance business. Personally, I am paying for "CITIZENS" with tax dollars, plus a       $ 104 surcharge on my Homeowners premium.
Government should set the rules/ regulations, then get out of the way & not create another Bureaucracy.

Subject:	Insurance Increase for Elderly Mom

Dear Governor,
My mother who will be turning 76 years old has just had her house insurance increase to over $2600.00.  My father died last year, she is in a wheel chair with Diabetes and cannot walk from a knee surgery that did not help her knee.  I cannot believe that she has to come up with this amount of money.  She lives on social security and cannot afford this.  She lives in the home she bought with my dad when they moved down to Florida in 1966.  They had 5 children in this house. I am trying to have her move up by me in northern Florida but she insists on living where she brought up her children and had so many fond family memories. She was paying last year $3,000.00 and now she has to pay $5,600.00. How is she to do this?  The fee for her house for the age was $27.00 it went up to $800.00 - that is an unbelievable increase that her agent says the state of Florida approved.  Her house was built in 1952 she thinks and it is a solid cement clock house.  My Dad's brother from Minnesota bought my mom Storm shutters for the house so it is really secure. Please tell me this is a mistake for Senior Citizens to have to pay for this.
 
Her name is Gloria Pierson
She lives in Miami Springs
Her phone number is 305-887-8593

Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,

 

My wife and I moved to Pasco County, Florida 4 years ago, but we have been visiting since 1980.  When we first moved here and went through Hurricanes Charley, Francis, and Jeannie you portrayed a genuine concern.  Since then, it seems the politicians work for the insurance companies and not their constituents.  An article in today’s newspaper says that it would be unconstitutional for the politicians to force companies to write insurance.  Other States ruled that cherry picking practices are discriminatory.  California requires them to write 45% homeowners insurance.

 

It seems good when you’re on TV after a storm, but now when something must be done, you put the "fox in charge of the hen house" with your appointed committee comprised of insurance people.

 

The company I retired from designs and builds car and truck frames.  We designed a small volume frame which we did not want to build.  We had no choice or we would not have all their other business.  Who accounts for the percentage of money that leaves Florida for the companies corporate offices that does not come back to help share the risk and is retained as profit.

 

Also at the lack of progress politicians are making, it seems this is not important enough to them, but I would like to see how many get re-elected when a lot of people start losing their homes.

 

On the front page of the St. Pete Times today there was an article about a man that spent $5,000+ for storm shutters and to have his garage door reinforced.  State Farm Insurance only gave him a $16.11 rebate.  That hardly compensates for the investment.  Is the new Matching Funds Program going to be worth the investment?

Dear Governor:
Let's get down to business. Stop the hurricane insurance hikes by putting a cap. Example:I just paid $3,500.00 for my insurance. The cap for my insurance should not go over $4,000.00 in two or three years. Florida does not have the strong economy to pay the insurance companies the little or no raise that we can get every year or two. Floridians are not going to pay the little raise into insurance coverage that is out of control. Floridians will be forced to sell their houses and move to other states. You, Mr. Bush, put a cap, like the ones in sports, salary cap, in this case insurance cap, so that Floridians have time, money , and the resources to be able to afford it.
Think about it, and let me know,
Thanks,
Jose

Subject:	Homeowners Insurance cancelled

Governor Bush,
 
My  homeowner's insurance company, American Strategic Insurance located in St. Petersburg,  refuses to renew my home owners insurance due to "reduction in Catastrophe Exposure".  I have never filed a claim with this company though I have paid them for a number of years.  The local insurance broker is trying to locate another company who will insure in Florida.  Why is a company located in Florida, not willing to do business in Florida?
 
As a life long Florida resident, I would like to know how insurance companies can take a consumer's money for years with no claims and then just decide not to renew.  What are my options?

Aug.16, 2006

 

 

 

Dear Gov. Bush:

 

 

I am shocked and amazed at how State Farm Insurance got a 53% increase in homeowners insurance.

 

How can the Office of Insurance Regulation authorize a 53% increase?  We, the people if we are lucky only get a 3% increase.  Which won’t help us with our insurance premiums.

 

I just don’t get it?  What has State Farm done with all the past premiums over the past several years, which they didn’t have to pay out?  And I know it was bad year in 2004.  But for a company that post profits for the end of the year, which is good for company and shareholders. How do they justify an increase of this amount?  They Can’t!!!!!

 

 

I was raised in Florida (from age 6wks old) I attended school, worked, raised a family.  I lost my husband to Agent Orange Cancer 2 years ago.  We worked hard for the place that we owned and now because of such a huge increase I know I will have to sell out and leave Florida.

 

 

Well, I’m sorry that is not good enough.

 

 

What about the average working class person.  Who by the way just do get by barely.  Or the lower income that really just can’t for the price of living has become such a huge issue that no one seems willing to address except where it is going to make your pockets bigger.  (And I am talking in general terms when I say yours).  

 

Yes, I am aware of how powerful the insurance Lobbyist is.  I really think that its time for the people to rise up and speak.  No more lining pockets with money, gifts, trips…..You work for the people of Florida as do the rest of the Officials that we elect to serve us.   But you know politics smile out one end and stab with the other!!!!

 

 

People are fed up with the way things are going.  The officials better be thinking of the little man for once.  If you don’t I will tell you what is going to happen.  It might take a few short years but it is coming.

 

Who will work the Wal-Marts, Disney, Busch Gardens, restaurants? And the other entire tourist related jobs? You? I doubt that very seriously.  Our elected Officials, doubt that too.

Besides if they from the US Senate on down the line to State Representatives had to survive on what the average person in this state had to, they wouldn’t last 6 months or less. 

And the people from up North who sells their homes and move to Florida pays cash for their homes and plays golf all day they aren’t going to do it either. That I can promise you.

 

So where does that leave the average American Floridian who has helped build this state with our time, taxes and probably a lot more?  Out in the cold is where it is going to leave them. Wondering where they are going to live, which state can they move to that is going to make it better for them?  See not everyone wants a government hand out.  They want to work, live and be happy in a state that offers them something other than high crime.  But if you as Governor of Florida allow this to happen without doing something before your time in office is over, well I afraid the people of Florida may have something to say negative about that.

If you have any Political looks beyond the Governor’s Office then you really need to look into this.  Every election is by vote except for the presidential race.  Which should be done like any other election.

 

People are ready to vote everyone that comes up for re-election out instead of in.  Just pick up the paper read the opinion section of the paper.  There were 4 people today in the Florida Today Opinion Section.  Please remember these people also have friends that vote. Once word really starts to spread you are going to be face with some angry voters whether you are Republican or Democrat. 

 

I will be contacting all of my friends and relatives through out Florida so they before aware of this situation.

 

Please look into this problem that should never have been passed in the first place.

 

I feel the same way as John Whalen of Suntree who keeps up on the news and attended 2 insurance seminars this summer this calls out to be investigated.

And is it true that $19 million in lobby funds have been contributed to the benefit of legislators and state officials, who were the recipients and in what amounts?  How much was received by CFO Gallagher?

 Mr Bush it has become too expensive to live in south Florida .I came here from New York 3 years ago and I am going back as soon as I can sell my house. The problem is no one wants it .Taxes , insurance,electric have become too much of a burden. At least in New York we can make enough to pay the higher living expense. We own our own business and our electric bill went from $1200.00 a month to $1840.00.The hurricanes have become an excuse for F.P.l to squeeze the life from everyone.If we decided to buy a bigger home and stay our taxes would be higher then they were in New York. Our insurance company has just told us they are cancelling our policy.There was a time when it seemed everyone was planning on coming to Florida, now it seems everyone can't wait to leave .

I would think with the huge amount of money the government...local...state...federal collects, there should be help with home owners and the poor insurance options here.

 

I can just see the future. Mobile/Manufactured home parks will become blighted across Florida and the cause, lack of government help. I just can not see sticking money into a home in one of these parks with little or no house insurance.

 

I still think since my family invested in a house insurance company here in Florida for 30 years with no claims and then we get dropped, the company should be penilized some how.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I just received my proposed property tax bill. I just purchased a house in Pinellas County, and am now being punished for it. Every time someone buys a property, they experience property tax creep. My taxes went up by 5 times what I was paying in Hillsborough County for a like property, and over doubled from last year.

 

When are you going to lower the millage rates, or increase the Homestead Exemption? These inflated taxes are crippling the real estate market, and are not equitable. My neighbor pays a fraction of taxes compared to my taxes, simply because they have lived there longer. These taxes hinder new real estate purchases, hurt commerce, hurt new home buyers, and are inequitable.

I am a Sarasota Florida resident who has lived here since I was 8 yrs old.  I am soon to be 55 and I am totally disgusted.  I was planning on living in my home for the rest of my life.   I now am being forced from the only thing I have left to hang on to-my precious property.  My insurance was $686.00 a year 2 years ago.

Subject:	Harden Our Homes

Dear Governor:
   Watched the Cabinet meeting last night on Tv. It was like watching a bunch of Oprah clones; the phony enthusiasm over a program that only your wealthy cohorts will be able to milk was disgusting. It was ironic when high paid state employee Lisa Miller said, while presenting the program, that she was ready to sign up. Oh yes, the rest of us will be taken care of, because: 
   1] The low income individual may get county assistance with the cost. Low income people don't own homes.
   2] Those of  average income, who can't pay their mortgage and the exhorbitant homeowner's insurance premiums, may get low interest loans from banks. They are so strapped now they have trouble rubbing two dimes together, but you and your cabinet members expect them to take on more debt.
   Take a look at the front page of today's St Petersburg Times and you'll see a sample of the savings in insurance premiums that will be realized if we "harden our homes". The individual who took it upon himself to harden his home before the harden your home program is effective saved $16.11 off his premium. 
   Wake up Governor! Try applying some common sense before thousands more Floridians are ruined by your feeble efforts to solve the disaster, a disaster that as everyday passes appears to be far above your abilities.
   There is only one viable answer and that is a State Catastrophe Property Insurance Program with a single per $1,000 per value insured applicable throughout the entire state. Stop dreaming that the "reinsurance gnomes of Zurich will return". That's a pipe dream, and Governors shouldn't opperate on pipe dreams.
   I know you won't see this, but maybe it will wake someone on your staff up.
   Sincerely, Michael Fitzpatrick, a Republican for 50+ years

Honorable Madam Jennings, er … Lt Gov;

 

            Thought I’d enter the fray on Insurance reform:

 

            1)  These folks are in business to make money –

            bad business decisions by them are not the

            responsibility of the State.

 

            2)  They speak of re-insurance.  That means hedging

            their bets.  And, who picks up the premium on this

            hedge?  Policy holders;  what a concept!  I’d go

            along with that, providing they reward me with big

            discounts for not making a claim each year.  Oh, by

            the way; 19 years and NO claim to my carrier.  I

            guess I’m a useful idiot – huh?  Yep, no discount

            since I entered into their “coverage.”  And, now it’s

            going up 38% in October…. Farm Bureau.

 

            3)  I know your record – it’s good to great!  Therefore,

            I’ll look forward to your chairing this inaugural reform 

            meeting.  Should be very interesting.  I bid you much

            good fortune.

To the Honorable Toni Jennings, Lt. Governor
 
Today I am writing concerning the 90% proposed budget cut for the Family Cafe's Annual Governor's Summit on Disabilities and Conference.  I was going to begin by reviewing the agenda's of these meetings and specifically telling you the workshops and contacts I have made while attending these meetings.  But it is my hope that before you made such a drastic decision, that you would on your own take a closer look at what such a cut would do to this organization and all the people that it touches. Nearly 10,000 individuals attended this year's meeting alone.  This venue  needs expanding, not cut! 
 
    I have ask the Family Cafe to send you back issues of the meeting agendas.  Please imagine yourself as an adult with disabilities or the caregiver of a loved one or  the parent of a child or adult who is severely disabled as you review them.  Even with your position in our government, as an individual where would you begin to find the services that you need?
 
     I attended every workshop on the IDEA and IEP's that I could find locally, but I didn't really learn how to help my son until I attended a Family Cafe's Conference.  Now my son is 20, we have issues of housing, transportation, the legal system, relationships, independence vs. guardianships options, additional medical needs and supported employment, and much more as he ages.  I have obtained information, had questions answered and made contacts at these conferences that I truly would not have gotten anywhere else. 
 
    As a member of several local organizations for the disabled, I share the information that I obtain because they do not have such contacts and resources.  I have obtained information for my son's medical staff as they are interested in having such resources for other patients.   It just isn't out there any where else. This is an opportunity to meet with representatives of many organization, vendors and other parents to get the solutions we so desperately need.  It is a weekend packed with so much vital information that you wish it would last a week.  I return home with a notepad of information and literally 3 or 4 bags of information to read and it is all relevant. 
 
   My son like many disabled individuals does not have a case worker, I am his case worker.  My mother is my 40 year old brother's case manager.  We have to find and do and follow-up on everything.  Services for the disabled are shamefully scare in our state.  Proper support services for mentally ill are even harder to find. Too many budgets have already been cut.  Often disabled citizens are left to fend for themselves.  Navigating these systems are difficult for even able-bodied people.  But we do not give up, we learn, we learn what is out there and what isn't  and we learn to do things for ourselves.  The Family Cafe's Conference has been  instrumental in the success of so many disabled individuals as well as families.  I know it has been influential in son's progress and my ability to guide him to independence. 
 
   I urge you to continue supporting the Family Cafe's Conference and not to cut the budget any further. It isn't like days of old when we were locked away out of sight.  More and more individuals are becoming disabled and babies are being born with disabilities.  You can't ignore them, you can't allow further budget cuts,  they are not going away. And we do not deserve to have this vital networking opportunity taken away from us by our government. 
 
   Families are fighting battles within the walls of their homes to care for their loves ones, becoming financially and spiritually broke seeking services and answers to the many questions and needs.  Please continue to budget this service, so they we learn to help them and help others along with way.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I have lived in Lee County all my life, as have my parents.  In 1994 I purchased a new home for less than sixty-five thousand dollars and my Homestead Exemption was twenty-five thousand dollars.  Now a new home will cost a person in the excess of 200,000 dollars and the exemption has remained the same.  The tax burden on new home buyers has severely limited the dream of owning your own home.  Is there any considerations being made to increase the Homestead Exemption?

I had previously sent you an email regarding my profound concern of homeowner insurance for Floridians. I was so hoping to hear back from you, that I am writing again asking you to please respond. I understand your position as busy as you are, but people are being dropped everyday from their insurance programs with no means of getting insurance or even paying the extremely high premiums that Citizens Insurance company is offering. They are the ONLY insurance company writing at this time.

 

Please help us keep our homes.

 

I am anxiously awaiting your response. I hope the Task Force is on track to a better solution for our State.

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings,
     I am a citizen of Cantonment, Florida, and a registered voter.  I am writing to you about the Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee.  In 2004 Hurricane Ivan devastated the area I live in.  The State of Florida and Gulf Power did a wonderful job making sure the people of the area had food, water, and making sure the power was quickly restored.  My family was personally very lucky, we had minimal damage and never even had to file an insurance claim.  
     The problems begin after the hurricane.  In 2004 our insurance premium was $687.00 per year.  This year our premium is $2,267.00.  My husband and I own our home, and have a moderate mortgage.  We are a low-income family, making approximately $21,000 per year for a 3 person family.  This brings our homeowner insurance to 10.9% of our income.  Couple this with raising gas prices, higher property taxes, and overall inflation and we are in serious danger of losing our home.
     I recently read a proposal put forth online by a group called Americans for Insurance Reform.  Their plan suggests taking hurricane coverage out of the hands of the private insurance sector, as was done with the National Flood Insurance Program.  I am not well informed about the possible solutions to the problems with homeowner insurance, but this possibility has a certain appeal to me.    
     The stories I have heard about denied claims scare me.  People have lost their homes and their belongings.  Many of these people paid premiums to the insurance companies believing that this would protect them.  Only to find that the insurance companies are more concerned with profits than with the needs of their clients.
     I beg you as a human, a citizen and a voter to please consider the lives and interests of all of Florida's citizens.  I realize that you are a very busy person, and that there are many aspects of this problem that make it very difficult not only for policy holders, but policy carriers.  Insurance companies are refusing to write policies, denying claims, and doing their best to mitigate their losses.  We need someone to stand up for the citizens.  
     Thank you for your time and your commitment to solving this horrible problem in the State of Florida.

when i contacted the insurance company and tried to get minimum coverage they raised it to 2700.00 and the bank is going to charge 5400.00 to 8100.00 a year at what point will this madness stop , i have until October before we loose our home. how and why can they charge whatever they want in my opinion this is nothing but blackmail.

Dear Gov. Jeb Bush,
I tried to file on line, but one of the requirements to get assistance is Proof of Home Owner's Insurance.
I lost mine, that was through Clariden Select, Tower Hill, calling in on Monday morning, being 8 hours too late to make a credit card payment, they canceled me. The quarterly payment made before on credit card, I was told to call in the next day, in order for them to accept it, I did ask for another phone number that would except my payment, I knew that would be their way out.....They got me!
I couldn't call on a Sunday, Monday was too late. I couldn't afford it, already my credit card was soaring, with Insurance premiums and costs to repair our home hit by Frances, Jeanne and Wilma.
I can not afford Citizens Insurance, high premium with a 5% deductible is ridiculous! Double what I was already paying.....So we sit bare this season.
I don't know where to turn. There are so many other working class here in Palm Beach County, that can't afford Insurance on our homes.
This is our investment, our home is paid for. We live on a single income, I can't work with neck injury.
To live here and work all our lives to keep our little piece of paradise, is now becoming a nightmare of worry.

Subject:	"Save Our Homes" situation


Dear Gov. Bush:

I'm writing in favor of either the repeal or substantial re-write of the
so-called Save Our Homes amendment. I'm a 56 year old, native white collar
Floridian from a blue collar upbringing who has worked very hard to
"trade-up" over the years to a nice home here in New Smyrna Beach.
Ironically, my neighbors who moved here to retire from other states and
have contributed little to Florida via taxes or hard work, pay less than
1/2 of the $6500+ in property taxes that I pay. Newer neighbors are saddled
with property taxes in the $10K-$12K and up range despite all of our homes
and "fair market values" being very similar. It shouldn't be this way as
it's killing the real estate market (it's not really the rising interest
rates - it's the growing realization of what happens to your property taxes
when you move!!!) and prohibiting older "empty-nesters" like me from
downsizing to a smaller, less expensive home. I've done the calculations
and, even if my home were many thousands lower in value, my taxes would go
up to $8k or more. That's nearly $700 per month that I would have to budget
for property taxes in my retirement years - not what one would want or
could afford to do unless very wealthy and certainly not "saving my home"!
For those of us who have moved or built a new one since the amendment was
implemented, it has created an unbelievable inequity in how we are taxed.
Note that my wife and I, both professionals, will be moving out of our home
state of Florida upon retirement in order to maintain the lifestyle we
would like to live as we cannot afford to retire here if "Save Our Homes"
stays in-place as currently written. In addition, my son, a 28 year old Air
Force Captain and F-16 fighter pilot, has already told me that he will
never come back to Florida to live as he cannot afford the property taxes
here which are higher than any other state in the US that he's been
stationed at - a sad comment for a father to hear.

Please pass my perspective on this subject to your committee now studying
the amendment. The State must do the right thing and tax all who live here
equitably. Even if my taxes increase (they shouldn't if Volusia County
government would follow private enterprise's lead and operate in a leaner
mode), at least it will be equitable.

Subject:	Insurance Rates for Master Condo Policies

Hon. Jeb Bush, et al:
I believe it is time for some drastic action in the area of control over the rates charged for Master Condo Insurance Policies in the State of Florida.  The Citizens' Insurance Group was never intended to be the only insurer for Condominiums, and certainly should not be such.  This year, our Master Condo Policy Premium went from $14,117.00+ to $100,915.00, primarily because we were non-renewed by Nationwide and could  not obtain insurance from any source except the 
Citizens' Group.  That should not be possible in this State.

Subject:	taxes towards college tuition!

Dear Governor Bush, 
          
 My name is Jenny Rothman and I am a student at Hillsborough Community College. Neither of my parent finished college, so it's very important to them and myself that I get my degree. I am currently working two jobs to put myself through college. I know I am only a small voice but I think that's it's very important to me to write to you and inform you that I am one of many college student that faces a problem like this. I just wanted to see if in the next election maybe you could push for some of our tax dollars to go towards supporting college tuition. It's so important know days to become anything in this world, you must have a degree. But also now days it's more expensive and now a lot harder in some cases to get into certain colleges. Working two jobs makes it harder for me as a student to not only focus but make it to all of my classes, if there was some way for my college to get paid for without having to pay it back I would only have to work one job. Of course I could get scholarships but you have to have really good grades for that and working to jobs, my grades are only good enough to pass. So as anyone could see it's a viscous cycle. If there was some of the money for taxes that went towards education, a lot more people would go to school and become educated. I'm not asking for a drastic change over night, because I know that is impossible. All I ask of you after reading this letter is that you take it into consideration and keep all of the college students in the back of your mind.
                         Thank you for your time,

And if that's not bad enough, we're told that it will go up an additional $96,000 next year! If you didn't know that it's this bad, you need to take a good look! And, if this is wrong, PLEASE GET BACK TO ME AND LET ME KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL!
 
We have no other insurance option, I'm told. How can this be? If you have a mortgage (like everyone does) you need insurance....never mind protecting everything you own.
 
The claims we put in from Wilma were not paid, as the deductible is so high, so we never even had a claim with this company and we had to put additional "out-of-pocket" money to get things fixed (which still aren't, by the way). 
 
Any other business would be regulated, mandated, ridiculed or turned over to the courts.  How can you allow this to happen to the common, everyday person. We can't afford this!!! This is so wrong and it's bringing such hardships on us. This is true corruption. There's a lot of angry people out here and it's only a matter of time 'til our voices get heard and our votes are cast. 
 
Is there anything you can do to help?  We are all getting very desperate just trying to live our lives without worrying about losing our homes because we can't pay these absurd Insurance Premiums.
 
Thank you for you time and consideration.
 
Most Sincerely,
Julie Calandriello

I have always voted Republican in Federal and State elections .  I am a life-long resident of Florida.  I own a home and am having to contemplate selling out and moving.  Republicans are ignoring the home insurance crisis in Florida.  I can't take another 40 or 50 % rate hike.   Retired couples are being forced out because of the crisis and there is a lack of leadership in dealing with the problem.  The outrage is going to have far-reaching consequences for the Republican Party in Florida.  If the Democrats are willing to help me keep my home then I'm willing to listen to them.  This is not politics as usual.  We are losing our homes while Republicans we put in office are standing idly by with now answer.    William R. Dalton  1919 Melissa Oaks Dr.  Gulf Breeze Fl 32563

Subject:	200% insurance hike

Dear Gov, Bush,
 
Today I received an insurance quote from my current insurance carrier. The new quote offered to me for home owner's insurance, for this next year, was greater than 200% higher than this previous year.
 
I am a Registered Nurse and would be forced, without option, to sale my home and leave the state of Florida if this is not remedied.
I make a respectable salary and to be forced to choose between insurance and some of the "comforts of life" is entirely unfair.
 
This atrocity enforced upon the young residents of Florida will surely only beget the exodus of this age group. This age group has seen a great increase in population over the last few years and to lose this tax base would be unfortunate.
 
My personal insurance increased from 2400.00 (year 2006) to 7962 for this next year. Sadly, I may not be here to pay any future bills due to the fact I have been forced to leave.
 
I love everything about being in Florida and love serving the residents of Pinellas County as an RN. I would hate to leave. Could you please offer me any assistance?
 
Thank you so much,
Sincerely,

Subject:	RE: HELP SAVE THE FAMILY CAFE ANNUAL CONFERENCE

 I would just like to say that I am not happy about the cut Family café has
occurred however I do agree.
My reason is not only do they receive funding from the government but it was
875.00 for a vendor to have a table. Plus whatever was donated. I believe
that events like this should only be able to use funding for Child care
providers and maybe travel arrangement for people who qualify. I believe the
rest of the money should come through donations and fundraisers. I believe
the family café is amazing for families and political parties. I believe
having you there made a statement of care. I Believe a state conference
needs to continue on an annual basis but I believe the money does have to
watched and monotortered very closely. Do you know Lunch was not even
provided for families? If you take a look at the Family Network on
Disabilities state conference this Saturday this was by donations from
people from across Florida. I am telling you that from a political view it
would be great for you or your running partner to keep at least an annual
appearance for our families but I do agree Conferences like this should only
need a jump start budget and then work for the donation's or fundraisers.
There are a lot of organizations that provide training all year long to
families. What Family Café did was bring you to the table and that is what
made a difference in people heart. I want to thank you from the bottom of my
heart for being there and I hope maybe this pans out to be able to continue
to hear of the success that you share,  budget announcements etc. Please
keep this between us because I do work in the realm of all this but I wanted
to share my opinion and my gratitude of thanks. By the way If you would like
to brainstorm about an annual conference sometime just let me know!!!!

Subject: HELP SAVE THE FAMILY CAFE ANNUAL CONFERENCE


Dear Friends,

The Family Café began with a simple dream: educating and empowering people
with disabilities and their families, so they could participate fully in
society. 

Thanks to much hard work, and the financial support of the State of Florida,
that dream has become a reality. The Family Café Annual Conference has grown
from a simple vision to become the largest, most successful statewide
conference of its kind in the nation, hosting over 10,000 individuals this
past June. 

Sadly, THAT DREAM IS NOW IN JEOPARDY. 

The State of Florida has informed The Family Café that THE BUDGET FOR THE
ANNUAL CONFERENCE WILL BE CUT BY 90%! 

This puts the entire Annual Conference in danger of being CANCELLED!

We believe that THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, and we believe you will feel the same
way. 

Informed families make better decisions and build effective partnerships
that improve outcomes for children and adults with disabilities. Floridians
with disabilities deserve a forum for education and networking; they
certainly DO NOT deserve to have such an essential resource as The Family
Café Annual Conference taken away by their state government. 

Our event has provided great benefit to thousands of Florida’s families, and
will continue to do so in the future, WITH YOUR HELP! HERE’S WHAT YOU CAN
DO:

1.	Contact Agency for Persons with Disabilities Director Shelly
Brantley at (850) 488-1558 or shelly.brantley@apd.state.fl.us. Let her know
how much The Family Café Annual Conference has meant to you and your family.
Ask her to submit a Budget Amendment Request to the Florida Legislature to
fully fund the Annual Conference immediately. 

2.	Contact your State Legislators in the House and Senate. (To find
your State Senator online, visit www.flsenate.gov and enter your zip code.
To find your State Representative, visit
http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Representatives/myrepresentative.aspx
and enter your zip code.) Tell them how much the Annual Conference means to
you, and ask them to fully restore its funding immediately. 

3.	Contact Senator Lisa Carlton, Chair of the Senate Ways and Means
Committee, at (941) 486-2032 or carlton.lisa.web@flsenate.gov, and
Representative Joe Negron, Chair of the House Fiscal Council at (772)
221-4904 or cheri.vancura@myfloridahouse.gov. These two Legislators lead the
committees that make budget decisions. They need to know about The Family
Café Annual Conference, and how essential it is to keep its funding intact. 

4.	Let us know what action you have taken, either by e-mail to
lfahey@familycafe.net or by calling our office at 1-888-309-CAFÉ (2233). 

This is a CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE FAMILY CAFÉ. Will the dream die, or will
it be sustained? WE MUST ACT NOW! This is the time to advocate for
ourselves, to make our voices heard. Please take action immediately, and
continue to call, e-mail and write between now and August 28th. For you
family, your community, and for all of the Floridians that will benefit from
the Annual Conference in future years, please SPEAK OUT TO SAVE THE FAMILY
CAFÉ ANNUAL CONFERENCE TODAY! 

Thank you,
The Family Café

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As you know a great many Floridians are facing a financial crisis when it comes to home owners insurance. My own just went up $300.00 a month because we were dropped and then picked up by Citizens. We are not in a flood zone or ever had a claim. We are not people of great means and this putting a tremendous strain on our ability to pay our mortgage. As a supporter of both you and your brother I hope you will have a solution to this problem soon.

Jeb, I've written more than once to you regarding the
real estate taxes and the crisis in the homeowner's
insurance.  Regarding the real estate taxes, why
don't you give senior citizens, 65 yrs and older a
$50,000 homestead exemption.  This is imperative
because many cannot afford these taxes anymore.
Florida is getting very expensive to live here and if
I could, I would move out immediately.
The $25,000 HX is "PEANUTS, IT MEANS NOTHING"!!
I'm also writing Charlie Crist.  
You people sit in your big leather chairs but when
a voter puts thoughts into your brains, you don't act.
We need this homestead exemption for 65 yrs and older.
It's too bad that this petition didn't pass when someone
tried to put it thru for referendum...it didn't go thru,
although I signed for it.
It's so damn sad that you don't take the time to answer
any of my emails and I don't mean one of your aides
to do the sending.

I have called Mike Fasanos office who directed me call your Office who directed me to Chief Gallaghers offfce who directed me to call Mike Fasanos office.  The  fact remains that we as a business and personally have watched a hemmorhage of finances just to cover insurance and we are not even given a choice of which company to use.

Subject:	Home Ownership in the Sunshine State

 I just got an e-mail from a friend about a program to receive a grant to make hurricane improvements on my home. First of all I had not heard of this program and secondly my insurance company notified me that they would no longer write policies in the state of florida about 3 months ago. Thus began the process of calling around to find a new policy. We found out that several companies would not insure us because of the age of our home. We found a company that gave us a quote that was good for thirty days and there had to be a four point home inspection. The results of the inspection were that the roof had to be replaced, breaker box had to be upgraded, total- close to $16,000 dollars. Now on to getting quotes from roofers and scheduling the repairs, oh and not to mention the fact that no longer are we paying $700.00 dollars a year for insurance, but it is going to be closer to triple that amount. So I call My Safe Florida Home and I am told I don't qualify for the grant because we have already paid for an inspection and hired a contractor and the state has its own. To make a long story short, if we had registered for the program the likelyhood of getting it all acomplished by September 6 (insurance policy lapses) would probably would have resulted in our home being foreclosed on. The government of Florida has got to do better. A six month notice would have been nice. Oh and by the way the smug attitude of state employees is unreal in phone conversations with the very people who pay your salaries. You know it would have been nice to get some help with this without having to devastate our savings and max out our credit.
 
Sincerely yours,
Victoria Abrams

Subject:	Insurance Crisis and Solution

Dear Governor Bush;

 As you know Florida is in a severe state of crisis with the insurance industry, both commercial and private property policies are out of control. Many insurance companies are pulling out because they can’t get insurance themselves. Citizen’s is out of control because of poor administration and to much overhead.

 I have got a relatively simple solution. Every homeowner and co-worker I have talked with agrees my idea is an easy solution; it crosses all barriers, helps the retirees & elderly, and shares the burden equally. I have talked this over with many and they said to send it to you, here it is.

*	Unpopular 2-3% employment tax, unpopular until we reap the following benefits.
*	Designate this money solely for storm recovery, not mitigation before hand.
*	The amount of $’s available from this would be staggering, at even 3% the money would be easier to swallow bi-monthly than a 40-60-80% jump in premiums. A 3% paycheck cut is easy to maintain.
*	Everyone shares equally, even renters, as their money would help the commercial funding, except the elderly-who have paid their dues over time, and should not have to live in fear of no home, or no insurance. They must be 72 have lived here for as a full time resident for the previous 2-3 years and can prove it with the homestead exemptions.
*	This fund must be administered by the judicial branch to prevent fraud and to eliminate the middle-man profit taking.
*	In order to process a claim, you must show your previous year tax records, for at least 1 year, and if you are not in the system as a taxpayer you can be charged with fraudulent claims and then income tax evasion, this eliminates the “illegals” from the “free-money pot”.

I had homeowners insurance with Poe. I knew, I was going to be cancelled, and put under Citizens insurance, in October of this year. I found insurance with Nation Wide in June. I cancelled my insurance with Poe/Citizens. I received my refund. The only thing, I am upset about, They kept a $100.00 of my refund, and now I have to pay them 2% at the end of the year as all homeowners do. I'm being double charged by the State ran insurance company. I think this is very shady. They are cheating people left and right. I'd like to now why they are getting away with this. Can your office check into this. It's not so much the money it's the principal of the whole thing. My home address 10330 Tarragon Drive. Riverview, Florida 33569. Thanking You in advance.

Dear Sir:
           I am the president of a small condominium association who recently received a call from our State Farm Insurance agent who stated that our hurricane insurance would not be renewed in January 2007. It appears that our only option will be the state sponsored Citizens Insurance known as the insurance of last resort. That of course means at the highest cost. We could be put in a position of not being able to sell and even lose our inside coverage. I read where the legislature does not expect to address insurance until next year. We are between a rock and a hard place since we won't be able to sell and if we get insurance the cost will be extreme. I realize the end of your term is near and I have been so impressed with what you have done for our state that I am hoping you can do one more great thing for all condo associations across Florida.

Subject:	[*] Hurricane Home Owner's Insurance.

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:

I am writing to you for your help and understanding.  I am a 100% Service Connected Disabled Veteran.  I get a small pension from the State of Florida, Department of Correction, and my V.A. pension.  Recently I received a letter from my Home owner's Insurance Company, U.S.A.A.  The letter advised me of changes in my Home Owner's Insurance.

A couple days later I received the copy of my tentative new Insurance Plan.  It referred to the Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation deficit for 2004 hurricane season.  It then goes on to say the assessment changes are reflected on my Declarations page.  It also mentions Hurricane Premiums including FHCF.

When I saw the premiums my insurance nearly tripled.  How can someone on a fixed income afford a mortgage payment that rises from approximately $700.00 per month to nearly $900.00 per month.  That is just our main home.  our other home where my son and grandchildren live goes from $550.00 per month to almost $730.00 per month.  Our son can only afford the basic mortgage payment we pay the taxes and insurance so our grandchildren have a roof over their head.  His finance is expecting another child in November and is on no work orders from the doctor.  He is the sole bread winner.

I voted Republican and also helped at the headquarters during the 2000 and 2004 elections for your brother and your campaigns plus other Republican Senators and House Representatives.  Since 2000 I have see the Department of Correction go severely down hill!  State Government has become incompetent and rude.  Just try to get Medicaid and you'll see what I mean.  My three grandchildren were on and off more times than a wall switch to a light bulb.  When they asked for proof of employment how many times do you think my son had to provide it?  If you said 3 your too low try a minimum of 6 times and my wife faxed some and he hand delivered some and I did personally too.

Now our House and Senate vote on something that will cause many people to have to sell their homes or go bankrupt because they can't afford the mortgage payments any more.  Why?  How much did the Insurance Industry Lobby pay our Representatives to sell us out?  I can't even afford to upgrade my home to standard for hurricanes.  It was built in sections starting in 1974.  I purchased it in 2004.

I hope you realize how many people this insurance law will throw out of their homes or force to sign the waiver and refuse the insurance altogether.  I probably will.  I sank ALL my money into the down payment for an investment never think my government would cut my knees out from underneath me!

What is all this for and, why is it happening?  Is this the new means test for home owners?  Weed out the undesirables from the state?  I'll tell you this, I'll not vote for another Republican again in this state!  All they do is say they are cutting taxes; which, is a bunch of malarkey's.  Our taxes have not gone down we still pay the same if not more.  All that has happen is government employees lost their jobs to save money and a great deal of the work was contracted out with a lower standard and lesser result.  You even are cutting back on peoples mental health on Medicare.  Some bean counter is going to tell a professional counselor  how many hours it should take to cure someone of a certain illness.  What a bunch of horse manure! 

Any way to cut corners so long as the majority of the public think it going alright then all is fine.  Well this State is so close to melt down and either you can't see it or you don't care to see it!  I hope I'm wrong but, I don't think I am.  At least everything I can see and everything that I have experienced and read proves me right.

William H. Squire, III

Governor Bush, 
 
I see that the state is now offering Hurricane grants for people to prepare their homes against hurricane damage.   I think it is a wonderful idea.   In fact my husband and I just spent $5000 on hurricane films on our windows in July.   
We are prepared.   The problem that I have with the new grant program is that once again, we do not qualify.   Our home is valued at more than $500,000.   Had I known that we would qualify, I would have waited until this program went into effect.   There are lots of things that I could have done with an extra few thousand dollars.   Like put it toward my child's private school (because the public schools are so bad here in Florida, even though we personally pay more that $3K a year in school taxes).
My question is......Why do the hard working, responsible, law abiding, tax paying Floridians always get the shaft?   It is very frustrating!
 
I am sure that there is nothing you can do about it, but it would be nice for one day to get something back.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
We all agree that you have done much to improve the lives of all of us who live and work in this state. However, it is obvious that we have several important issues that impact the lives of all of us, particularly our children who are attempting to make a living and live a decent life in his state. 
 
First and foremost is the fact that hard working, honest,  and decent young people, many with responsible jobs in public safety and education, can no longer afford decent housing  due to not only the high cost but also the burden of runaway taxes and insurance. It is apparent that the insurance companies are solely interested in their profits instead of providing a product that is affordable. 
 
Secondly, many of our young people just starting out, as well as many established home owners, cannot afford a  home or are trapped in their present home due to the heavy property tax burden they face. At a time when there are budget surpluses in most state and local government's budgets, it is truly a tragedy that homeowners, and potential homeowners, are not allowed to transfer their homestead exemption with them or have some other type of tax remedy. The failure of state government to enact some type of meaningful tax reform is causing many potential residents to move elsewhere and the results are all too obvious to many employers. 
 
There are also many other issues that need to be addressed such as teachers salaries, additional troopers on our highways who are paid a decent salary, and health care that is provided to all of our residents, but somehow we seem to be more interested in what the NRA or lobbyists want, and where dog owners can eat with their pets. 
 
Until we address these major issues, this state and its residents will continue to ask "why isn't our state government responsive to our basic needs". So far the answer is "nothing". 
 
If you do nothing else before you leave office, please address these urgent and pressing needs. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Charles Miller

I am considering selling my home in Broward County and purchasing a smaller home in Palm Beach County.  However, if I do this my real estate taxes skyrocket.  My current taxes are based on the purchase price of my home that I purchased 10 years ago, while the taxes I would pay on the new home will be based on the purchase price today.
Given the enormous appreciation in the past few years, my tax bill multplies.   I understand that there are several versions of possible legislation to address this issue that is of great concern to many people in Florida.  I would like to know what is happening with this legislation and when we may expect to see a change?  My related question is, if there is a change will it be state wide or county by county. In other words, if I sell in Broward and buy in Palm Beach would the legislation still be of benefit to me?

                        More feel insurance crisis pinch


                        PINELLAS PARK, Fla. -- Aug. 14, 2006 -- Florida's high-priced insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., is increasingly becoming the only choice for thousands of condominium associations, resulting in skyrocketing unit maintenance fees and special assessments to pay the rate increases.



                        Since April, the number of condominium associations covered by the state-sponsored insurer has gone from 3,500 to 5,000, Citizens officials said, and new applications are coming in at a clip of 250 a week.



                        The increase is because of major insurers such as Allstate, Nationwide and State Farm exiting the condo market. That comes on top of the financial insolvency in June of Southern Family Insurance Co., a Poe Financial Group company and a major insurer of condominiums.



                        Over the past few months, Citizens has become the largest property insurer in Florida, mainly from homeowners who can't find coverage elsewhere.



                        "We are a symptom of a sick market," Christine Turner, Citizens director of consumer and legislative affairs told a group of condominium association officials in Pinellas Park on Friday.



                        "Eight hurricanes in two years has all but shut down the property insurance market in Florida," she said. "In the short term, Citizens is only the answer."



                        That answer, however, translates into much higher rates as condo owners discover the pain that hundreds of thousands of homeowners already have experienced as Citizens policyholders.



                        Condominium associations are seeing rate increases, of 100, 200, even 500 percent over rates in the voluntary market, said insurance brokers present at Friday's meeting.



                        In turn, the associations are sharing that cost with individual owners.



                        Condominium association insurance covers the common parts of a complex, such as unit exterior walls, roofs, foundations, clubhouses, swimming pools and grounds. It is in addition to an individual unit owners' own insurance.



                        Larry Huffman, the finance chairman of the Paradise Village condominium in Treasure Island, said the 51-unit complex is being dropped at the end of the year by its private insurer, and Citizens is the only insurer willing to cover it. He said premium rates are expected to more than quadruple from $87,000 annually to nearly $400,000 for the complex.



                        Huffman said that will raise his individual monthly insurance fees, part of his maintenance payment, from $390 a month to $600.



                        Although most condo owners have benefited by rising property values exceeding 100 percent, they worry that the higher monthly insurance costs will show up in reduced prices when it comes time to sell.



                        "The higher insurance rates will make units less marketable," he says.



                        The news only will get worse, said Paul Palumbo, Citizens chief underwriting officer. Starting Aug. 1, Citizens raised rates by 100 percent for condominiums in wind pool areas, which include the barrier islands in Pinellas County, he said.



                        In March, a second increase will occur as Citizens complies with a legislative mandate to ensure the company can better cope financially with a major hurricane, he said.



                        He did not have details on that increase but said "it would be significant."

Dear Governor Bush:

 

With the ever-rising cost of home insurance, energy costs and with everything else rising with the exception of wages, my time left in this state is very limited.  I am just one of those “regular” people I guess you would call us blue-collar workers who are desperately trying to make ends meet and it is not working.  I do not see someone with a Bachelor’s Degree or PhD driving a dump truck, bus or performing clerical duties because there will be a shortage of blue-collar workers and not to mention the homeless rate will rise even more, we need help here and quickly.

 

So with all of this in mind, could we just to raise the sales tax one penny and take one penny from Lott for every dollar (or half a cent) to help with the skyrocketing costs of home insurance?  This would be less of a burden in the pocket than the insurance companies doubling and tripling our insurance every year. 

 

Thanks for your time.

 

Sincerely,

I just received my home owners policy for this next year. The price of the insurance has gone up from $600.00 to $882.00. We are both retired and live on a fixed income and cannot afford these price increases every year. I cannot afford a condo with a ocean view, the people that do have them should pay the price.
 
 In the policy we have to pay $64.17 to help pay for FL CITIZENS ASSESSMENT,FL EMPA SURCHARE. In other words, we are paying to help other people that cannot get a normal insurance company, because of where they live. 
 
You are charging the wrong people. I should have a set rate, if the Florida insurance company cannot charge enough to break even, it should double and triple the rates so people like us do not have to pay their bills.
 
As you probably already know the insurance industry made billions in profits last year. Ask them how to do it.
 
We will have to go into our savings account to pay for home owner insurance, and there isn't that much money there.

After several e-mails to you about the new grant program to strengthen homes against hurricanes I sent to you to ask that Mobile Homes be included for the purchase of Hurricane Shutters, which nobody on your staff had the decency to reply to, I find out today that Mobile Homes do not qualify for this program.

Subject:	"CITIZENS" Insurance

Citizens Insurance Property Corp, "CITIZENS", was a bad idea in 2003 and is now a terrible mistake.    
I have read that in 2004 "CITIZENS" collected roughly $ 1.4 billion in premiums and millions of in tax dollars. I researched "CITIZENS" financial statement to determine total income vs claim payments. I conclude that only a CPA could fathom "CITIZENS" complicated financial statement.
It may be more cost effective to put "CITIZENS" assets in an interest bearing account. Forget about Reinsurers, etc, etc, simply pay claims out of the account.
"CITIZENS" is now the largest Wind Storm insurer in Florida. Insurance companies are canceling policies that are then covered by "CITIZENS" at a higher premium.
"CITIZENS" should be phased out by regulations that require Insurance Companies to write policies for every type in their inventory. Write all types, or not do business in Florida.
Florida taxpayers should not be in the Insurance business. Personally, I am paying for "CITIZENS" with tax dollars, plus a       $ 104 surcharge on my Homeowners premium.
Government should set the rules/ regulations, then get out of the way & not create another Bureaucracy.

We were just recently notified that American Strategic Insurance Company will not be renewing our house policy.  We have been with them for 3 years without a claim.  We have a new home – built to the newest hurricane standards – elevation, hurricane windows, tied down trusses, etc.    On top of this, it seems there is a law in Florida that prohibits us from even getting a quote from another insurance company until 30 days before our expiration date.  In other words – the insurance companies can cancel us – but we cannot cancel them – nor can we try to get quotes.  
 
Our government needs to take a stand to the insurance companies.  Perhaps we should all cancel our policies and go without – as it seems that the federal government will step in as they are doing in New Orleans and helping people who had no insurance.  
 
Please take this matter seriously – the insurance companies need to be stopped from all the increases and we as consumers must be able to make choices on new policies without the law that prohibits us from doing this.

Subject:	Florida Insurance Crisis

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I am an average homeowner and have lived in Florida all my life. I have two daughters and like everyone, my family has been impacted by the affects of the hurricanes. Not necessarily by physical damage but by the financial affects. 
 
My homeowners insurance went from $2500 per year in 2003 & 2004 to $13,000 2005 and  $14,000+ this year.  I think you would agree that this is a ridiculous increase.  If rates continue to climb, I'm afraid I will have to sell my home, that I have worked 20 years to obtain, and move out of the state. I love Florida and am sickened by the deterioration of the basic needs of true Floridians.  The insurance issue should be at the VERY TOP of your agenda and I hope that your committee, with all the politics aside, can suggest a long term solution (Quickly!!!)
 
Homeowners should have access to coverage for catastrophic events separate from the normal homeowners policy. Catastrophic coverage should have levels of risk, the more risk the homeowner wants to accept, the cheaper the coverage is. I cannot afford $14000 per year for homeowners coverage but if my insurance were back to where it was before the hurricanes, say $2500 and I choose a catastrophic policy with a 10%, 15% or whatever risk exposure (I determine the total risk dollars I can assume) and the policy would reflect rates per my risk choices, at then I would know where I'm at and feel I had some control. I have no idea how to plan for such increases as we've experienced the past two years. I wonder what my children will do and what this crisis is going to do to all new homeowners who cannot get affordable
 coverage? The impact will be devastating to this state. If Insurance companies want to write policies in Florida, they should not be able to be selective in what types. All or nothing! There is much money collected in the state and overall premiums minus claims paid out is most certainly in the favor of the insurance industry. They take 1 or 2 bad hits and it's like they never made any money and are ready to fold up and go home. It shouldn't work that way. If the state took all the premiums collected over the past 10 years minus the total paid out, we'd probably have an excess fund somewhere (if administration expenses were kept in control) which I'm not sure that government knows how to do. 
 
I'm just a average Floridian worried about the future - Please do something and do it fast.
 
Regards

GOV. BUSH, 
 
I LISTEN TO YOU AND FOLLOW TELEVISED STATE MEETINGS. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT SINCE 1987. WHAT A GREAT PLACE TO WORK AND RAISE MY KIDS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE WAY YOU CONDUCT THE STATES BUSINESS.   
 
TO THE POINT !!!
 
I AM IN REAL ESTATE AND NOW SEE THE HORRORS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE AVERAGE FLORIDIAN ESPECIALLY THE RETIRED. I RECENTLY MOVED INTO A NEW HOME. 1479 SQ. FT. LIVING. MY INSURANCE LAST YEAR COST APROX. $4600.00. THIS YEARS RENEWAL IS NOW APPROX. $5800.00. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY FIRST PROPERTY TAX BILL YET. MY DREAM IS NOW THINKING ABOUT SELLING. THE AMOUNT OF HOMES LISTED FOR SALE IN HERNANDO COUNTY ARE USUALLY 1000 AVERAGE. SINCE INSURANCE PROBLEMS AFTER KATRINA, THERE ARE NOW 3900 + AS OF TODAY. THE WESTERN PART OF PASCO COUNTY NOW HAS OVER 4000 LISTED HOMES. THE ORLANDO MARKET NOW HAS OVER 20,000 HOMES LISTED. THE HOUSING MARKET HAS KEPT THE ECONOMY GOING OVER THE LAST 4 YEARS. NOW IT HAS STOPPED.         
 
HERE'S MY SUGGESTION.   INSTEAD OF HAVING THE OUT OF CONTROL "CITIZENS" MANAGE OUR INSURANCE OF LAST RESORT, START A STATEWIDE FUND THAT WOULD COVER HURRICANES, TORNADOES, AS AN EXAMPLE. TAKE THE $84.00 THAT EVERYONE IS PAYING TO BAIL OUT CITIZENS ON ALL OUR POLICIES AND BUILD UP/CREATE A $50 BILLION DOLLAR STATE MANAGED FUND FOR HORRIFIC STATE EVENTS. EVERY PROPERTY OWNER PAYS IN TO BUILD THE FUND. ONCE THE FUND HAS REACHED ITS MAXIMUM BALANCE, STOP CHARGING PEOPLE. INVEST SOME OF THAT MONEY AND REPLENISH THE FUND ON THE RETURN. ALLOW THE EXCESS TO GO INTO THE BUDGET FOR SPECIFICS LIKE, HIGHWAYS, SCHOOLS, SALARIES, SECURITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. CAN WE GET FEDERAL MONIES TO START IT OFF?   
 
BY DOING THIS, IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR HURRICANE INSURANCE. INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD ONLY INSURE HOMEOWNERS AND FLOOD AND UNDER ONE (1) POLICY PLEASE. THIS I BELIEVE WOULD BRING BACK MORE INTEREST FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO DO BUSINESS HERE. HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS A LOW RISK BUSINESS, THROW THEM A BONE. 
 
IF YOU CAN GET A DOG IN A RESTAURANT, YOU CAN DO THIS.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU GO OUT WITH A BANG AND NOT A POP.

Subject:	Residential Contractors Liability

Dear Mr. Bush or designee:
 
I am a small residential contractor in North Central Florida with 25+ years of experience building residential, custom homes.  Over the past two years I continuously struggle with finding reasonable liability insurance.  When I think I can afford a company, they come back and increase the rate in a matter of a couple of months and then a couple more months later, I find a notice of cancellation.  I am just a blue collar worker.  I may build 3 or 4 homes a year.  I do not advertise as I believe a custom home is just that - custom dreamed upon by families who sometimes wait a life time to have a home.  I have not been without a job in the past 25 years and have had families wait on me for a year or more as I take pride in the homes I have completed.  I can ask any one of the families for whom I have built and they will tell any one of my reputation.  Not once has there ever been a need for anyone or myself to use the liability insurance but for the life of me, I can't work without it and find that I can't get it.  
Now, I am getting desperate.  I have three agencies looking for companies to insure me.  The cheapest is at $20,000 - $25,000 a year.  For a man to only build 3-4 houses a year, This amount is impossible.  Will I have to give up my business?  Retirement is out of the question - I have always worked for myself and with my boys.  Am I to go out like the farmers?
I pay my taxes and have worked everyday of my life in the heat, rain, wind and because of insurance, I must loose my trade? Where do I go?
Will someone in Tallahassee, please email me back?  I have just received notice that I am considered by the company as a general contractor because I sub 25% of my houses.  This is crazy.  I am just a residential contractor who is getting on in years but knows the codes and adheres to them all.  I just want to work and guess I have to ask someone how to do that and manage after all these years.
I look forward to your reply.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:
I wanted to add my voice to those who feel that the insurance burden for homeowners is becoming a really untenable situation for Floridians.  We all must shoulder the burden, but having just received my renewal, which increased again, this time by 77%, something needs to be done to help get this ever increasing cost under some sort of control, lest we all are forced to join an exodus out of state due to the risk of ever higher insurance costs of all types, especially health, home and auto, which are all among the highest in the country. As a strong supporter of yours and realizing that your time in office is short, I hope that you will continue to seek a solution to something that could seriously damage the future prospects of our State. I hope that insurance companies are not penalizing those that had claims from last year's storms.

Dear Sir,
I have never written to any one in government before. And although this letter may go unread, I just feel its necessary.
my name is Kathleen Ploskonka, from Spring Hill in Hernando County. I am a low income working mother and widow. I have devoted my life to my home and family. I have never been arrested or charged with any crimes. When my husband of 34 years was alive he always held a job. We have never had public assistance. We raisied  our 2 daughters and put them through college. One is a teacher. The other looking into finding a job in her field.  There have been many hardships along the way. But we always pulled through. Until now. I make 13000. a year and receive 5000 from my late husbands pension. From that 2500. goes to homeowners, 2400. to auto insurance and 2600. to health insurance.  Not much left to live on, right. But because I don't give up my American dream of home ownership, I can not apply for any assistance at all. I'm asking for you and your cabinet to look into this insuance crisis here in Florida. Try to help me keep what I own. Thank you for your time. God bless you, your family and this great country we call home.
Sincerely.

Dear Sir:
 
 I just got my insurance bill from my company. In it was a preprinted form on INSURANCE SCORE. I read it, and found out they pulled a credit report. I talked to a lady over there she looked it up, nothing bad on it but nothing showed as to any payments I have made over the last 50 years. On a credit report everything drops off after 10 years. After I talked to her relating the following. She revised my INSURANCE SCORE and refunded me some $151.00.  
 
This was done because FLORIDA changed something last year to allow Insurance companies to do INSURANCE SCORING.  
 
The problem is I am retired now 12 years, All things that I paid for in my business, my home, and everything have now dropped off my credit reports. This now affects my INSURANCE SCORE, I just went to one of my other companies same problem. So most companies are now doing this, its just another way to screw all of us in the state to add to our other problems we have here in Florida.
 
THIS SUCKS  in plain English and I think you office should do something to change this policy.
 
I also want you to know the on Florida Insurance Webb site, Tom Galliger  there is no place there to send him an e-mail, you should also change that. That way people could e-mail his office.

Lt. Governor Jennings,
My husband and I ordered and installed impact resistant windows and have aluminun shutters and plywood for the first floor windows.  We ordered the windows in May, 2006 and they were installed on Juy 24, 2006.  We would like to know if  we would be eligible for any grant money for this.  We did not want to wait, due the the threat of the hurricane season. We are both disabled /retired, and even though this was a big expense, we felt it needed to be done.  
Hopefully we could get some grant money to help with the money we had to pay to do this.
Please let us know if there is any way that we qualify to get any grant money for this.  Thank you for your time,

Subject:	[*] Help with Citizens Insurance

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Thank you for taking your time to read this email, I know that you are very busy. The reason for this email is because I am a t a point where I stand to lose my home through no fault of my own.

During Hurricane Wilma, the roof to our house peeled off and the water started to rush in. Fortunately, my wife and I reacted quickly and we were able to save most of our personal belongings, however we were not so lucky with the house itself. We immediately contacted Citizens Insurance Company and filed a claim. They sent an adjuster within a week; however he was not able to file a report due to "technical difficulties”. He told us that his system was not able to communicate with the system at Citizens. Finally we received word that they had received the claim and were working on it. Citizens sent out checks but it had the wrong names on them so I had to send them back. 

In the interim I tried at my own expense to secure the house by purchasing a blue tarp and placed it over the house. This helped a little, however every time it rained the whole house would be flooded. The tarp does not work on a flat roof which is the type of roof I have. I explained the urgency to citizens but they did not seem to be in a hurry to resolve the issues. Finally after two and a half months of pleading and begging, I drove to Jacksonville to the office of Citizens and asked them to work on the claim while I waited. I then drove to Tallahassee to pick up the checks. I now had the money to at least fix the roof and clean the mold problem that had been created due to the lack of the roof for two months. Since then I have hired a contractor to complete the restoration. There is around $250,000 worth of damage and as of now I have received approximately $105, 000. with which there is a new roof, all demolition completed and most of the rough plumbing and electric. Since the house is old , there is the additional issue of bringing the electrical systems and plumbing systems up to code , which my policy allows for , but Citizens refuses to pay. I am insured for $220.000 plus an additional 25% of the policy for upgrades for code compliance.

 

I also have insurance for additional living expenses of which Citizens has given us less than half. After the hurricane, the house was not livable so we had to move to a rental house at our expense I had to come up with the 1st month, last month and security plus moving expense. My wife and I have been carrying two homes since the hurricane and now stand to lose the home to foreclosure as we are not in the position to complete the restoration or pay two mortgages. My wife took the loss of our house very hard and was not prepared to face another hurricane so I felt it was best to move her and my three daughters out of state closer to her sister. Since then we have moved to western North Carolina. I feel sad that we had to leave Delray, our house and friends, but we had no where to stay and we could not afford to rent or buy another house in the area. I am no longer able to financially bear the burden of carrying to homes and was advised to retain the services of an attorney to sue Citizens. He filed suit and Citizens is trying every which way possible to avoid paying their obligation to me. In the meantime I am not able to fix the house or even rent it.  The attorney says it may take up to 18 months to resolve the case. We are about to go into foreclosure and lose all what my wife and I have worked for, just because the insurance company refuses to pay what I am insured for. I am not asking for more than that.

I am asking for your help as I do not know what to do or who to turn to. All we want to do is to be able to fix the house and move on. We are in a dire situation and we need help.   

Please Governor Bush, I would greatly appreciate it if you could assist with this matter. You can contact me at 561 901 2610 or at 828 298 0191 or by email at mark1162@aol.com

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
Since I wrote my last letter to you regarding our property insurance challenges, we have received a notice of non-renewal from the current wind insurer for the condo association. Our question is this: if we are compelled to self-insure our wind risk because a of lack of affordable market alternatives, are you (is the state) going to enforce the statute that requires us to have 10 associations in our pool with a non-profit umbrella organization to do so? 
 
Obviously, as we stated before we'd appreciate having those requirements struck from the statutes so that we can do what we can about our property risk, and still be within the law. But since we need to act on this immently (not the legislature's warp speed, smile), we would appreciate knowing form you whether you intend to enforce the current statutory requirements for self-insurance for condo associations during the current property insurance crisis. 
 
Thanks in advance for your quick reply to our question.

Hello,
 
Thank you for responding.
 
Unbelieveably you officials think that we are all that STUPID. 
First Home Insurance Co. was my complaint. The fact that they have only been doing business in the state of Florida since May 2nd, 2005., means they totally did not have any losses from the 04. Hurricane Season. Another Factoid is Katrina Losses were by in large FLOOD.! Normal Homeowner Policies DO NOT COVER FLOODS., thus no losses.
I spoke to an Allstate guy which his company is not writing Homeowner Policies. He stood there in front of his 3.2 Million dollar house and said"The Till is EMPTY". Yeah, right.
 
We don't buy any of this crap.
We also can't wait to get out of this swamp called Florida and corrupt politicians such as Gallagher, Harris, ETC.ETC. Every single one of you have or have had Conflicts of Interest.

Subject: Concerns regarding homeowner's insurance

Dear Friend:

 

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding homeowner’s insurance.  Governor Bush appreciates your views and asked me to respond on his behalf. 

 

As a result of the past hurricane seasons, property insurance rates have increased.  The Governor knows this is a challenging reality for homeowners, businesses, and local governments, but understands increased rates are a common market reaction to the risk associated with insuring homes and businesses in Florida at a time when so much damage was caused by recent hurricanes.  

 

Governor Bush believes the underlying problems in the property insurance market can be resolved by encouraging mitigation of homes and buildings to make them more resistant to wind damage, and by encouraging private insurance companies to underwrite more of the state’s wind risk.  This would minimize the number of policies and the amount of claims exposure for Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens), the state’s insurer of last resort.  Citizens covers those who cannot obtain property insurance from the private market.     

 

On May 16, 2006, Governor Bush signed Senate Bill 1980 into law.  This bill provides policy reforms and funding to stabilize and improve the property insurance market.  Senate Bill 1980 assists private insurance companies with an Insurance Capital Build-up Incentive Program allowing private insurance companies to underwrite more policies in Florida.  The bill provides funding for free home inspections and grants for homeowners who choose to reinforce their homes against wind damage through the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program.  It also provides funding to offset the deficit of Citizens, reducing assessments to homeowners, and provides reforms to prevent future Citizens’ assessments.  Those with internet access can view the complete text of the bill online by typing in the bill number on the Senate’s homepage at www.flsenate.gov.

 

Governor Bush believes that long-term reforms are necessary to repair the underlying problems that exist in the insurance market.  The Governor created the “Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee” to address these important issues.  This Executive Order is online at: www.flgov.com/executive_orders.

 

Thank you again for writing.  Governor Bush wants to know how Floridians feel about the many critical issues we face and encourages you to share your views with your local legislative delegation.  Please be assured that the Governor will keep your ideas in mind as he forms policy for addressing these concerns.

RE: Insurance in the State of Florida
 
Dear Lt Governor Jennings
 
 
Our property owners association (Inverness Landings, Inverness, FL) was recently notified by Allstate Insurance Company that the insurance coverage on the exterior and common areas and on the amenities of our condominium community where I reside is being cancelled. I have the required insurance coverage on the interior of my unit only, as the Association has always provided sufficient insurance to cover the exterior and common areas. All of the unit owners of our small complex have been advised by the Board of Directors that it will be necessary to charge each owner a special assessment of anywhere between $813.00 and $3048.00. This must be done thirty days prior to the expiration of our current policy in order to pay the up front premium that is required by the state insurance company.  According to the current insurance agents for our association, this state insurance company will not finance premiums and, therefore, we must pay the very high premium upfront. Prior to cancellation, the amount of my yearly maintenance fee that was going for insurance was approximately $202.26, a monthly rate of approximately $17.00.
 
As you can imagine, having to come up with a 300%-1400% increase in a short period of time on a fixed income presents an unreasonable financial burden on me and other property owners in our community and in other communities across the state. Due to the fact that we are in the middle of hurricane season, I know that our Association cannot go without insurance. My request is that something be done to review the insurance situation in this state and to fairly and justly determine premium costs based on actual claims, just like insurance companies do on auto insurance (e.g. many accidents, citations= higher premiums). To my knowledge, our Association has only had one claim since its inception in 1987, and the total amount of that was approximately one year’s premium. I do understand that, in order to cover uninsured owners, there is an add-on premium, but there should be a better way to come up with the necessary funds.
 
Any help or information you can offer me and other owners would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.

Just wondering if they plan on Turing the state to get the opinions of the mass majority on how they fill about paying for an insurance they don't use. Those who can afford private insurance are paying out the _____________ to keep it. I would like to be more educated on this program.

Subject:	East Milton Residents

Governor Bush,
 
I read the following article in Saturday's Pensacola News Journal and I have to say I was shocked!
 
Santa Rosa County drops plan to seek funds for storm shelters

Santa Rosa County will not apply for state money to retrofit the East Milton Recreation Park gym, Berryhill Elementary School or the Chumuckla Community Center as emergency shelters.

County Administrator Hunter Walker said a structural engineer reviewed all three buildings and said it would not be cost-effective to strengthen them to the American Red Cross' standards.

Instead, the County Commission voted Thursday to only apply for grant money to purchase storm shutters for the Chumuckla facility.

Walker, however, pointed out that those facilities one day could be used as shelters, but they would not be staffed by the Red Cross.
 
East Milton is a central location for so many to come and stay during a storm.  Number one you have all of the beach residents who will come and second you have so many from Harold and East Milton and surrounding areas that are willing to utilize the facility if needed. I sat back as did many and watched so many from the East Milton area almost loose their own lives to stay home rather that to travel to the Milton Community Center or to leave town.  So many in this area do not have the funds or means to leave town and stay in motel rooms or what have you.  Many are elderly residents who can't travel very far (if at all) and are on dire need of a facility they can go to be safe. I know I have personally spoke with MANY over here that thought that since the commissioners finally decided to put a facility over here that East Milton residents and the surrounding communities were finally getting recognized.  We have sat back for years now and watched Pace, Pea Ridge, Milton and Chumuckla, Gulf Breeze and Navarre get everything.  This is including all of the business growth.  It seems to me that East Milton will only get what the rest of the county does not want, Prison's, Jail's, Dump sites, etc.  To me since VERY LITTLE of Santa Rosa'a funding has gone to help the residents of this part of the community that requesting a safe place to go during a storm should NOT be a problem or an issue.  Chumuckla residents did NOT endure the problems the residents in East Milton did during Ivan and to make another shelter over on that side of town and completely over look the residents here should not be tolerated by yourself or anyone else who lives in East Milton. 
Governor Bush, I have sat silently back and been very patient to see if the commissioners or someone in office would do the right thing finally for East Milton and after this was written in Saturday's paper I am finding it very hard to continue to do this. Now I have heard that they are saying it was stopped @ the State level.  I am hoping that with your help we can do what is right for this side of town and not have them once again over-looked.   
Thank you for your time and I will respectfully wait on your reply.

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush,
 
I am a stay at home mother of 3. We own a home in Lutz, FL in south-central Pasco Co.. Our homeowner's insurance was cancelled in July 2006. My home is 15 years old and we were forced to go with Citizen's Insurance at $2929.00 per year , an increase of $2200.00 a year! Ouch!!! We had to give our savings to pay for this increase. I was told that the reason for such a massive increase was because of sink holes and of course hurricanes. Sink holes? We don't have sink holes in south-central Pasco; I also live 1/2 mile from the Hillsborough County line. 
 
I have a question !
 
1. Why should I pay more because of sink holes if we are so far away from sick holes? Sinkholes are a problem in NW Pasco.
 
2. We are in an inland area of Pasco, so why should we pay more for hurricane damage if we are so far from the coast?
 
and ..
3. Can new legislation allow for insurance companies to look at zip codes to determine or justify rate increases for supposed sink holes or hurricane wind risk??
 
Please do something! We are leaving Florida if things do not change.
 
It is a sad time for Florida.
 
Thank you,
 
Mrs. Anita Kelliher

Mr. Bush,
I am a very concerned Dade-County citizen regarding the increase rate of my homeowners insurance.  I have been told by Sunshine State Insurance, Co. (1-877) 563-0150  (Policy #MNJ 0034478 05 07) that my insurance is going to double in it's premium.  I would like to know what is being done, currently, about Miami-Dade's insurance companies extreme hikes in their premiums.  I have tried to see if I can change insurance companies but was told by State Farm (who I initially had coverage with but they sold my insurance to the state) that they cannot take me because I am currently covered under Sunshine State and if I drop them and tried to get on with State Farm there would be a high surcharge which would be more than what Sunshine is going to charge me.

I know that I am not the only citizen in Dade-County concerned with this and this is why I am trying to find out what my options are and if Dade-County is working on this issue.  My new premium will be due in November and I don't want to wait until the last minute to find out what my options are.  

This is the first time I have looked to help from you and I would appreciate any assistance you could offer me.  If you would like to speak with me, I can be reached at home (305) 246-7848 or my cell (786) 295-0022.

Dear Governor Bush
            I live in a condo here in Cocoa Beach, and have just been notified that
our condo insurance (which is required by Florida Statues and underwritten by Citizens Property Insurance Corp.) will increase by 250%.
            This translates to a "charge" or assessment this year to me of approximately $2,200.00, which at this time I can just about afford. However, there are many other owners in our condo that are living on a fixed income and with this hefty additional cost for their apartment they can ill afford. 
            From what I can recall, the last Legislature session barely addressed this problem but just delayed any action with the results that there is a "revolt"
all over Florida, not only from home owners but business owners. They (and I) 
are deeply concerned. Now according to the media, this insurance issue is 
becoming a election year campaign strategy, instead of an issue that must
be resolved now. 
            Governor Bush, at this point in time, it would seem that the only proper
action to take is to call for a special session of the legislature right now, before it gets completely out of hand.

Dear Govenor Bush: 

My 73 year old mother lives in a condo in Palm Harbor, FL.  Today she received notice from her condo association stating due to the increase in homeowners insurance she would need to come up with and pay a insurance assessment of $2,500 and in addition starting January 2007 her condo maintenance fee would go from the $255.00 she is now paying to $425.00 a month next year.  Now lets be realistic, yes..even though people are still moving rapidly into Florida, lets face it, these people have absolutely no idea what they are getting into untill they get here. Most Floridians right now are trying to figure out a why to move out of here.  Thats if they can find someone to buy their home or condo with these hefty insurance rates.  Tennesee is looking good with their $400.00 per year average homeowners insurance rate.  Lets be realistic, who's going to buy a condo with a continuely rising monthy maintance fee of $425.00 per month and due to keeping up with other expenses even much higher. 

I am homeowner in Clearwater Florida, I plan on purchasing absolute necessities untill this is resolved, because right now I have to look at the fact that I am no different then the man that wrote into the newspaper and said his insurance company dropped him and his new rate with Citizens Insurance this year would be $5,000.00.  Per this man $2,500.00 down and balance due in 60 days and thats just this year.  Florida is not only in a state of Emergency, its headed towards severe poverty.   

Please let me know as a citizen of Florida and the USA if there is anything I can do to make a difference.

Dear Govenor Bush, 

My wife and I certainly hope the situation with Citizens has become one of your #1 priorities.  We were disgusted and appalled at the amount we had to pay for our Palm Harbor condo both for outside and inside contents.  Our salaries did not triple because there were horrible hurricane seasons, yet both of our insurance invoices tripled.  Honestly we do not know how the people with Citizens sleep at night with their greed.  

We could certainly understand claims rising if we owned property by or near the ocean.  However, our condo is in the last evacuation area and we are on the 2nd floor……..not near the beach.

This is the talk of seniors that retire to Florida, people who are selling property and buying property in Florida, around water coolers and at coffee shops.  Bottom line is that something has to be done.

Property Insurance was charged as the cost and replace of the Price/Value of your car (and it's extras).
Then the policy holders that want to LIVE ON the beaches and in the flood areas....CAN Pay higher rates.
Simple:
IF I drove a Geo Metro,Toyota, Small car......compared to Driving a Rolls Royce, Cadillac, Luxury Car....
Property Insurance Could be the same!
Many of my friends and parents friends in Florida....are not paying for such High rates of Wind and Hurricane insurance...
Their properties are paid off.  So they put the $12,000 per year that it would cost for Wind and Hurricane Insurance in the bank.(Lost customers!!!!)

To the Honorable GOVERNOR JEB BUSH,

I am glad you strongly agree that the tax system must change. However, this 
is more than changing the tax system. This issue is Equitable taxation and 
equal treatment before the law! I believe our constitutional right to be 
equally treated before the law has been violated in this matter. I hope you 
share my concerns to preserve our constitutional rights of equality by 
requiring our Government to institute equitable property taxation.

I have attached a rough draft for the necessary changes to Article VII, 
Section 4 of the Florida Constitution that address the immediate concern of 
bringing "other" property in line with the Homestead properties so that our 
rights under Article I, Section 2 are recognized.

I am hoping that the Govenor can take immediate injunctive measures to 
protect Florida property owners and lead the Legislatures to fix the 
problem.

Ideally, a special session of the Legislature should be called by the 
Govenor and a joint resolution to put the amendment before the people by 
referendum could short cut a lot of unnecessary time delays by eliminating 
an initiative petition.

An integrated team with an integrated approach to the problem is needed. The 
real direction is to set out to draft an amendment to the Constitution that 
does not favor one special interest group over another. A home owners 
exemption is commendable and should be in place. But the implementation of 
the exemption along with the reassessment cap for SOH "only" distorted the 
equity in the tax laws. The result is lopsided taxation and violation of 
Section 2 of the Constitution.

The legislative electorate chose to leave the 2006 session without any 
resolution. Doing so allows the citizens to suffer the legal, but abusive, 
taxing authority given to the local governments. No stop gap measures were 
considered. I am sure that our elected representatives are aware of the 
impending tax increases. Why is there no action! This situation is about to 
become a major political crisis.

I am seeking your assistance as a leader in the State Government to bring 
this insufferable tax increase to a halt through injunctive methods until 
the Legislature can properly addresses it and equitable resolution for all 
people and Citizens of Florida is achieved.

Sincerely
Michael Doyle

Thank you for your letter to Governor Bush regarding property tax rates.
He appreciates hearing your views and has asked that I respond on his
behalf.

Governor Bush certainly appreciates your concerns regarding the
increasingly unfair property tax burden on Floridians.  There are
several inequities in our property tax structure which have become more
apparent in recent years.  In fact, in its recently ended regular
session, the Florida Legislature struggled with all of these issues, but
could not find a comprehensive solution because of the complexity of the
problem.  Consequently, the Legislature commissioned the Florida
Department of Revenue to conduct an in-depth study of the property tax
structure, with special emphasis on the unequal effects among various
groups of taxpayers.  Additionally, the Governor has appointed a 15
member committee to consider the research findings of the Department of
Revenue and others and to propose to the Legislature changes to the tax
system.  I know that this sounds like they are trying to avoid the
issue, but in all honesty, a thorough understanding of all the
consequences of any changes in Florida's property tax system must come
before concrete proposals are put forth.  This is particularly important
because the changes that are likely to be needed will require amendments
to the Florida Constitution, which will, in turn, require voter
approval.

Thank you again for contacting Governor Bush with your concerns.  He
always appreciates hearing from Florida taxpayers, whether they are
permanent residents or seasonal visitors.

Sincerely,

Tiffany McClellan

Subject:	Insurance Reform  Committee "HELP"

I am so frustrated with the rising costs of insurance in our state. No only are the costs rising but our company "Nationwide Insurance" has been reducing the quality of our insurance policy for the past 5 years.
Let me explain.
We bought their premier policy which covered full replacement value for losses. We have been their customer for 12 years!
Then they started sending us notices to tell us that they were changing the coverage "reducing" coverage and excluding valuable coverage. They have chopped up our policy until there isn't much that they have at risk since any major losses get passed on to the reinsurer any way.
For example....they reduced coverage and do not cover water damage or mold or replacement "just repair" for loss incurred. Now they won't cover liability for our boat because they reduced the size boat they will insure to a limit under 26 feet 1". My husband and I own a florida built boat that is 28 feet. "That will make the boat manufacturers in Florida unhappy too! I think they should  be required to keep coverage in place that they have insured when they have not had to pay any claims for the coverage received.
 
Your new committee needs to look closely at the way insurers do their accounting. They actually make alot of money that they can transfer to reserve accounts and at the end of the policy year there books show them as making minimum gains because they can hide their money in reserve accounts.
 
When they do have losses they are able to pass them on to others and the re-insurance pays and we pay for the re-insurance too.
 
I think they should have to account for all their reserve monies and the reserve accounts should have to be adjusted to reflect their actual earnings by returning it to their bottom line when those reserves aren't actually paid out in claims at the end of the year.They like to keep the money in reserves for up to 5 years while their profit and loss statement goes from policy year to policy year.
 
In addition the committe should look at the fact that insurance companies actually make money when there are natural disasters like storms because they get to insure the re-build in the state which generates more profits for them on new construction from government insured loans.
I really think that in order to solve this insurance crisis this is what needs to happen.........
 
1. Insurance companies should only be able to underwrite the number of polices in any state equal to the amount of financial solvency that company has within it self before 're-insurance"
 
2. Give new companies incentives to come and write the surplus here at competative prices and again they should only be able to write what they can pay for without insulating theirself by being able to pass their large losses on to a third party. Presently the carriers that are writing here gobble up so much business here that they have too much risk in one state. Then they chop up the policies that they have on their books reducing the protection for customers and all the while they maintain a large profit center for theirselves because it's hard for other companies to get started here. 
Limit the amount that any one company can write here. Bring in many more companies that would be willing to take a piece of the pie and share some of the risk. 
 
3.Require insurance companies to give discounts that are meaningful. We have increased deductables and certainly have a no frills policy that results in a reduction of only $30.00 per year. That's nothing compared to how much we have to commit to pay out of pocket for any loss less than a total loss. In addition, where discounts are available for storm protection like shutters and tie-downs and so forth the homeowner has to pay for a licensed inspector "$200.00 for a discount that will be in the neighborhood of $80.00. 
 
4. Require insurance companies to tailor the policy to the homeowners needs...for example my policy makes me take contents insurance of more than $75000.00 as part of the standard policy. This amount is excessive since my contents and personal property are no where near that amount in value. I asked to have the amount reduced and the insurer said that it's standard and I have to carry that much insurance on contents even if I believe I am over insured in that area.
 
5.Encourage insurers to let homeowers buy insurance "ala-carte" for example we should be able to either buy a package or just liability if that's what we need. I have had to spend Sunday morning searching the internet for liability coverage for my little day sailer because I can't get it with my homeowers package any more. A product like that priced at about $75.00 a year isn't something most carriers want to  bother with. 
 
6. Time to introduce some new markets to start up companies looking to expand their book of business with minimal risk. 
 
In summary...All of us homeowners know your aware that there is a crisis here and we don't know how long we can hang on to our homes in Florida. We are being priced out of the state. School enrollment was actually down in our district because there were not as many children to serve as anticipated from surveys taken. Reason.....young families cannot afford to purchase a home in Hillsborough county. Who can afford the homes  that are being  built on the income received for jobs in this area...not many! 
 
We support our state...Help us with our insurance and Homestead exemption!
 
Thank you

I really agree with your decision to have the State of Florida embark into Business and other insurance. After 25 years with Eastern Airlines, I spent 10 years with USAA Insurance. One fact that was obvious, is that all insurance companies like to collect copious premiums and hate paying claims back! A further fact was that insurance companies do make great profits most years, and they never go back and discount future premiums based upon past profits. The dividends are paid, they base it upon state regions, and the next year is expected to be profitable or the increased premium needs are passed on to the customers.  
I predict that the State of Florida will actually make money, that you will do a good job in controlling cost variables, and that within the following year it will dawn on the insurance companies that they really screwed up by allowing the State to become a partner in a most profitable industry. Then they will want you out. 
My recommendation is that you stay awhile. They windfall for the state could be impressive, and put your profits into education and health care.

Honorable Govenor Bush,
I am afraid I am now forced to sell my home of 25 years.  I now have to have Flood, Wind and Homeowner's insurance policies. The homeowner's policy is now deleting sink hole coverage, so that will be an additional policy when offered.
 
I have a serious problem right now as the wind policy with $199,000 coverage was costing $2001 for last year's premiun with Florida Peninsula Insurance Co. in Sunrise, FL.  I received my renewal policy and bill effective August 21, 2006 to August 21, 2007 with a premium of  $4,478. with a dwelling coverage of $217,000.  This is an increase of  224% on the premium.   (I did not request any increase on coverage of dwelling.)
 
Was this company granted the right to this major increase?  I was never given a notice for an increase in premium to this policy.  I would have tried to find something less costly.  I do not know how I will be able to pay this by August 21, 2006.
 
I need to know if they have a right to do this. Isn't this price guaging?

thousands of dollars into election campaigns of lawmakers, state political 
parties and candidates for statewide offices.

Insurers now can automatically raise prices for homeowner coverage 10 percent 
without any state review. And to make Florida even more enticing to property 
insurers, legislators tossed in $250 million in loans for insurers willing to 
expand in this state.

The changes have been hailed across the country by the insurance industry as a 
big help to do business in a hurricane-battered state.

Consumer activists say it was a giveaway to an industry that already gets its 
way in Tallahassee.

Analysts say the legislation was not a surprise, given the industry's 
consistent political donations.

``It's always hard to say that the money bought something specifically, but the 
money certainly buys the industry access to decision-makers,'' said Sue 
O'Connell, research director for the Institute on Money and State Politics, a 
nonpartisan watchdog group based in Montana. ``It opens doors and allows them 
[insurers] access in a way that the typical citizen may not have. It also seems 
pretty clear from the way that industry distributes its donations that Florida 
is a pretty important state to the insurance companies.''

Since 1996, the property insurance industry has given $11.2 million to Florida 
candidates and state political parties, with roughly three of every four 
dollars to Republicans, according to research by the South Florida Sun-
Sentinel.

The 2006 campaigns already have received at least $1.7 million from the 
property insurance industry, state records show.

O'Connell has examined property insurance industry campaign contributions 
across the country over three election cycles -- 2000, 2002, and 2004 -- and 
found Florida is vital to the property insurance market, judging by where the 
industry spends its campaign donations.

She said that in 2004, Florida ranked No. 10 among all states in total 
contributions from political donors. But in candidate contributions from the 
property insurance industry, she said, Florida politicians ranked second in the 
nation, behind only California that year.

Most donations to GOP

The insurance industry has given the bulk of its money to the party in power, 
the Sun-Sentinel has found. At least $4 million has been given in the last 
decade to the Republican Party of Florida, mainly from industry trade groups 
and associations but also from insurers, their lobbyists and executives.

By contrast, the Florida Democratic Party received slightly more than $1 
million.

The contributions represent a small fraction of what's given each year to state 
parties and candidates in Florida. Other industries, such as telecommunications 
businesses, home builders and real estate agents, give more. Sun-Sentinel 
research found that about 2 percent of what's been given to all Florida 
campaigns and state parties since 1996 -- or $11.2 million of more than $557 
million -- can be reported as having come from the property insurance 
industry.

Campaign finance analysts say the Florida insurance industry still packs a 
political wallop. That power was on display May 16 when Gov. Jeb Bush signed 
into law the 156-page property insurance bill that guarantees higher 
policyholder costs and bigger insurance industry profits.``This is the most 
significant, comprehensive property insurance legislation that has been enacted 
since Hurricane Andrew,'' said Len Brevik, the national executive vice 
president and chief executive officer of the National Association of 
Professional Insurance Agents. He said it's ``precisely the kind of 
innovation'' that Congress should mimic.

Critics call it a politically timid and anti-consumer answer to what ails 
Florida's insurance market. The law has been criticized in recent weeks by 
Democratic candidates for governor and some Republicans, such as state Rep. 
Randy Johnson of Winter Garden, a candidate to be Florida's chief financial 
officer.

``The insurance crisis has crept on the kitchen tables of Floridians and they 
are mad about it and responding to it. ...,'' Johnson said of reaction to 
increased rates. ``It is about insurance company greed, plain and simple.''

While some candidates criticize the law as an industry sellout, Florida's top 
insurance regulators, such as state Chief Financial Officer Tom Gallagher, a 
Republican running for governor, say it was just the start of a solution. His 
2006 gubernatorial campaign has received at least $379,000 in donations from 
the insurance industry. Only the Republican and Democratic state parties and 
Bush's gubernatorial campaigns have received more money from the state's 
insurers than Gallagher has taken in for his 2006 race for governor.

He also has received at least $369,000 in industry donations during previous 
campaigns for other state offices, including the one he holds.

Gallagher campaign aides say Gallagher is not beholden to the insurers.

``No one has been more forceful and cracked down on insurance companies more 
than Tom Gallagher,'' said Alberto Martinez, Gallagher's gubernatorial 
spokesman. ``He's called State Farm and Allstate out on the carpet whenever 
they've tried raising rates and not responding to their customer's needs. ... 
Tom has a record of fighting for consumers and a record of speaking his 
mind.''

Campaign finance records show Jeb Bush's campaign for governor in 2002 received 
at least $201,000 from the property insurance industry. This year, he gave 
legislators surprisingly little guidance on how to fix the state's troubled 
property insurance market.

During his State of the State speech in early March, Bush called for better 
hurricane preparedness but provided no direction about insurance issues, 
including what to do with financially troubled Citizens Property Insurance 
Corp. Citizens is the state-run home insurer, and now the state's biggest 
property insurer. Its size is a sore point the state never intended.

When Bush signed the new property insurance bill into law, he knew consumers 
wouldn't be happy. ``I will accept responsibility that we will have higher 
rates,'' Bush said.

Bush and Republican legislators made their first move when they created the 
Task Force on Long-Term Solutions for Florida's Hurricane Market prior to the 
2005 hurricane season.

The 13-member task force conducted eight public meetings. The panel of mostly 
insurance industry insiders overwhelmingly recommended short-term, industry-
friendly solutions, only some of which were adopted.

In a 58-page report, the task force repeatedly called for what the Florida 
property insurance industry wanted -- ``greater flexibility'' with regulators. 
``The majority of the people on the task force had some industry tie,'' said 
Steve Burgess, a task force member and a consumer advocate who works under the 
state Office of Insurance Regulation.

`Afraid to be bold'

Some legislators, insurance industry lobbyists and analysts say lawmakers 
settled on the bill because of their concern about doing more harm than good.

``The single biggest issue that will cause the state's economy to stop is not 
handling this insurance situation correctly,'' said Sen. J.D. Alexander, a Lake 
Wales Republican on the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee. Records show 
Alexander, who helped negotiate the final bill, has accepted at least $95,000 
in donations from insurance interests to his political campaigns since 1996.

Bush says Florida is better off with the law than nothing.

``It's not easy to make the tough choices,'' Bush said. ``If we had not made 
the tough choices this year, it would have come back to haunt us.''

Others don't see it that way.

``A lot of these issues are technical. So a lot of legislators aren't 
comfortable with certain things. When an insurance company lobbyist says `this 
and this,' it's pretty difficult for someone who is not an expert to know that 
they are lies,'' said Birny Birnbaum, an economist with the Center for Economic 
Justice, in Austin, Texas.

Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, 
said: ``The (Florida) Legislature is afraid to be bold. They were so afraid 
that the industry is going to bolt that they won't take the kind of action that 
needs to be taken.''

Subject:	Homeowners Insurance

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
                      I moved to Florida seven years ago because I retired from my job and visited Florida several times over the years. I chose to move to Florida because it was cheaper to live here than in Long Island, New York and because of the warm weather yearound and to get away from the harsh winters of the Northeast. I have had the same insurance company for 30 years including New York, When I came to Florida my home insurance was $400 a year, Its now up to $2500 seven years later. I know I'm not the only one, but why can't something be done to get some relief from this huge hike in insurance. Its not fair to homeowners that dont live near the water and have had no claims to bail out ones who have million dollar mansions on the water and have put in for huge claims. Its very difficult to keep paying these huge increases in insurance along with rapidly rising energy and food prices as well when youre on a fixed income. I hope someone out there understands the burden we are facing and someone does something about it before its too late and everything falls apart including the real estate industry. Its extremely painful and is putting a lot of strain on my budget. Please act and do something to get our Homeowners insurance rates down to a more reasonable level.
 
                                Thank You

Sir, please help protect Floridians from being devastated by the insurance companies. Homeowners and Small Business owners will be forced out by the rising cost of insurance. Follow the example set by President Regan when he was Governor of California and put an end to this.

Recently it has come to my attention, through personal bills and discussing bills with other people, that private insurance companies have a "Citizens" insurance surcharge on our statements. The average money that I have inquired about has been around $175.00 (yr).  When did the prople of Florida approve or vote on subsidizing Citizens Insurance or any other state insurance choice?  They have been indicted by the Federal government and now the people are expected to "bail out" Florida's insurance commissioners and governors msitake!  Citizens has not even paid the claims from Huricane Charlie.  Where is the justice is that?  Is it even legal?  Are the taxpayers in Florida supposed to pay for their corruption? 
 
If an insurance company sells "Homeowners Policies" in any other state and they refuse to sell policies at the same "Equitable" rate here in Florida,  The should NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SELL ANY TYPE OF INSURANCE in the state of Florida.  They only want High-Profit policies but not ones they may loose money on.  That is the risk in the insurance industry.  They have taken money for many years, from all over the state, but when they have to start paying out a large amount of money they want out of it
 
My statement above will work because they make more money on automobile and life and medical etc. insurances than just homeowners.  I wonder IF any of our candidates has the "guts" to put that notion into their campaign and "Follow It Through".       
 
I would be very interested in any response you or any other viewer would have in ragards to these statements.

Dear Governor Bush,
     I have read that State Farm has been approved to raise home owner's 
insurance rates for our home in Broward County approximately 78%.  That will 
increase our rates from $3500/year to over $6200.  Even with Hurricane Wilma, we 
were not able to file a claim as our deductible is well over $5000.  I am a 
teacher and my husband is in the hospitality industry.  Neither of us get an 
increase anywhere near this amount and I have taught for 24 years.  Something 
must be done as families like us cannot afford to stay in Florida.  As the 
school year opens on Monday, many of my colleagues are gone already to Georgia, 
North Carolina and other states.  Save our state and communities.  Help families 
afford to live here.  The rise in insurance rates and other costs of living are 
driving us away.

I am so tired of all of this.  Insurance companies should not be able to pick and choose what products they can sell in Florida.  If the companies want to sell annuities and car insurance and life insurance in Florida, they should also be required to sell homeowner's insurance.  It is not right that they can make money from Floridians and then refuse to serve them.  The rash of hurricanes in the last few years have been more expensive, but so have premiums.   I used to pay $289 per year in 1985, now I am paying $1895.  My Salary in 1985 was $27K per year and now its $57k per year,  It just doesn't compare.

Massachusetts has an appointed insurance commissioner as apposed to an elected.  Campaign contributions don't play in the commissioners choices.  They also implement the above rule;  you sell every service you have, or you don't provide any… period.  

This is not an overnight fix, but it is VERY VERY viable and doable in a relatively short period of time.  

It is not right that Florida should have to self insure (not only should we not have to, a government  ran/backed insurer cannot be effective…as proven everyday in the government operations)  If Florida does have to self insure, then maybe they should start a business that does it all, because obviously it is very profitable and eliminate all outside insurance;  all premiums and fees go to the state to be distributed per contract at the time of the event (retirement, death, accident or other)

I am so angry that the insurance lobby has so much power in this state, that they can make it uninhabitable for all working class people, retirees and anyone who does not have to be careful about spending money.

In addition, with the slow real estate sales, gluts of new houses not selling, increased insurance and taxes, the bankruptcy rate in this state is going to skyrocket in the next 12-24 months, we are going to see a mass exodus of Florida and it will be primarily the working class, unable to afford to live here;  then who will serve the tourist.

This is a snowball that is already moving and could (and will) devastate Florida in its entirety.

As an outgoing Governor, whether you personally are responsible or not, this will be your legacy…

Thank you

Governor Bush,
 
Now that it appears an emergency cure is in place for business interests, we must have help for the common ordinary citizen.
Those of us with a mortgage have our backs to the wall.
Many cannot afford these outrageous increases in home insurance that Citizens and other companies are charging.
Those of us on fixed incomes stant to lose their homes as they cannot affort these increased premiums.
Of course if we lose our homes, the lenders and speculators are going to have a field day getting homes for pennies on the dollar like we saw happen during the depression.
These insurance companies do not have to recover all that they lost in one year.
The Insurance companies got a good deal by only being a Florida Corp and not being a part of a National corporation thus their risk is in florida and not over a larger part of the risk in the other 49 states.
Something must be done to help everyone and not just another study.

I do hope retired elderly people will be
taken into consideration by the Property
and Casualty Insurance Committee.

With the increases in property values
just to increase taxes is destroying the
American Dream and above all, the
elderly retiree should not have to continue
paying, specially those living on a retirement check.

I planned a second retirement check
and worked for HRS 10 years.  I have
a social security ckeck ($1592.00) and
the State Check after working as an outstanding social worker during all
those years the amount of $493.20   
I retired at age 82 and have quite a
hard time covering expenses so I am
quite concerned for those whose retirement check is $600.00 and believe
me there are all loosing their homes.

There are a lot of expenses for those
retired.....I can no longer clean my
house as I did when younger.  My husband died last year and I
desperatelly need some one to sleep here as I am afraid to be along and
just fall down
and even die alone, but that is costly.

I have never received a cent but worked
very hard to be able to retire with peace
of mind.......There is no such a thing. So
once again I would appreciate you to
help us elderly and retired people to
spend the few years we remain in this
world a little happier.   Taxes and
Insurance is killing us.  Help on those
two big expenses would be highly
appreciated. Loosing my husband"s
retirement check the same month with
payments of both expenses during the
year was quite hard and happened just
at the same time.

Sincerelly,

Silvia V. Vega

The solution to the archaic and unfair insurance rates is to eliminate the county-by-county ratings.  We are all citizens of Florida.  There is no one area of the State more or less susceptible to wind or flood than another.  Spread the risk across the entire State and entire population…..that would provide sufficient wiggle room for insurance companies, insured and insurers a like while eliminating the actuarial mumbo-jumbo and placing everything on an easily understood platform..

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I'm writing to you on behalf of our Lake Point Landing Owners Association in Winter Haven, Florida.  We are having an extremely difficult time in trying to secure liability insurance for our "not for profit" association since our current carrier, Nationwide, Agent David Dershimer, decided they would not renew our policy effective August 21st.  Our premium last year was $5,380.39, the only quote for insurance we have received to date, a bid from "Citizens", cost of $38,000.00 with a $50,000.00 deductible, unbelievable!  We have not given up hope, we are still looking and asking everyone to give us a quote.  We have many owners/tenants that are living on a fixed income and to have to hit them with a "special assessment" to pay the insurance is going to be a financial burden to them, but not a choice that we are going to have.  Governor Bush, we need to do something NOW to address this issue, we do not live on the beaches, we live inland, which had it's fair share of damage from the hurricanes but we just need to be reasonable with the increase.  Is there something we can do to address these issues now, it's beginning to cost to much to say we live in "paradise" which it takes all we make just to survive everyday!
 
Please help us address this problem which not only affects our association but many others.  A reply to our Association President would be greatly appreciated.  Her name and email address:  Charlene "Chary" Peterson, charyp@juno.com.

Subject:	Opposition To Budget Increase In Property Taxes

I oppose any budget increase in property taxes.  The Citizens of Florida have suffered and continue to suffer at the hands of the insurance companies.  This is criminal to the State of Florida to be held hostage by the insurance companies.  The State should conduct an audit of profits, and supposed losses, over the past 10 years by the insurance companies.  They should not be allowed to cancel good patrons and pass these patrons off to high priced insurance carriers of unknown origin.  Who is supporting/financing these high priced carriers?
 
We need relief from budget increases in taxes until the insurance situation is resolved.
 
All candidates for the upcoming election are running on the ticket of taxes and insurance.  Let's see what the Florida government can accomplish before election day, then let's cast our ballot for the candidate who succeeds for the citizens of Florida.
 
Please help all Florida citizens now and not raise any taxes.

Dear Honorable Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush,
 
   Anthony House needs your help. Anthony House is a 501C3 organization in Mt Dora/Zellwood, Florida serving homeless individuals and families from far beyond the Tri-County area. Anthony House is so much more than the “shelter “ it is billed as. Anthony House is a life-changing program serving 65 “Guests”.   At any given time 1/3 are children. Anthony House, beyond dorm-style living accommodations, includes children’s Day Care, playgrounds, library, and Adult Learning Center where paradigms are shifted and lives become focused to re-enter employment and gainfully into community.
   What many aren’t aware of is that Anthony House serves its community offering household goods/furnishings, childcare furnishings, toiletries, and food, support to any who ask.   Being willing to say “I am in need” maybe a stumbling block called denial, but here it is utilized as an invitation. Cooperating in assistance to another may be the lifting of a straw,  which alone had become insurmountable obstacle.
   Being rural Anthony House becomes like the homeless: marginalized. “Out of sight = out of mind”.  With paperwork being the essential element in programs demonstrability instead of the actual work resulting in overcoming problems of which homelessness’ became the critical symptom of, perpetuates the problem. Homelessness’ and hunger are symptoms of other issues that need personal, individual attentions, which  ‘2 hots and a cot’ without bars can never provide. Personally, I have witnessed miracles in lives here. 
In its 22 years of operation, Anthony House continues to hold individuals as our priority over numbers; doing so Anthony House has lost much funding. Many have perfect paperwork with limited works as results. The Anthony House program is simple without frills for further cuttings.  
      Please help Anthony House help those in need ? Having a disability, and having had problems, and been in need where there was no such place, I feel Anthony House is a miracle that needs duplicating. We are not perfect, nor do everything perfectly, but with HIS Grace. Anthony House is a God thing for sure… right from Mathew 25:29,32-46.  Please support us with provision for this to continue.   Anthony House needs food, forks, and funds.
    Come out for a tour; come out August 18 @4:30pm for a Graduation …

Dear Gov Bush,

In October of 2006, we finally realized a dream of ours - to buy a home in Florida to retire to when that time came.

We purchased a home in Seminole Florida (Pinellas County).  

The only homeowners insurance we could get was through Citizens.  It is no special insurance, but because of all of the insurance problems IN YOUR STATE, no one else was writing any homeowners insurance policies.  Seminole, Florida where our house is located, is a NON EVAC zone.  I cannot even comprehend what people in Zones A through D will go through.

Now, in May of this year you signed the above bill.  WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR MIND???  How could you in good conscience let this bill become a law.

You want us "northerners" to come to YOUR STATE, be tourist, spend our money there, buy second homes and you do this.  I am appalled.

Please explain to me how this SB 1980 will HELP ME in any way. 

I am sure you will not reply to this, but I had to inform you that the fact that you signed this into law bothers me alot.

I am a registered republican voter.  Perhaps it is time that I look to other parties to protect my interest.

Subject: Out of Control Home Insurance Premiums

To Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I attended the "Town Hall Meeting" at Merritt Island High School last night Aug. 7,2006  which was sponsored by Florida Today Newspaper and Bob Allen,Rep. District 32.
Home Insurance premiums increases in Florida are out of control. 
At this meeting, Steve Burgess of Tallahassee, representing the State Insurance Consumer Advocate said his recommendation was that State Farm Insurance was eligible for a 9 percent rate increase instead of the 53.7 percent increase that was permitted by the Office of Insurance Regulation.
It is obvious to all that the people who we put our trust in, and vote into office to watch out for our interests are not doing their job. I do not buy for one instant that this is a complex problem. It is not. It is centered around greed.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM NOW ?

Dear Governor:    My name is Brian Bowers,I live in Pinellas County, on 6-14-06, I received a letter from POE Financial Group,(Southern Family Insurance Company) that on 7-1-06 were liquidating and Citizens Property Insurance Corporation took over. The letter states I can not apply for application to Citizens until 30 days prior to my expiration date of my current policy which is(9-27-06), but I have the option to apply elsewhere. Sir, I have applied and this is the problem, I have contacted no less than 8 different insurance agencies and all are only writing for "Citizens". Sir, my home is a single family concrete block construction,containing 2 bath/2 bedrooms/1 car garage,my little matchbox is only 1064 sq. feet, and before POE liquidated my premium was only $631.00 per year. Now the quotes I'm receiving from the multiple agencies is from $2,004.00 to $2,478.00 per year(and it's only Citizens no one else is writing). Sir, I live in a NON Evacuation/NON Flood area and I have never made a claim, how can this be? How can I afford to pay this enormous increase in premiums?(I CAN'T) I do not make a lot of money and neither does my wife(Elaine),we have a 6 year old son(Jerry) to care for. We will be in this house for many years to come because of this,it's not right that I have to pay more than 3 times the premium than I did last year,it's just not right..I think what bothers me the most is POE sends me a letter 15 days before they liquidate. POE knew well in advance and should have informed me in the 2005 policy to begin looking for a new provider,had they done so I might not be in this AWFUL situation today, (I personally think it's criminal,scheming to defraud,POE knew they were in trouble,but we/I didn't) I'm a hard working person who is proud of you as our Governor and your brother, The President of The United States. Please help in this extremely difficult time.

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
Reluctantly, I will add to your burden of messages of insurance woes. Our homeowners policy was renewed  in April with the company we have had for 8 years, Horace Mann. The payment was due on July 1st and I got it there in full, for the year well ahead of time. We felt we were safe for another year. In a letter dated Aug. 5th,  one month into our coverage, we received notice it was cancelled and we would be insured until Nov. 5th. 
 
We were stunned and have spent this week  trying to get coverage as we must protect our investment in our home. Today we located a company  through AAA who would give us coverage for the coming year for $ 4,500. We really can not afford it and I will have to sell stock to pay for it.
 
Our home has been for sale for a year as it is much larger at this point in our lives than we need. It has not sold though we have reduced it 8%. It is among 3 houses on out street for sale and  ours is similar in size  and space as the  others and we have it priced well below the others. The cost of insurance, taxes and interest makes it out of range for most people. We would be willing to reduce it more but have had no offers.
 
We are from Va. and our children are all there. We love Pensacola and want to stay here but it is getting out of the question  to be affordable to live in Florida. Many people we know in our age bracket have gone. I am nearly 76 and my husband nearly 80. He has been retired 16 years and the costs of everything have gone up so much we live a rather spartan life now. Help is impossible to get here and we really can not afford to pay for it. We can continue the yard work  and home repairs for awhile but it isn't so easy now to do it all.
 
Today, we are down and out because we love it here and know we must leave when we can sell our home. I realize we are fortunate that I do own some stock to sell to pay for the homeowners insurance. However, we can not continue to do that.
 
My hope is that someway, somehow, insurance costs can be contained to a more reasonable fee. We had damage from Ivan and were very poorly treated by Horace Mann Ins. For instance, we had 6 estimates for our roof and our insurance paid less than any of them. We found them so unpleasant to deal with we paid for much ourselves  rather than fight with them. When Dennis came along we had a more modest amount of damage, below our figure of deductible which is between $5,000 & 6,000 . We had that to pay and our pad for unusual and unexpected expenses was  exhausted.
 
I would appreciate any efforts  in controlling insurance costs you could make on behalf of those of us who are old, possibly goofy, not so well off financially as we   once were. It makes me very sad to accept the fact that we will have to leave this lovely area.
 
Thank you for your consideration,

Dear Mr. Bush,

I normally do not send notes like this as I know how busy you must be 
but something has to be done about the insurance prices here in 
Florida.  I just got my auto ins. renewal notice and it has gone up 
$254 a year. I have had same ins. for 34 years, no claims and no 
tickets and when I asked why I was given the same story every one is 
using for everything. The storms have put so much burden and expense on 
the ins. companies etc.  It seems to be a blanket excuse for raising 
the rates on everything. I drive my car about 10,000 miles a year. I 
hate so see my homeowners ins. which is due to come next month.
Thank you for listening and hope we get some relief soon.  I am a 
native Floridian and go back many generations and this is just hard to 
take.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I would appreciate if you can take a moment to read my concern.

 

First I want to thank you so much for your hard work in the State of Florida.  

 

This is related to the chaotic topic of Home Owners’ Insurance that we as residents are undergoing.

 

I live in Coral Springs – I was paying $3,300 a year for my insurance.  The company I had went out of business.  My renewal date is August 30th 2006. I have been called by the agent, saying that the renewal is coming up and that I am with Citizens now and the cost is  $6,800.  

 

I escrow for my home owners insurance during the year.  And I have escrowed an extra 700 because I thought due to the hurricanes that it was going to go up.  But not double! This was not in my budget.  Also, these companies are not giving any payment plans.  In my case, they want the money on the 30th of August and the rest 30 days after.

 

This is a matter of what is legal and fair.  How is it possible for insurance companies to do that? That doesn’t even sound legal to me.

 

I move to Florida 10 years ago.  Sadly, I tell you that living here is overrated.

 

Besides that the cost of living doesn’t match the salaries at all!  I am a single mother trying to earn a living and it is never enough with the cost of everything rising.

 

Please I really hope that you look into this.  

 

This is a desperate situation. In my case, I will have to put $2800 in a credit card – paying almost 17%.  

 

I never made a claim – this raise should not be allowed.

 

Thank you for your time.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:
   I read where the first day of the insurance reform committee was taken up discussing the matching funds program It was interesting to note that there wasn't even one comment reported that this program is for the richer Floridian. Not one member stopped to say wait a minute, this program doesn't apply to the less financially fortunate Floridian, who can't even afford the uncalled for exhorbitant homeowner's insurance premium never mind paying for repairs. Not one of them showed the common sense to realize that the program is stacked to favor the rich as only the rich can take advantage of it.
   I've been a Republican for over 50 years, but I have to say that Jeb Bush is a failure; he's failed in the only real crisis Florida has faced in his near 8 years in office. 
   The home resale market has collapsed. Prices are going to tumble,and even after they do, it is doubtful the market real estate will recover. Foreclosures have already tripled, and they are still multiplying while the Governor's hand picked committee lauds a program that is useless to the little guy. 
   I spent over 35 years in the insurance field as an underwriter, consultant and an insurance purchaser for a very large corporation, and I'll tell you that there is no way the private insurance industry is retuning to Florida unless the insurers can cherry pick and charge even higher premiums. This Governor, by his inability to see and do what s necessary, is responsible for the financial destruction of the lives of thousands of Floridians, and before someone is elected who will do what is right, millions of lives will be destroyed.
   There is only one viable answer, and it must be done quickly before more lives are ruined along with the state's economy. The State must adopt a State Catastrophe Property Insurance Program with a single per $1,000 premium rate based on insured value and applicable througout the state regardless of area or region. It is the only way to spread the risk so everyone has a chance of affording to pay the premium. The insurers can return and right their ordinary homeowner's policy, and they could also collect the premiums and pay the claims of the Catastrophe Program for a fee.
   I'll predict that if this isn't done Florida will not solve the crisis, and ruin will be upon millions of us.
   Sincerely yours, Michael Fitzpatrick

I am not sure HOW exactly I can contribute.  I know we need a cap on rates.  We need to hold companies accountable and lock them into a time commitment and dollar amount they will spend, and that they will write insurance in FL without cancelling people for stated amount of time. They must cover wind and sinkholes in all counties and offer sinkhole buyback coverage where it's omitted.  If you manufacturer a home you should provide a company to the people who will cover that risk and who will allow independant agents to write x amount of policies per zip code.   Insurance companies base rates on our credit but many times there are mitigating circumstances to why our credit isn't a 700 score (Divorce, illness, identity theft....etc etc.).  MORE people would be insured in their autos, homes, renters IF it were affordable.  We as Americans have this mindset that if it goes wrong there will be our Governor or President with their wallet open to help.  WRONG! I can say IF a Katrina were to happen here now, many would watch TV all over the nation and say those idiots why didn't they get insurance? Now they want a donation.  If we as Americans can send scads of money to tsunami victims in a country many did not know existed and many could not even find on a map before that tragedy why we can’t fix a problem in our very home.  We helped heal NY after 911 (being from Jersey, with my family working in NYC and having friends who worked in the Pentagon that was horrific time for me).  Our reinsurance is from overseas and they have tremendously hiked their rates to our insurance companies who pass on that to us the ones in need!  Basically it's the reinsurance holding companies to extreme high rates and companies holding us hostage.  California many states have huge losses yearly and they rates are not like ours.   I'm a single mom, who started her own insurance agency with no capitol just a passion to stay here and make it better for my children financially. To be a role model for my own children.  To show them a single mom can do this. I love what I do.  I love teaching people how insurance works.  I have had no income for 3 yrs.  I have a dream and now I face losing my home, my business my children’s future because of insurance rates alone. I and my kid’s are a breath away from destitute but because I and my kids had a dream and had a desire to make a new way for us with one insurance bill we’ll lose everything. I face tears across my desk when giving quotes. To have mature, educated adults decide to or pay for food and medicine or pay for insurance.  It’s not just home insurance it’s across the board!  I will petition, I will sit on a committee, I will march from here to Tallahassee on foot (not run like Jeff Dawsy, I'll walk instead).  I hate public speaking (but I will do it) I want NO advertising for me or my business.  I want to help fix this nightmare for myself, you and my community.  I've worked since I was 9 yrs old and I will continue.  I absolutely LOVE where I live and I am proud to be raising my children here.  I am the epitome of they said it can't be done I have struggled and worked far too hard to quit now.  I'm a role model to my daughter and my son who work just as hard and carry me when I want to give up.  You all represent ME and my community, but are you all a hair’s breathe from losing absolutely everything you worked for and paid for and earned by insurance rates?

 

 Florida's loss I guess. Tell me how I can help rectify this please.  This needs to be EVERYONE’S top priority!

Hello Lt Governor,
I was born in Tampa, Fl and have been gone from the state due to job transfers for 6 years. We returned to Florida to help take care of elderly parents and soon to be grandchildren.   We can not afford to stay here.  We have been looking at homes to buy cash but we can not afford the homeowners insurance and then taxes. On a $300,000 home the insurance will be $500 a month on top of taxes.
Something has to be done or you will have no one living in Florida.  How do minimun wage earners afford to live here and protect their families? If Mr. Bush wants to leave a lasting legacy, all he has to do is be the one who makes insurance affordable for everyone, not just the rich.
It is sad to think we will have to relocate back to Georgia or TN and not see our grandchildren or help care for elderly parents, but the State of Florida is not leaving us any options.

Please look into the possibility  to require any insurance company 
doing business in Fla. to at least offer a policy for home owners that 
may exclude hurricane losses but at least would help low income  and 
others to get some protection for losses like fire etc. As the rates 
now are not affordable and a very large no of people no longer carry 
any insurance as we can't afford the rates. Thanks

 Dear Governor “Jeb” Bush ,                                                     August 11, 2006
 
   Yesterday I phoned your offices and was told to put this request in writing … Though I could lather it with statements of how many, in fact most all, Floridians and teachers will be sad to see your term come to an end, I know it is not the end of your politicals . Rest, and come back strong sir! You have accomplished much.
   As an AmeriCorps*VISTA member in my third year enlistment,  I feel it my duty to alert you to a severe need in a project you are fond of : ANTHONY HOUSE INC of Zellwood, Florida. 
   Seems as Anthony House continues to hold individuals as our priority over numbers, we have lost much funding. As our Case Manager is not a college graduate, but is the most successful in the position than her predecessors of late years, that also cost Anthony House further funding.
   As the economic needs to succeed increase, even with a stronger economy, many find themselves borderline and at-risk of losing homes.  The very organizations that administer funding are holding paperwork increases more important than direct services.  As you are well aware, homelessness’ and hunger are symptoms of other issues that need the personal, individual attentions, not just ‘2 hots and a cot’ without bars can ever provide. You know the Anthony House program and the many facets it includes don’t leave much room for savings anywhere.  I testify to miracles I have witnessed here. 
 
   There was recently a news article with headlines that you have 53 million dollars in cash available.  Not knowing what that means, or the control over such an announcement of funds you may have, forgive my coming to the point here. “Anthony House has no money at this time”.  AmeriCorps will remain, as will several stalwarts, but the lights, water, etc.  Is there a way you can declare us a State of Emergency ? Is there a way you can secure funding for this noble project?
 
   With all prayers for you and yours, all respect for better protocol to such request, I yield to your wisdom and authority asking simply “Please help Anthony House”? Having a disability, and having had problems, and been in need where there was no such place, I feel Anthony House is a miracle that needs duplicating. Now in it’s 22nd year, we are not perfect, nor do everything perfectly, but with HIS Grace. Anthony House is a God thing for sure… right from Mathew 25:29,32-46.  Please support us with your word and provision for this to continue ? There are always 65 persons as “Guests” here, one third of whom are children.

Subject:	Homeowner's Insurance

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I have always tried to be the best person I can be and attend to the needs of others.  At this moment in time, I need help.  My husband and I have lived in Florida for 15 years in two different homes.  We have had our homeowner's insurance cancelled twice, once in each home.  We have never had a claim on either home.
 
Now, because we still have a mortgage we are required to attain homeowner's insurance.  We have no other option than Citizen's Insurance as our home was built in 1959.  Last year's bill was $917.00 from Clarendon (Tower Hill who are no longer insuring people in Florida), now we are told (and regardless of the fact that it has been updated with hurricane protection), our bill for this year with Citizen's will be $3,400.00!!!  This is outrageous!!  
 
I retired last year as a school secretary and my husband will be retiring in a couple of years (from the Agency for Health Care Administration - you know he doesn't make much money), we aren't sure how in the world we will come up with that kind of money by September 30, 2006.  Isn't there anything that can be done to cut out this insanity?  There are people worse off than we are, and that just is so wrong.
 
This is an election year, so I would guess that our only recourse is to vote for the person who really cares about people and their issues.  We always try to do that, but it seems that once in office, they change their ideals.  Very sad indeed.
 
Thank you for your time, and I pray that you and all the other legislators who allowed this to come about, will be able to look at yourselves in the mirror.

Jeb,

Why would you allow these ridicules insurance rate increases? How are us low-middle class families supposed to pay these prices? Are you trying to stick it to your constituents before you leave office? I do not intend to sound so mean, but this is what I have been hearing. PLEASE DO SOMETHING FAST TO HELP US. Please call a special session and lower these insurance rates.

 

I am a 31 year old single mother of a 12 and 15 year old. I have raised both of my children on my on since they were babies. I am really in a bind. I just received my new mortgage coupons and I was so shocked. My premium went up to $879.77 a MONTH. My actual mortgage is $279.99 with $600.00 a year for taxes and the rest in Home owners Insurance. As you know my boss (at my full-time job) will not give me a $400.00 a month raise so I am going to have to get a part-time job just to pay for homeowners insurance. Mean while my kid's father is on section 8 housing enjoying his bigscreen TV (with cable), high-speed internet and a brand new playstation 3. Yet he has not paid my children $1.00 for child support in over a year. Kay Howell is working on this but where is the justice. I am fortunate to have a good paying job. I work very hard. As you know the school year is coming up in just a few weeks and I have to find the money to get my children school clothes plus pay for all of their supplies. How I am supposed to do all of this plus pay my mortgage. Why was the insurance increase allowed. Didn't you guys think that most of us low to  middle income families would not be able to afford increases like this. In 2004 I was paying $407.00 a month for my mortgage. Now I pay almost $900.00 OOUUUUUCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHH. I was a teenager when I had my children, I finished High School, got a business certificate, received an A.S. Degree and bought my house when I was 22. I think I did darn well for myself and my kids. I might have been lucky enough to have received a TOTAL  of $3000.00 form my ex for childsupport. (this would be the total for the past 15 years) $3000.00 may even be stretching it. I guess back to the point. We have laws against price gouging, but we are allowed to be gouged if the government says it is ok. What am I supposed to do. I can't eve qualify for reduced lunch for my kids.  I just spoke with my boss who lives in the Jacksonville area (on a private beach) he his only paying $500.00 a year for insurance. Why am I paying 6x that amount? I do not live in a flood zone, ar an erea that has had damage from storms. Something is terribley wrong.

Dear Governor Bush:  I know that your office has most likely been deluged with a new round of Insurance “Refusniks” these I call companies who have milked their customers for better than 20 or 30 years and have recently become un insured as the companies have decided to drop them for no other reason that THE HOME HAS MOST PROBABLY AGED This is a paradoxical conundrum. It has left many homeowners, (many retired individuals and families in danger of having their mortgages literally pulled on them because mortgage placement requires Insuring the lender’s risk which is normal and understandable. My next door neighbor has had to get a loan to finance his new premium because these “new” companies require insurance in advance, (not current-so that the banks cannot even assist in collecting the premiums for these companies) More over most banks, despite having a fiduciary to the borrower, have not taken the position of defending their clients and have not notified them of receiving notice from the carrier. Moreover the recent quotes we received were 3X the initial premiums-When will our State Insurance department make an honorable commitment to the constituent base rather than favor the deleterious actions of these companies who shared nothing when they made zillions (pre’92) 

What and when are you going to do to help the people of this state that are compelled to face a problem which is not of their making and it appears that the state has buried it’s head in the sand and has offered no help to the citizenry. What say you Mr. Governor? Are you going to commit to an act of selflessness that may inspire a legacy towards your term in office

Dear Governor Bush:

 

     We have been following, and appreciate, your efforts with regard to the business property insurance situation.  Our business property coverage was going to be “non-renewed” in October of 2004, however due to your efforts the insurer had to renew our coverage for six months, to allow us to find another insurer.  We did, at a cost of $95,327.90.  About a 50% increase.

 

     This year, our premium more than doubled, to $196,269.88, and we were told that we were fortunate to get the coverage.  We’ve never filed a claim, yet we were turned down by twenty-one companies.   We don’t know how we will be able to pay the premium next year....if we can find coverage.

 

     Something has to be done and we are pleased with your involvement.

 

                                         Sincerely,

I understand all that you are saying in your email in answer to my questions however it does not address my real questions.  If newcomers viving for your office can promise to call these insurance companies on the carpet, then why can't our present governor do likewise now.  My insurance should not hav been increased 2-3 times in the same year.  I don't think they should have the ability to price individuals out of their homes.  They should have someone to answer to and be governed by.  They should not have to ability to raise their prices on individuals that have never even used their policies.  It is no secret that the insurance companies have plenty of money and they insist you pay you policy and pay it on time, however when you need it, they are quite slow to pay, if at all.  I am quite disappointed that these companies can cause individuals to lose their homes because they are priced out of ownership.  Is there nothing you can do to help us??  I should not have to struggle to keep my home at this venue in my life, I am 65 years old and there should be something your office can do to help us.  My housenote jumped from $743,69 to $1,159.00 (can you imagine).  I was just being able to pay that due to refinancing my home to lower my housenote each month.  Please, please, please help me.

Subject: Concerns regarding homeowner's insurance


Dear Friend:
 
Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding homeowner’s insurance.  Governor Bush appreciates your views and asked me to respond on his behalf. 
 
As a result of the past hurricane seasons, property insurance rates have increased.  The Governor knows this is a challenging reality for homeowners, businesses, and local governments, but understands increased rates are a common market reaction to the risk associated with insuring homes and businesses in Florida at a time when so much damage was caused by recent hurricanes.  
 
Governor Bush believes the underlying problems in the property insurance market can be resolved by encouraging mitigation of homes and buildings to make them more resistant to wind damage, and by encouraging private insurance companies to underwrite more of the state’s wind risk.  This would minimize the number of policies and the amount of claims exposure for Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens), the state’s insurer of last resort.  Citizens covers those who cannot obtain property insurance from the private market.     
 
On May 16, 2006, Governor Bush signed Senate Bill 1980 into law.  This bill provides policy reforms and funding to stabilize and improve the property insurance market.  Senate Bill 1980 assists private insurance companies with an Insurance Capital Build-up Incentive Program allowing private insurance companies to underwrite more policies in Florida.  The bill provides funding for free home inspections and grants for homeowners who choose to reinforce their homes against wind damage through the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program.  It also provides funding to offset the deficit of Citizens, reducing assessments to homeowners, and provides reforms to prevent future Citizens’ assessments.  Those with internet access can view the complete text of the bill online by typing in the bill number on the Senate’s homepage at www.flsenate.gov.
 
Governor Bush believes that long-term reforms are necessary to repair the underlying problems that exist in the insurance market.  The Governor created the “Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee” to address these important issues.  This Executive Order is online at: www.flgov.com/executive_orders.
 
Thank you again for writing.  Governor Bush wants to know how Floridians feel about the many critical issues we face and encourages you to share your views with your local legislative delegation.  Please be assured that the Governor will keep your ideas in mind as he forms policy for addressing these concerns.  
 
 
Sincerely,
L. Wright
Aide to the Governor

I am writing to you regarding the Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee.

 

I have noted with great chagrin that the new Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program is only available to those qualified individuals that have property with an insured value less than $500,000.  Unfortunately, I am one of those Floridians with an 18 yr. old house that originally cost less than $400K and has now risen in value beyond $500K.  I am also one of those Floridians who is retired, “house rich” and “cash flow conscious” on a fixed income.  There is a real need to improve the hurricane readiness of my home but I don’t have the budget to afford large expenditures.

 

I urge your committee to evaluate a recommendation for the FL Legislature to amend this program in 2007 to include homes with higher insured values.  There are a lot of other cash strapped retirees who are in similar situations.

 

Thank you.

Subject:	Property Insurance Costs solution

Hello Ms. Jennings. My name is Robert Vail. I live in Titusville in Brevard Florida. I am retired from the US Army and now work for the State with the Department of Revenue. I too have begun to suffer under the ever increasing Property Insurance premium. I heard the other day about a proposed solution where the State covers the first $100,000.00 in covered damages. I think this is a novel idea and wish to submit my plan based on this proposal. 

I too am disgruntled beyond belief at my continually increasing homeowners insurance premiums. I purchased my 1651 square foot home in 1997 for the sum of $92,000.00. My insurance premium was only $567.00 per year, including hurricane insurance, and with a $500.00 deductible. When my annual renewal goes into effect on August 25, 2006, my premium will exceed $2500.00, and I have a 2% deductible on a home worth $192,200.00.

The current crisis in the insurance industry will not be solved at the State level. We must have Federal Government intervention. And their only way to do that is to have the Federal Government create a "Federal Hurricane insurance" plan, similar to Federal Flood insurance. 

With a Federal Hurricane Insurance policy, the insurance companies then only need to sell regular casualty insurance. This will immediately and substantially lower premiums. With the shared cost of the Federal Hurricane Insurance by the Insurance companies, the homeowner, the Federal Government and the State Government, premiums for this insurance, if combined with regular insurance, would show a reasonable total reduction in premiums.

With a 1/2% increase in the State sales tax, the State can generate in excess of $102,000,000.00 per year towards this plan. If all of the States along the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast were to do the same, one can only imagine the amount of money generated toward this program. 

Participation in this program will of course, be voluntary, but who wouldn't want to be a part of it? To continue selling Hurricane insurance by the current methods is no longer viable. We must make a bold and dramatic change, if we don't want to see a migration from Florida similar to the Great Dust bowl migration during the depression. It's getting to be such that only high income people will be able to afford to live in Florida.

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

Florida is loosing ground daily in our economy.  As a Realtor,  I am out daily with people who need to sell their homes and have to relocate out of our state due to the high costs of insurance for homes and businesses.  I also have buyers who fall out of a home purchase due to the fact that for a property "assessed"  for $85,000, not including the land, they are having to pay over $3500 a year to insure their new home.  Do you realize that the insurance payment is over $290.00 a month.  And that is over half of what they are paying for their monthly mortgage payment on a note for $110,000 with 20% down.   At this rate, if insurance were not needed they could replace their roof in a matter of two years with the amount they will spend for insurance and have some money left over to boot.

My "Wind Insurance"  policy, on my previous home, went from $250 a year in 2004 to over $1200 in 2006 do you realize that is a 480% increase in 2 years?  And that policy had "0" Contents coverage.



We can not wait until next year to resolve this issue.  We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately.


If we don't address this problem now, it will be more costlier and harder to resolve next year.  Please consider the loss in revenue the state will realize from doc stamps on mortgages and on the deed transfer.  If sales are down, so will revenue in these areas and many others.  Can the state afford this loss of revenue?


As a Licensed Realtor we have responsibilities to protect our clients as should you to your constituents.  The insurance companies have lobbyists. What do the citizens of this state have if we do not have the government officials who are elected by us to help protect us?  All you hear are the lobbyists; it's time to listen to the people.  And the people are screaming for HELP!!!



Please call a special session now to get working on this situation.  To delay is costly to everyone.

Sincerely,

Dear Lt. Gov. Jennings:   I hear you are leading an insurance meeting.   Well I wish you well but it may be to late for us.  We moved to Florida several years ago and built a nice middle class home.  Due to insurance cost, increasing property taxes, water and sewer assessments, etc. it looks like we will be leaving Florida soon.   The insurance companies are ridiculous.  They cry wolf about not making any money.  My suggestion is tell them to take a hike and if they don't want to write insurance at reasonable rates they should leave Florida, that includes all lines of their insurance.
 
What happened to the premiums all those years without major hurricances. In their pockets.  The state should adopt the Democrats $100,000 state responsbility, raise the sales tax a penny, increase tourist taxes since they enjoy the benefit of our weather but do not pay for the insurance.   Oh well I am sure the politicans will kill the goose that laid the golden egg.  Florida is headed to big problems.   I wish the little guy was a big a concern for politicans as the monied people.   I am a Republican but I intend to vote for any non incumbent who has created for fostered this mess.

I had homeowners insurance with Poe. I knew, I was going to be cancelled, and put under Citizens insurance, in October of this year. I found insurance with Nation Wide in June. I cancelled my insurance with Poe/Citizens. I received my refund. The only thing, I am upset about, They kept a $100.00 of my refund, and now I have to pay them 2% at the end of the year as all homeowners do. I'm being double charged by the State ran insurance company. I think this is very shady. They are cheating people left and right. I'd like to now why they are getting away with this. Can your office check into this. It's not so much the money it's the principal of the whole thing. My home address 10330 Tarragon Drive. Riverview, Florida 33569. Thanking You in advance.

Dear Governor Bush:

Florida is loosing ground daily in our economy.  As a Realtor,  I am out daily with people who need to sell their homes and have to relocate out of our state due to the high costs of insurance for homes and businesses.  I also have buyers who fall out of a home purchase due to the fact that for a property "assessed"  for $85,000, not including the land, they are having to pay over $3500 a year to insure their new home.  Do you realize that the insurance payment is over $290.00 a month.  And that is over half of what they are paying for their monthly mortgage payment on a note for $110,000 with 20% down.   At this rate, if insurance were not needed they could replace their roof in a matter of two years with the amount they will spend for insurance and have some money left over to boot.

My "Wind Insurance"  policy, on my previous home, went from $250 a year in 2004 to over $1200 in 2006 do you realize that is a 480% increase in 2 years?  And that policy had "0" Contents coverage.



We can not wait until next year to resolve this issue.  We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately.


If we don't address this problem now, it will be more costlier and harder to resolve next year.  Please consider the loss in revenue the state will realize from doc stamps on mortgages and on the deed transfer.  If sales are down, so will revenue in these areas and many others.  Can the state afford this loss of revenue?


As a Licensed Realtor we have responsibilities to protect our clients as should you to your constituents.  The insurance companies have lobbyists. What do the citizens of this state have if we do not have the government officials who are elected by us to help protect us?  All you hear are the lobbyists; it's time to listen to the people.  And the people are screaming for HELP!!!



Please call a special session now to get working on this situation.  To delay is costly to everyone.

Sincerely,

Subject:	A serious solution to a serious hurricane insurance problem

Importance:	High

We Floridians have 2 major problems that need to be solved quickly to
insure the economic viability of this growing state.
They can both be solved simultaneously with compromise legislation.

1.    Our coastal counties need to have a stable insurance pool
available.  This can be done with a quasi government sponsored and
authorized private reinsurance company.  Private insurers should be
required to insure for windstorm damage only for the top 20% of the
total coverage.  They would set a standard deductible amount of  a flat
$ amount, say $5,000 for windstorm damage.   The State would set
underwriting standards required to be followed by insurers.  For
example, a grid would be established setting standard rates for coverage
for a pool cage or a roof based on age and standards under which they
were built.   The state reinsurance company would take the rest of the
coverage and negotiate standard payment rates and regulate and schedule
approved vendors.   This company would take over the actual restoration
and make payments directly to contractors.   This would eliminate the
huge waste of time and money resulting from hundreds of thousands of
unquailified insureds suddenly becoming general contractors.
This company would be funded by a) payment of reasonable premiums
actuarily computed over a very long period of time.  (Our current
insurance coverage problems stem from carriers reacting to isolated
catastrophes influenced by their desire to please stockholders.) and b)
local real estate taxes.

2.  Local real estate taxes would, in turn, be aided by a much needed
revision of the Save Our Homes Amendment.   The huge inequities of this
concept discourage new development of all kinds and penalize commercial
property owners.   The initial motivation for this terrible idea stemmed
from the cries of pensioners on fixed incomes that did not rise as much
as local taxes.   The 3% cap was a naive attempt to corral local tax
spending and to protect these retirees, so that they didn't have to move
to escape unaffordable taxes.  The reality is, that while real estate
values are going up, the quality and cost of effective government
budgets have been rising in step.   Rather than giving away thousands of
dollars of tax dollars at the expense of non homestead taxpayers, these
excess taxes should be DEFERRED and collected on the resale of the home
with interest!  After all, if it is this excessively rising valuation
that caused the dreaded tax increases.  Why shouldn't those windfall
beneficiaries repay their fair share of that boon to the society that
gave them the opportunity for that wealth creation?

I would appreciate staff's careful consideration of this concept and
response to this email.

You know what I received in the mail today......another assessment
for flood insurance increase from A&M Management through Goldman/Juda.

They did not wait long after the you signed off on the bill!

All State has told me they have to take 3 weeks to evaluate my claim
for assessments. I do not expect much help since you have just given
Insurance companies Carte Blance before you leave office.

You, Sir, have taken the money from Insurance Companies and now running out!
You, Sir, have Screwed every home owner, condo owner in the State of
Florida! And you have the nerve to call it My Florida!

I will, of course, be in touch with Ms Carroll for help since she was hired
by you after you fired Mr. Rizzo (who was working for unit owners) I am sure
I will get help from her.........NOT!

What you just did, signing off a bill which gives Insurance Companies
the right to increase our rates. up to 10% with NO state regulation makes
me sick to my stomach!

I AM OUTRAGED!

Subject:	Insurance Crisis

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Thank you for the opportunity to contact you regarding the insurance crisis in south Florida. We thank you for your work done so far on this subject and, as residents in this area who have experienced first-hand the wrath of hurricanes, we implore you, and all of our legislators, to continue to work toward a solution which will ease the insurance premium burden on your constituents.  

 

A bit of personal insurance history--State Farm notified our condominium association with over 1000 residents that as of the end of February, 2007, they will be cancelling our policy and that we will be insured by Citizens effective March, 2007 at a premium of $856,000 (our 2006 premium with State Farm was $156,000)!!  We were also told that Citizens is our only option, and after doing some investigation on our own, our Board has concluded that is in fact true. It's hard to accept an increase of this magnitude knowing that it will have a major impact on some of our more senior residents, in particular, living on fixed incomes.  But we have come to the realization that we must accept it and pay it in order to have coverage.  

 

Some of our residents have suggested that we "self-insure"--and after researching this idea we find that it is not a viable option.  But their main argument is "how will Citizens, in the event of a major hurricane in south Florida, be able to cover damages for their thousands and thousands of policyholders"??

 

Please continue to keep insurance in south Florida as a priority, working toward some relief to this problem.  Thank you for listening! 

 

Sincerely, 

 

Eleanor and Mal Roach

I think that windstorm and flood Insurance could be completely elliminated with a required National Disaster Insurance rider on our homeowners and business Insurance policy. It seems like almost every state lately has been hit with some sort of disaster. Floods, hurricanes, fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, ice storms, blizzards,and even events like 911 could all be funded by a natural disaster insurance.If every homeowners had  to  pay 100 to 300 dollars per policy per year it would take away not only the problem of  not being covered for an unseen event, but it would take some of the burden off of the federal government. If all properties across the U.S. had to contribute;  the amount of  money in the fund would be great. The payments could go to a separate federal fund with access only being used by your Insurance agent. The Insurance agents could be paid by a fee or percentage tacked onto your policy yearly --say 50 dollars a year or a percentage of your policy for their work done on your behalf.

Subject:	HARDENED HOME DON'T IMPRESS  HARD HEARTED INSURANCE COMPANIES!

Dear Sirs and Madam:
 
As one who has " HURRICANE HARDENED HER HOUSE", I read with great amusement the latest scheme to fix the insurance problem by subsidizing HOUSE HARDENING.
 
Short term it will keep the building industry happy, the state government  officials will be happy looking like heros dishing out the dough, and even the homeowners will think "Hardening" their house will help them avoid the crisis of non-renewal.  Wrong! 
 
As one who has spent thousands of dollars upgrading and hardening her house, to meet or exceed current building hurricane standards; which includes, hurricane strappings and buckets on trusses, 6 nails, per shingle, 8" re-bar reinforced poured concrete walls, 200 mph impact resistant glass, and the latest Hurricane Shutters; I have been non-renewed.  My insurance company does not care what improvements I have done to my home, they only know it is located in Florida and because insurance companies can't get reinsurance (to spread their risk) they want out of Florida.
 
Maybe we all need to harden our homes and only rely on insurance for theft, and fire.  Liability the next looming crisis is another story.

I read an article on the first meeting of this committee and it seems the homeowner is expected to shoulder the biggest part of the property insurance mess by fortifying their homes.  As the owner of a condo whose association has been forced into Citizens, I don't believe we owners have even this option.  Since there are thousands of condo associations in Florida, I would hope your committee would address our concerns.  Most of the residents living in condos are seniors on fixed income.  This insurance crisis is very hard on us and I haven't seen anything that indicates anyone is looking out for our interests.

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

I just got off the phone with my homeowner's insurance company, State Farm.  I found out today that in November 2007 my homeowner's insurance will go from $2,300 per year to $6,006 per year.  My annual salary is not increasing that much therefore I can not afford such an increase.

 

I am a single mother of a child who will start college in the fall of 2007. I have worked at the same company for 19 years and was very proud that I purchased my own home years ago.  Because the insurance is going up so much I am now faced with a dilemma.  If I keep my house I have to get a second job to cover the $300 plus dollars a month that my insurance is going up or I can sell my home and move into rental property.  Even rental properties are going up because the owner's insurance is also rising.  I haven't worked this hard for nothing. I live in a modest home (40 years old) well within my means but I will be forced to go back to a time where I was just starting out renting an apartment or living with my mother.

 

Something must be done. Being 41 years old I have some options.  What about the elderly people that are on fixed incomes?

Hi,

I know it’s too late to do anything but has anyone ever thought to look at sliding scale factor for both taxes and insurance?  If age, income and # in household were to be considered I think we could come up with a better plan so we don’t have to leave florida.  But then again if all the people who are in low paying jobs and less expensive houses left the new ones coming in would have deeper pockets is that the real plan?

Toni,

I just called the Governor’s office twice and when I asked to talk to someone about what is being done about the Property Insurance Crises they transferred me to the Financial services office. When I called back she said that there was no one there I could speak to – perhaps he needs an aide. 

 

We truly appreciate your detailed response to our last e-mail.

 

Since I first e-mailed you the situation has gotten much worse. The average homeowner who has been canceled and cannot get reasonable property Insurance, and cannot go without Insurance without being foreclosed upon by their Mortgage Company.

 

The millions of Floridians whose jobs are affected by the Housing markets are quickly losing their business and many will soon be Bankrupt.  This affects every person employed in the Construction, Real Estate, Mortgage, Title, Inspections, etc.

 

The time to call special sessions is now before it is too late. Even if we cannot find all of the solutions we can mitigate, offset, or delay some of the pain until Long term solutions can be found. This is not a new problem and we have had almost a year to research the problem and weigh the solutions.

 

What can we do to be heard?

Importance:	High

Dear Mr. Bush, 
 
It is with a great sense of urgency that I send you this correspondence.  We have been in business for over 20 years in the same local area.  As any business expects increases for things such as materials, wages and insurance but the rate at which our current insurance rates have skyrocketed is inconceivable.  In doing our part, I have recently completed a survey for the Office of Insurance Regulation as was forwarded to me by our Pasco Economic Development Council with regard to a study that they are currently reviewing.  
 
A large area of concern of mine is that rate increases in our state need to be approved before an insurer can increase costs.  If they've already been approved, why now do you form a group to complete a study on what the average business is paying and whether or not they are able to locate adequate and affordable insurance?  Shouldn't this be done during a time frame where an insurance company is requesting a rate hike?  In addition, how can a hike such as the ones that we are coming across now be passed?  How can you expect Floridian's to be able to pay the increasing insurance rates on the salaries that Florida's jobs carry?  Now is not the time to form a study group to see what's wrong with this picture, at this point it's too late.  Our insurance is at a non-renewal stage as of the end of this month, time is not something that we have.  We are now very rapidly searching different insurers through multiple avenues in order to obtain the coverage that we need to run our business.  Unfortunately, the rates in which we are looking at for through these insurers are at over a 100% increase in comparison to our costs last year!  In addition, they are NOT writing wind coverage for our building.  No wind coverage??  How am I supposed to protect my business and it's assets without wind coverage?  Metal buildings are not coverable for wind damage, but yet let's approve them and use them for industrial purposes all over the region.  Understandable, mother nature is very unpredictable and the wrath of what we saw in our state last year was that like no other.  As with any summer storm in our state, the driving force behind the rain is the wind.  It's the wind that forces down powerlines.  It's the wind that blows roof's off.  It's the wind that carries debris.  How is it possible to exclude the one thing that is the main reason for destruction?  Every year businesses struggle with profits and losses.  Sometimes you have a great year and you can show a profit.  Other years, times are tough and maybe you show a loss, but should you get to raise your prices by over 100% when you do experience a loss?  If I did this in my field, I'd be out of business if I weren't a Monopoly.  Maybe that's the key here, it's that once you have a niche and obtain a monopoly of sorts, you can write your own ticket.  Maybe if you pay enough money to the campaigns of those who run for office in this state, you can get the votes to swing your way.  Support the American dream.  The dream to be your own boss, to do right by and to others, the land of opportunity.  It's sad that in the state of Florida, the reality is that the dream is just that... a dream.  
 
I would hope that you would end your term as Governor on the same note that carried you into office.  Your passion for getting the job done, doing what's right for our State and its residents.  We need a Governor who will continue to work as hard for us now as he did on day #1.  Please do not leave this issue to the next guy in line for the job.  This is a problem that needs immediate attention and immediate resolution.  Local businesses are looking to you for leadership and strength in a time where it seems it's easier to just give up.

Never had a claim or asked for anything. At this rate my insurance payments will be more than my mortgage payment next year. If I am really unlucky I will get dropped and put into citizens who made a deal with the devil to charge more than what the devil was charging for insurance.

I have no doubt you have had several emails addressing this subject but I just wanted to add my voice to the many.  My homeowners insurance was cancelled due to “Reduction in Catastrophe Exposure”, as I am sure many other homes have been.  My new quote from Citizens has increased 400%.  I have been unable to find another carrier to insure my home so I am forced to pay these thieves this money!  I have lived in my home for 10 years; I have never been affected by a hurricane and never had a claim.  I live in a “non-evacuation zone” and I cannot believe I am being ripped off like this.

Dear Ms. Phillips,

 

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding homeowner’s insurance.  Governor Bush appreciates your views and asked me to respond on his behalf. 

 

As a result of the past hurricane seasons, property insurance rates have increased.  The Governor knows this is a challenging reality for homeowners, businesses, and local governments, but understands increased rates are a common market reaction to the risk associated with insuring homes and businesses in Florida at a time when so much damage was caused by recent hurricanes.  

 

Governor Bush believes the underlying problems in the property insurance market can be resolved by encouraging mitigation of homes and buildings to make them more resistant to wind damage, and by encouraging private insurance companies to underwrite more of the state’s wind risk.  This would minimize the number of policies and the amount of claims exposure for Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens), the state’s insurer of last resort.  Citizens covers those who cannot obtain property insurance from the private market.     

 

Governor Bush recently signed Senate Bill 1980 providing policy reforms and funding intended to stabilize and enhance the property insurance market.  The Governor believes this legislation is a good first step at resolving the underlying problems of Florida’s property insurance market but recognizes that more far-reaching changes are required to stimulate affordable private alternatives to the unsustainable growth rate of public insurance and reinsurance.

 

Governor Bush believes that long-term reforms are necessary to repair the underlying problems that exist in the insurance market.  The Governor created the “Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee” to address these important issues.  This Executive Order is online at: www.flgov.com/executive_orders.

 

Thank you again for writing.  Governor Bush wants to know how Floridians feel about the many critical issues we face and encourages you to share your views with your local legislative delegation.

I sent an email on 07/27/06  asking about the monies that myself and all the other millions of insured citizens of the State Of Florida have paid in over the past 20-30 years and never recieved an answer, explanation,or response.  Is this a hard one to answer or whats up or do you just simply not have an answer?  Thank you Debra Kay Phillips

Jeb,

We truly appreciate your detailed response to our last e-mail.

 

Since I first e-mailed you the situation has gotten much worse. The average homeowner who has been canceled and cannot get reasonable property Insurance, and cannot go without Insurance without being foreclosed upon by their Mortgage Company.

 

The millions of Floridians whose jobs are affected by the Housing markets are quickly losing their business and many will soon be Bankrupt.  This affects every person employed in the Construction, Real Estate, Mortgage, Title, Inspections, etc.

 

The time to call special sessions is now before it is too late. Even if we cannot find all of the solutions we can mitigate, offset, or delay some of the pain until Long term solutions can be found. This is not a new problem and we have had almost a year to research the problem and weigh the solutions.

I am very concerned about the house my wife and I have owned for about 20 years in Saint Petersburg Fl. This October my current insurance company Nationwide has told me that I will be canceled because they are not going to renew my policy. We have been with them for auto and homeowners for over 20 years between 2 houses. Now of course I will probably have to go with Citizens and of course pay a lot more. I see very possibly that we will be forced to sell and hopefully not loose our home and not even be able to live in the area that we love because it costs to much to live here. My wife works a full time job, has raised our two sons, and I have worked a full time job along with at least one part time job for over 20 years straight. If insurance companies wont insure us here then they should not be allowed to sell auto insurance here either. Maybe that will help the competition. This is  a huge issue with me along with gas prices, and affordable alternatives. Please do something to help. Sincerely Kelly Fenclau

Governor Bush - Something HAS be done about insurance and tax rates.  We moved to Florida to enjoy a well-earned retirement.  We have our primary residence and bought two rental properties and thought we were set to live out our days in Florida.
 
Insurance rates and property taxes are so prohibitive that we can no longer afford to stay here.  If we can get someone dumb enough to buy our properties we are moving from Florida to the mid-west.
 
I guess that this one way of keeping people here in Florida. Make the taxes and insurance so high that no one will buy their buy their property and they are, like us, TRAPPED IN FLORIDA.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
   I am writing to you to ask for your help in acquiring an Insurance policy that I can afford.  Citizens turned me over to Security First Ins. and my premium more than doubled from $2600 annually to $5361 annually.  I am retired with an income of $806 monthly from Social Security and my daughter and her children live with me and between the two of us we pay a $1538.21 a month mortgage along with all the usual bills.  We barely get by as it is and it is impossible for us to pay all that money for Homeowners Ins, but we have to have it.  Even with payments of $465 a month with the mortgage, utilities, food, gas, dental and medical costs, misc. living expenses, etc.,  it is virtually impossible to pay for such a high premium.
I know that there are many citizens of Fl and especially Palm Bch County with this problem.
Could you please offer an affordable solution!!??  You have the power to help the people of Florida; the taxpayers and voters who elected you to your position as our Governor, the same people who will remember you during the up coming elections as you seek to move higher in the governmental system.  You could be seen as someone who really cares about the people, especially at this crucial time when they need your assistance.

Jeb:
My Insurance will double next May.  Apparently I am luckier than many who will have their policies cancelled.  However I don't feel lucky.  I understand the impact of Hurricanes etc., on these rates but I have a couple of disturbing observations.  
1). Insurance Agents appear to make too much money!  Two agents I know make over $400,000 per year - and I only know two.  I don't know if there is a State/National average, but if this is typical then it is outrageous to say the least.
2). Insurance Money, (perhaps in rural areas only), appears to be dispensed carelessly.  Someone I know with a rented field (for their cows) received fence damage in Hurricane Charley. They received several thousand dollars from their agent, fixed the fence themselves, and spent the insurance money on a new tin roof, and Hurricane proof windows - when their home received little or no damage. Formerly they were firm believers in the adage "There is no such thing as a free lunch" but I don't hear that out of their lips anymore. 
 
Seems like the rest of us are paying for these types of things, and quite frankly I am more than angry.  I don't make frivolous claims, shoot I don't even make claims, and yet my premiums are going through the roof.
 
Florida is getting to be too expensive. We are taxed out the gazoo, prices for gas, electricity, homes, etc have risen incredibly, and wage increases don't keep up.  I am a staunch Republican and have always voted along party lines since eligible, because I share the party values. I have voted for common good over possible personal gain.   I detest people like Kerry, Kennedy, and Clinton but during the next elections I will look seriously at the Democratic candidates.  If I get the perception that a candidate is for me I will vote that way this time.  I suspect this is true of many Republicans.   I will vote the Republican candidate out - simply because things are usually better for me personally under Democratic government.  I hope that is of great concern to you and the party.

Subject:	Insurance cancelled with less than 30 days notice at the approaching height of hurricane season!!!!

Dear Jeb,
 
We have lived, since the fall of 1977, in Gulf Breeze, Florida (near the Crawford Rainwater family, who have always been strong supporters of you family, as have we) on a canal that does not directly front the Intracoastal Waterway. Major hurricanes Frederick/Erin/Opal impacted us but with minimal and mostly cosmetic damage - one roof replacement. Then Ivan and 16" of water in the house in an area never thought to have that happen. At least we were the lucky ones, compared to those who were on the front lines of the waterways.
 Our insurance was with Safeco through our local agent, Underwood and Anderson. Safeco dropped out from writing Florida homeowner policies after IVAN. Underwood Anderson found First Protective, who would accept us - but only after a 4-point inspection was completed. This was done. First Protective sent all necessary paperwork and documentation of honoring a policy at 964 Aquamarine Dr., Gulf Breeze, FL. Of course the rate changed from $1400 to $3500, but at least we had protection. We have always maintained flood insurance. On Aug.4, I received a letter from First Protective, stating we would no longer be covered as of 8-27-06. First of all, I though one had to have a minimum of a 30 day notice. I'm very concerned of a period, during the height of hurricane season, to have a company drop you after meeting all compliance issues and receiving notification of acceptance. The reason: First Protective does not underwrite homes with aluminum wiring. There was a brief period of time in the early 70's that homes were built with aluminum wiring. As long as one does all normal and customary maintenance, annual check and be sure all connections are tight - never cause stretch to wires - such as in an attic where items might be stored, there should be no problems.  There are over a hundred homes in this community, many built during that era. To my knowledge there has been only one fire in all of 30 years to any of these homes, and I can't confirm that was due to aluminum wiring.
 
Underwood Anderson rechecked and found no other company under its group to provide underwriting to us, except for Citizen's at a $6760 price.  1. How can an insurance company drop you during the height of a storm season (already mentioned this)? 2. Most companies will not cover you for a minimum time out, esp. if a named storm is already in progress. I received less than a 30 day notice. I'm not sure I'll be able to find coverage available by 8-28-06.
 
Can this happen? Can they do that to us? Is it legal? I'm scared, if a storm occurs near the end of Aug. or start of Sept. that impacts our home, I may not be protected. I can't come up with over $6000+  in less than 30 days, even if I elected to go with Citizen's. I don't because I've read nothing but bad press in our newspapers regarding its ability to provide comparable relief, after a catastropic event.
 
What am I to do? I still do not think a company should have the right to drop you, after agreeing to accept you, esp. at this point in the hurricane season. 
 
I'm told, they can accept you, but never initially asked to see the 4-point inspection results - only to have proof it was done. Then, sometime in July, they asked to review the inspection results (after I was accepted and had paid my premium). It was noted of the aluminum wiring and that is not within their standards of issuing insurance policies and we received the notice of cancellation.
 
Please help me with answers. Time is too short.

Dear Governor Bush,
  Insurance for home owners is outrageous.  I'm a native Floridian, born and raised in Ft. Lauderdale, moved to Seminole about 26 years ago.  Where I met my husband and we married almost 24 years ago.  Due to an unfortunate accident, we were able to make a good thing happen.  We were able to have part of the "AMERICAN DREAM".  We bought our own home.  That was a great day in our lives.  We work hard to keep our house a home and in good repair, not some junky old place.  We both have been employed by the same employer for 21 years (That's unheard of these days).  The pay is above minimum rage but not by a whole lot.  But we pay our taxes, including school taxes which we have not and probably will not use the school system in Pinellas county.  Yeah, I know your thinking where is this headed.  That is if you actually read these emails.
  After Hurricane Andrew, Allstate dropped us and our home owners insurance was put into the joint underwriters pool.  We were finally picked up by Tower Hill insurance. But now this year in September they will not be renewing our policy.  Now I shall mention we have never had a claim against our home owners insurance and this is happening to us.
  After calling several agencies and the first question they ask is "What year was your house build in?"  They say NO we can't insure your house.  Because our house was built in 1961 no one will insure us except for Citizens.  This is crazy!  I have not got the quote as of this day but from what I read in the papers and hear on the news this policy will be out of this world.  Will we have to lose our part of the "AMERICAN DREAM"?  Because there is an insurance crisis in this state.
  It seems to me that the normal working class citizens is being punished because we can't afford a newer house.  With the cost of everything going up 20, 30, 40, even 50% and wages on average only go up 3-4% per year.  Then you top it off with 100-200% increases on insurance, how are the working class to make ends meet?
   The saying "The Rich get richer and poor get poorer",  comes to mind when you look at these increases.
   I hope and pray that something can be done in our state, so myself and others like me do not either have to give up their piece of the "AMERICAN DREAM" or even go with out insurance, and then what do you do when and if something happens to your home, the same exact thing you lose your piece of the "AMERICAN DREAM".
  Hoping this will not fall on deaf ears.
 
Sincerely,
 
Concerned Native Floridian,

Gov. Bush,

Thank you for creating a task force on affordable
homeowners insurance

One way to reduce homeowners insurance premiums and
also lower the risk to insurance companies is for
homeowners be allowed to insure their homes no less
than the current mortgage loan amount and a higher
deductible than $2,500

For example, the market value of our home is over
$200K, but our current mortgage loan amount is $87K,
however, the "insurance companies" will not allow us
to insure it less than the replacement cost to rebuild
it. This results in higher premiums for us and more
risk exposure for the insurance company

A higher deductible than $2,500 would offer lower
premiums for us who live in safe areas and don't file
minor claims and/or never will file a claim unless
home sustain serious major damages

In the event our home was totally destroyed we would
downsize to a smaller house and/or move out of Florida

Lt. Governor Jennings,
 
Hello!
 
An article was just sent to me regarding grants that may become available to homeowners to improve upon homes that were built under less strict standards than those built within the last decade, through the Community Development Block Grant Program.  This sounds great!  My home is frame and was built in 1942.  I am in Lake Worth, FL and am unable to afford to upgrade everything that would need to be in order to withstand a strong storm.  I agree with your proposal to HUD.
 
I'm wondering how I may stay on top of the status of this program, or if you have any additional information about it.  Please let me know!  I'm also a Realtor and would like to have as much information available for my customers as possible regarding this matter.

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings

            On a recent TV news broadcast I saw that you were leading a team to study Florida’s insurance crisis, (and don’t use ‘crisis’ casually) and I would like to convey my concerns along with what I expect are hundreds of thousands of other Florida homeowners. Your committee simply has to solve this issue for the Florida homeowners. 

 

            Like many of today’s policy holders I recently received my notice of ‘non renewal’ from my current carrier and when I tried to find replacement coverage I was told that ‘Citizens was my only choice’ and to make matters worse I have no control over the amount of insurance that I can get. I was told that my premium of $700 would now jump to $2,600 but I was getting ‘full replacement’ value’, Lt. Governor Jennings I don’t want or need full replacement coverage but I am told that is all that is offered. I own a small 1,200 square foot concrete block home built in 1970 and in some respects is more sturdy than some of today’s new homes, even with the Dade County codes applied. We are in central St. Petersburg, in a non flood zone and no history of claims of any sort but none the less we are forced into Citizens.

 

            There has to be a solution to this crisis, shared windstorm risk between private insurers and the State (Citizens?), home owners coverage provided via the industry and windstorm provided by Citizens or some other ‘affordable’ shared risk. My wife and I are both on Social Security and being ‘forced’ to pay premiums in excess of $200 per month means that something else will have be cut back. Is it food, medicine, sell my car, what do I have to do to live here, as a life long Florida resident the possibility of having to move to another state is traumatic to say the least, but we have to be able to live and Florida is quickly becoming my last choice.

 

            I implore you find some way to solve this crisis but above all PLEASE don’t let the lobbyist’s influence what you know to be the right decision for us the homeowners. I am aware that the insurance industry wields enormous clot but so do we as voters. We have the power to vote anyone one out of office that does not support the needs of the citizens. 

 

            I think that Governor Bush and his team have lead the State in the right direction but lets not ruin it all now with a failure to accomplish this task.

 

Sincerely

Dear Ms Jennings:

       Floridians are fortunate that you are heading the committee to 
propose solutions to the insurance crisis.
       For years my home insurance has been through Vanguard Insurance of 
Winter Park, Florida.
This year, since my bill for my insurance is long overdue, I called to 
discover why it has not been
mailed in its usual timely manner.  My agent reluctantly informed me that my 
rate has more than doubled, even though I have had no claims and live over 
six miles from water.  I can only speculate that Vanguard is waiting 
expectantly so see if they can join the ripoff of the public already 
proposed by major companies.  I'm sure you will hear thousands of stories 
like mine in the weeks to come.
But it comes down to this:  the insurance industry is neck-and-neck with the 
oil industry in wealth.
When they are called on to actually pay the consumers who have paid 
generously over the years,
they try every devious scheme possible to avoid payment.  The entire Gulf 
coast has suffered with
their deception after Katrina.  As you know, they still have not paid for 
Charley.  But now, taking a
page from the oil companies book on public extortion, they are robbing 
homeowners through unjustified rate increases.  It's time for Florida to 
straighten them out.  A close investigation will probably reveal that many 
insurance executives need to join the top Enron cronies in a public 
facility.
     Best wishes for your new responsiblity.  I hope you can help us. Scott Ridener@msn.com

Governor Bush,

We just received our insurance renewal bill today. I guess I should feel lucky since they didn’t drop us, however, that’s not the case. Rather, I almost had a heart attack. I knew the policy amount would be going up but it more than doubled. Our policy last year was $2312.24. Our new policy will be $4995.62. That is totally outrageous. And we pay flood insurance on top of that. We live in a 1320 sf house. It’s not some mansion. We moved into this house in June 2002. Our insurance at that time was $784.00 and look at it now. We are considering moving out of Florida. At the very least, we might consider moving to an apartment (although that might not work either since all the apartments around here are going condo). We can’t afford to live here anymore. So much for the American dream……not in Florida anyway.

Dear Governor Bush,

Once again the State of FL has us in a slow burn mode via your Lt.
Governor, Toni Jennings who chairs the Insurance Reform Committee.

In May right before Hurricane Season the last of our permanent shutters were installed on our 2005  State code built Hurricane-resistant house.

We are well over 55, homestead exemptioned, way (far, far, far, far) under the $500K value limit on a single family retirement home and probably qualify for "low income" too.  Under $20k pension.

So starting in two weeks the state is going to inspect houses to give those folks who sat on their hands for a couple years 1/2 (or all) of their money back on the same improvements we decided was prudent to protect one's property and lives. As recommended by the STATE.

We pay high insurance with State Farm + donate to Citizens yearly + bought a home up to current wind standards out of the evacuation and sinkhole zones. NOW it is decided that the people with houses sitting on the water (evacuation zone) will get all the tax money we pay to do the same thing we just did in May - PROTECT OURSELVES.

The least the State can do is allow work performed in 2006 to be grandfathered into the mix. Since the County building dept. all ready inspected our installation as to code it would be a simple matter for the State inspector to agree it is required. It took 4 months to get these shutters in the "off season". That means no one will get these things installed until 2007 anyhow.

How can we PROTECT OURSELVES from the slow to react government and BENEFIT from their belated generousity with our own money? Good thing this is an election year as the "easy button" will be put to good use.

You and Toni Jennings are asking for ideas regarding

We need MORE COMPETITION DOWN HERE, but one
good thing to have is a HIGH DEDUCTIBLE.  I have
the highest I could get on my homeowner's ins. and
that is $2500.  I asked for $5000 or more and the
insurance co's will not give it to us.

as to the real estate tax burden, I've offered advise but
I never hear from any one you....all anybody wants is
the damn vote.  Put a grandfathered clause on people
who have homestead in Fl and if they move from one
county to another within the state, do not double or
triple their taxes, but grandfather them to take over the
new house's r.e.taxes.  The real estate market is the
poorest I've EVER seen while in the business.
Insurance co's MUST help the homeowner as to 
deductibles because many of us will not be able to
afford the high premiums that are coming in.
Citizens Property is a laughable solution and Tom
Gallagher doesn't know what he's doing.  All he wants
is the prestige of a SEAT.
When a new property owner comes in Fla for the
first time, then you can increase the r.e. tax accordingly.
When a renter buys for the first time, then accordingly
charge him a correct real estate tax. It's the FIRST TIME
homeowner that could see a higher tax burden.
Ask Charlie who I am.  I'm not a novice in this business
of real estate, I do know what I'm talking about.
Something must be done to homeowner's insurance
and the real estate taxes.  I blasted you and the senators
who are taking one million dollars of taxpayers money
for one year just to study what to do....how insane!!!!!
 
It's very strange when a politician is running for office
you want his/her vote, but when we need some action
on something or other and we write you, strange, but
we don't hear from you!!!
I'm trying to earn a living and it's so hard that I just
cannot bring in any money.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to you to file a complaint against the insurance industry’s increases and to request your assistance to 
obtain affordable home insurance.

I see that you called a Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee Meeting yesterday in Tallahassee.  Would 
you kindly send my letter to members of your committee who will write coverage at a reasonable rate for my home?

History
Last year, the premium for my home was $846 with First Protective through Allstate, Peter Gillis, Tarpon Springs, Florida.  This year, First Protective claims Gillis did not renew his contract with their company which Gillis denies.  However, the same Allstate will insure my home through Citizens at an increase of  nearly 500% - from $846 to nearly $3900.  I am presently in the hospital and don’t know what to do about what the insurance companies are doing.   

Insurance companies claim they are not writing homes which are more than twenty years - some have a six year limit  This is absurd. It will leave the majority of Florida homes uninsured.  The tax appraiser lists my home as having been built in 1910 which faced the terrible hurricanes of the 20’s and 30’s without damage or being flooded.  Old timers say the house was a Ladies Home Journal  “Home of the Year.”  Even if it were not, it certainly has superior construction to those recently built.  
I have never had a claim.

Before coming to the hospital, even though I was not feeling well, I searched diligently to find coverage because I was told 
that some independent companies were still writing at reasonable rates.  However, the many companies that we called claim the only company still writing was Citizens and only at astronomical rates.  My Mother, Maria Mosley, also searched and 
even contacted FMAP who passed our request on to Pro-Trust which states in their email that no one is writing in our area.  Anna Brydes’ (Pro-Trust) email was received only after being sent on a wild goose chase to spend many hours trying to find mythical companies who are still writing.  Brydes’ email is enclosed in  the hard copy to follow.

My policy expires on August 15, 2006.  I would greatly appreciate if you would take an interest in my problem.  I can be reached by you or your representative at (727) 942-1793.

The astronomical increases by the insurance companies is not only effecting me, but many thousands of retired 
citizens living in Florida on a fixed income.  They need and deserve defending from those who are unethical in the insurance industry.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Debora Mosley

You must call a special session and resolve this issue with home owners insurance.

 

I have been forced to cancel my mother’s homeowners due to rate increase beyond her fixed income.  The dollar value of replacement is higher than the premium and we will just have to take a chance with liability.  Her homeowner’s association dues and assessments are making my fixed income difficult to help.

 

Let alone my homeowners insurance privately and through my association. Maintenance fees and dues are going up but pay is not.  Raising the percentage on deductible does not make a difference. If I don’t have the funds to rebuild; what difference does two percent make? My association dues are going up because our insurance on common areas are going up.  

 

Citizen’s is not enough. We need competition to bring rates down.  JUA; it was to help after Hurricane Andrew’s insurance companies lacked on having reserves. Now Citizens was suppose to be the last resort; now IT”S THE ONLY RESORT!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

If rates do not come in alignment me and co-workers will be forced to leave the state.  My salary is fixed, small percentage of raise once a year; and without a formal education I will be forced to leave to reduce costs.  Bringing in high paying jobs is great for the media (Scripps); but us little people who really are the back bone of the economy are being forced to hoard medication, skimp on diet and now go without protection.

Dear Jeb Bush.
 
I am writing you to encourage you to work hard in insurance reform in south Florida. I am a small business owner that has been in the Engineering Service for 11 years as a S Corporation.
 
Recently I sent my Insurance Company my years policy renewal. After 2 months and right in the middle of July I was sent back a check and canceled by Northpointe due to them leaving the state.
 
I have been trying for weeks to get a coverage for business liability, windstorm and professional liability. As of today I am unsuccessful in getting coverage, and the quotes for liability and property without windstorm is 500% costlier then I paid in May 2006. This issue Will put me out of business as a lease requires me to have windstorm coverage.
 
Please do something to stop the insurance companies from picking / choosing / canceling etc at their will. The comments I am hearing are ridiculous
 
1 - Building more then 5 years old
2 - Building east of US 1
 
 
These two comments are not close to truth. Age means nothing and the notion that east of US 1 means anything different then being west of US1 anywhere South of I-10 makes no sense. All people in southern Florida have the same risk wherever their business or homes are.
 
I appreciate the work mentioned on insurance reform but it needs to be quick, and penalize the insurance companies that pick and choose their customers. Either make the rates the same for all, or get out all together
 
Best regards

Dear Governor Bush,
 

We are the owners of a condo in the 71-unit Lake Villas Condominiums in Altamonte Springs.  We have recently had our insurance canceled, but we assure you, it was not for any claim we have ever filed.  We were literally forced to take insurance with Citizens at an additional pay-it-all-now fee of five times higher than last year, resulting in an immediate emergency assessment of $3300 per unit.  In the event one of the buildings within the property sustain $30,000 of roof damage, Citizens will claim no responsibility for that damage leaving us basically uninsured.    Additionally, we have purchased some basic coverage at a cost of $7400.  Also, the lack of Ordinance and Law coverage leaves all Lake Villas owners open to the possibility of loss amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.  

 

Our association has existed for 33 years and over that time we have filed very minimal claims.  Now as condominium owners, we are being singled out to pay for the losses of the whole state, especially those losses along the coast.  Our insurance costs are $261 for the for internal coverage and a whopping $3300 for the property (per unit).  This cost is HUGE!!

 

We feel as though you, as part of the legislature, have abandoned us and the other owners of Lake Villas as well as the thousands of condo owners across the state.  Also, you have blind-sided us all, leaving us in the position of not being represented on this issue and leaving us without ‘reasonable’ insurance to protect us from natural disasters.  

 

You, as an official of the state, have been elected to lead us and protect us, your constituency, and to take whatever action is necessary in that endeavor.  From our point of view, on this issue and this issue alone, you have not represented us and you have not protected us.  Unfortunately, our vote will have to follow our purse and as of last week, we are $3300 poorer.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As a business owner in south Florida I am facing an insurance crisis.  I know that you are hearing this from many in the same situation throughout the state.  As the owner of 4 preschools in Palm Beach County, I would like to tell you what I am facing.  One of my schools in Jupiter is un insured and protected by a guard on "fire watch" because I have been unable to secure property insurance including wind coverage.  My insurance agent and several others I have contacted have been searching for coverage and what we have found that they are not easily found, if you do find a company that will consider your application the cost and deductibles are unaffortdable and offer no protection.  One company that we are negotiating with may be willing to cover one school location for an annual premium of $112,000.00 (that's ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS).  What as I insuring?  I would be paying a premium of $112,000.00 and have a deductible of $200,000.00 (Two Hundred Thousand Dollars).  In other words, if there were a claim I would be responsible for the first $200,000.00 in damages, so, damage of $199,999.00 would cost me $311,999.00 out of pocket!
 
As a little background, we are 4 private preschools schools in Palm Beach County and some of our location have been in operation over 20 years.  We are proud to provide this service in our community and of the programs we offer.  The preschool programs at our schools combined educational activities and instruction along with the nurturing, caring environment that children need and deserve.  Some of our locations participate in the state sponsored VPK program and include completely scholarship children who attend our school at no cost to their families.
 
I hear on the news that everyone is concerned, business owners are wondering how they can stay in business and how to pay these outrageous insurance costs.  How can we afford to pay these costs and remain in business?  Legislators and candidates voice concerns.  We need your concern, but we need action too.  If this is not brought under control for the private and business sector it will create massive problems for all the residents in the State of Florida.  How can typical Floridians survive a 100% plus increase in the cost of insurance on their own homes coupled with a minimum of 12% increase in every good, service, product that they need for their family.  All to cover the cost of insurance for ONE YEAR.
 
As taxpayers and Floridians we need help.  Call a special session of the State Legislature and work to find a way to help businesses and residents survive this crisis.  And have no doubt, it is a crisis; inaction will devastate Florida.  I am sure your economic advisors can tell you the incredible impact this will have on the economy of the state in every venue from banking to groceries to gas, health care to tourism.
 
I would appreciate your response to this e-mail address.

I have a house payment, utilities, and other expenses for my growing daughters that still go to school.  However, this year I do not know what I am going to do because my HOME INSURANCE rate went up to $5999.51 (including taxes) a year.  That is almost half of My yearly salary. I used to pay only $1,600.00 for my home Insurance.  I am afraid to loose my home because  my house payment is going to be too high.  I am sure there are more parents who have only one income that  want to keep a decent home for their children.  Please Help  us with the insurance rates. We want to live in decent homes for our children because they are the future.

The agency that funds this did not put it in their budget.  Without this funding the Family Cafe will not be able to hold this conference in 2007.  I know how much this conference means to you.  You have been a great friend and advocate for people with disabilities.  Is there a way that the APD can find the money we need for this year, then have the state reimburse them next year.  This is something we need taken care of soon. I would hate to tell all the people who look forward to coming to this conference that we will be canceled.  We are hoping that our next Governor will do as good a job as you have done for disabilities.   Please can you help us get the needed funding.  Thank you for all your support for us in the disability field.

Subject:	OUT OF CONTROL IN LEE COUNTY

Importance:	High

A MATTER OF CIVIL LIBERTY TO ENJOY MY RIGHTS AS A PROPERTY OWNER.
I have sent this to you because you are our highest elected representative 
in the State of Florida. This message has also been sent to other elected 
members representing me in US Federal offices, Florida State and County 
offices, and to members of the Florida State Select Committee To Protect 
Property Owner's Rights.
I feel this deserves immediate attention. Please read and advise me of your 
evaluation of this matter and how you may be able to assist my wife and me.
Legislation needs to be in place to protect ALL PROPERTY OWNERS. Not just 
homestead properties. We are just as much citizens of the USA and the State 
of Florida as anyone else and do not deserve to be taxed out of our life 
savings. My wife and I are both retired and on fixed income. Our property is 
our future!!! We planned our retirement for Florida and began implementing 
it over 5 years ago. However, since we became committed to Florida by 
placing all our retirement savings here, during the last two years we are 
systematically being destroyed by the out of control tax scheme going on 
there. I feel like our life savings are being taken away from us by the use 
of outrageously out of control tax schemes in Florida.
Our property should not be allowed to be assessed for taxation out of 
control while we own and hold it for our own use. Assessment should be base 
upon OUR REAL interests in our property. Not based upon a potential imagined 
"on-the-book value" as determined by the Government. We are being placed 
under duress to sell our properties in order to afford to pay taxes. 
Doubling and tripling taxes annually for us is not an option and seems like 
undue process to take away our property. I'm sure there are millions of 
Americans that agree.
HELP STOP THE ABUSE AND TAKING OF OUR PROPERTY THROUGH COERCION.

RECORD HIGH PROPERTY TAXES IN 2006
The Lee County online data records system located at http://www.leepa.org/ 
has revealed what I feel is a conspiracy to take our property. When the TRIM 
notices come this year Lee County real property owners are going to become 
aware that their real properties have magically increased in value. Some by 
more than 180 percent in the last year alone. This of course means that 
owners without a homeowner's exemption in place are going to be paying many 
times more in real property taxes for 2006.
Lee county seems to be taking the lead in trying to set a selling price for 
our property? Can it be that the County is now officially a real estate 
advisor with a crystal ball. Failing to heed the fact that sales have 
significantly slowed and many sellers have had to reduce their asking price 
during 2006, Lee County has sharply raised the 2006 taxable assessment on 
properties. We own a condo at River Park Place in Cape Coral. When I 
researched our condo I saw that our assessed value is increasing 58% for 
2006 over 2005. This is nearly going to double the taxes we pay. Some of the 
units have increase as high as 69% of the last years value. Property owners 
are unable to sell for these prices since the real estate market has really 
taken a down turn. But if the Lee County assessment goes through, our 
property taxes for these units will go up thousands of dollars. We just had 
increases amounting to nearly 25% in HOA dues because of higher insurance 
rates, etc. in the last two years.
Lee County has a new feature on the web site called the history chart. By 
clicking on this tool you can observe that since 2004 Lee County has mounted 
an aggressive strategy to tax property owners out of their property. The 
tool plots the assessed values yearly up to 2005. Even though the slope of 
the tax assessment by year is nearly vertical, the worse is not even shown. 
2006 taxes will dwarf all the previous years. For many owners it may mean 
the end of their ownership and start a real sell off of properties. For us 
we are really hurting since we won't be able to start our SOH exemption 
until next year when we become full time residents.
My wife's parents bought land in nearby Lehigh Acres nearly 40 years ago for 
their future retirement. Her Mother  and Father passed their interest  on to 
her 4 years ago. Since 2003 the assessed value of these vacant, unimproved 
properties, without water or sewer has shot from $1,200 in 2003, $4,000 in 
2004, to $16,300 in 2005. But the worse is not over. In 2006 the same 
unimproved lots are being assessed at $41, 560. That is a whopping 3,363 
percent increase in assessed value in less than 4 years. Taxes have shot 
from $40 per year to nearly $800. We were considering building here but 
could not afford the assessments and now the increased taxes. We don't know 
what we will be forced to do with our properties.
The story line in the News-Press on August 6, 2006 discussed utility 
expansion assessments on Cape Coral lot owners and is yet another issue 
adding to the woes of property owners. The article talked about the falling 
real estate market following the 2005 "red-hot market" where homeowners are 
having to reduce prices to sell their homes. This article also discussed 
utility assessments ranging from $21,902 to $32,853. How can Lee County be 
raising all of our assessed land values so high in the face of a real estate 
market that is definitely going the other way?
We need to stop the Lee County crystal ball reading real estate sales price 
setting and oppose this tax increase NOW. SOH (Save Our Homes) was the cry 
when Florida property owners needed to protect their homes against these 
type of unconscionable tax increases. It just seems that tax increases of 58 
to 170% in a single year warrant some voter involvement and need to be 
stopped.
Now we need to Save Our Property (SOP) from this attempt to force us out of 
our rights of ownership. Our State Legislation needs to look at fair 
taxation and rights of ownership with the intent of "for the People" and not 
allow such exorbitant tax increases without the vote of the People.

Subject:	Insurance Crisis......

Dear Governor Bush,

Thanks for reading my email. I am one of those Floridians who is suffering because of the insurance crisis in our state. Our small condo association cannot get 

insurance except thru Citizen's. Our units were built before 1994 and are in a no flood zone, in Pinellas county,,,,, but the cost has gone up over 300%.

After much thought, maybe there is a way out of this mess..... and it is a mess ! 

Why not put a cap on the amount of damage an insurance company would have to pay in the event of a claim. Use a figure of say $200,000.00. Above that amount 

Citizens Insurance would take over. Citizen's would not be effected by the lower claims : only amounts over $200,000.00. As a result, the cost for insurance from 

private companies could be less and the Citizens rates could be lowered because there would be no competition for the first $200,000.00 portion of the claim. Until 

this can be worked out, the Citizen's premiums should be lowered because of NO competition. ( It is my understanding that Citizen's rate is about 30% higher than 

rates charged by private companies so as to not compete with these companies.)

Another way would be to increase the amount of the deductible in the insurance policies for those homeowners who choose to build or buy at the beach. 

If you buy a $750,000.00 condo on the beach your deductible would be much higher than a $750,000.00 condo located away from the water and not in a flood plain. 

Those of us who do not live on the water should not have to pay these current high premiums because of those who choose to live where there is a potential of high 

claims due to wind and water events. The deductible could offset the difference.

Your task force to look into solutions to this mess is NOT the answer. A lot of these folks are tied to the insurance industry as are the candidates for your job. Many of 

us feel that we do not have a voice in Tallahassee and that no one listens to us,,,,,,, "After all, who are we to question those in office"?


I am sure many will contact you about this crisis. I know you have been a wonderful governor for this state,but DO YOUR DUTY NOW: Call a special 

session and get this mess cleaned up ! Florida depends on it...........

Thank you for all of your efforts.

Dear Governor Bush, 

One year ago I purchased a home in New Port Richey Florida. I live in New York now

but I could not afford a home here. I consider Florida my second home as I went to

 school there and have lived and worked there throughout my life. My plan is to move

 there as soon as I can. Unfortunately, No-one disclosed the Insurance situation to me

prior to the closing on my home. I paid $245,000 for the house. I am paying almost $4000 a year.

The home in New York where I have lived most of my life is worth approx. $600,000. (belongs to my parents)

Gov. Bush,

 

I am very concerned about the insurance crisis in the State of Florida. 

 

Please listen to one example of a crisis just within a mile radius of my home in Loxahatchee, Florida. I was invited to a gathering at my son’s house last weekend and found myself with 8 others talking about the insurance crisis. We found that 5 of us (unknowingly) had the same insurance company for the last 12 years or longer. Out of the 5 homeowners, 1 made a claim 18 years ago for theft, and 1 had a claim 7 years ago. The rest, none. To my surprise, 4 of the 5 had received a “letter” from this insurance company dropping them and their policy and no one knew why. All 4 couples were rushing to find another insurance company who would write them now during the hurricane season! None had succeeded. I have yet to receive this “letter” and I pray every night for them that had and for myself. My next door neighbor, who received this letter had found Citizens High Risk Group to write a policy over 4 times the amount of their previous insurer! NO ONE CAN AFFORD THIS! One of the other couples had State Farm and had received a letter raising their premium 53%.

WHAT DO WE DO?

 

We are in a weather pattern that lends itself to possible destruction at any time, and our homes have to be insured. However, we need to look at WHAT we are insuring and WHAT the insurance companies SHOULD be covering to replace! The policy coverages should be overhauled to cut the cost of replacement items such as screen enclosures, outbuildings, lean-to’s, sheds; pole barns, patio swings, swingsets, bbq grills, etc. My first suggestion is to STOP THIS THEFT FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES! These items are “add-ons” that homeowners should have a separate “rider” to replace. If the consumer wants to insure those items, they would pay extra for an insurance rider to cover them.  

 

My second suggestion is for insurance policies to cover our homes. This means the actual home structure. The residents of Florida are going to have to bite the bullet and become responsible for these items added to and around the home. 

 

The lending institutions enforce insurance policies to cover their investments. People cannot invest without those policies. I ask that you continue to give your utmost attention to the future of Florida while in office, as you have done in the past.

 

In closing, I applaud your efforts in addressing this crisis and I hope you and the task force will come to very drastic measures to insure that the people of Florida will continue to be able to work and thrive in our beautiful state.

 

I look forward to hearing from you,

Lisa Haas

Homeowner

I'm certain you already know this because you are a smart man. $5,000 to 50,000 homeowners ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING. It is pure politics, but again you already know that. That is exactly what it is intended to be. It is something for the media to disseminate to the clueless masses: JEB CALLS SPECIAL REFORM PANEL / INSURANCE IDEA HELPS OWNERS WHO FORTIFY. Decent looking headlines. Congratulations, it will probably work. By work I mean buy some time while you ride out of town. Who knows, you may even hit the daily double and have no storms hit this season. Perfect, you'll be long gone and on to bigger and better things and then when the whole thing does eventually unravel it's only a matter of fingerpointing with your successor. (By the way that successor will be Jim Davis who has nothing on this issue and should be an easy mark.)
 
As a two-time JEB voter it pains me this debacle has occurred on your watch. MAKE NO MISTAKE: THE STATE HAS FACILITATED THIS PROBLEM. The habitually poor 'ratings policy' over the past decade is the result of incompetence and/or corruption. It does not really matter. The crisis REALLY DOES EXIST AND NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED. This is not just another political football. It is changing Florida's landscape. Residents and businesses are leaving / the influx of transplants (legal) is slowing / the wave of foreclosures is just starting.
The list goes on, but again I'm certain you already know that because you are a smart man. I just wish you cared enough to quit being a politician and take the drastic actions necessary to fix the mess.

Subject:	Universal Property & Casualty Unethical Practice

Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Bush:

 

We had All State Insurance for a number of years.  We never filed a claim.   They dropped our policy.  We then secured insurance through Florida Preferred at double the price.  The state put them out of business.  In June of 2006, we secured insurance through Universal property & Casualty based in Fort Lauderdale at an even higher rate.  On August 8, we received a notice that they were canceling our policy.  They were paid the required 50% premium with the other 50% due in 60 days, and approved us.  The second half of the premium had already been mailed.  We had to stop payment on the check on the advice of our agent.  The policy was not even in force for 60 days.

 

According to my insurance agent, Universal Property and Casualty are just arbitrarily dropping policies.  They are not canceling all policies in the 34997 zip code, and they are not canceling all policies in my community, Mariner Sands Country Club.  They gave a reason, as the house is wood frame.  90% of the homes in Mariner Sands are wood frame and they were not cancelled.

 

Why do you allow these companies to arbitrarily cancel a homeowners policy that has never filed a claim, the home has went through three hurricanes without a scratch, and the homeowners have excellent credit and financial wherewithal?

 

How can these insurance companies contribute millions of dollars to yours, and others political campaigns, yet say they are unable to insure Florida’s homeowners?  

 

We, as well as many of our friends and neighbors, have had it with these out of control insurance companies, the high property taxes, and the extreme increase in the overall cost of living in Florida.  We, like many others are moving out of this state but we will still be here at election time.  We, or our family, friends and neighbors do not intend to support any Republican candidate for office even though we have been life-long Republicans.  

 

Florida is destined to be a state of the ultra-rich and the ultra-poor.  There is no room for hardworking, honest people in this state.

was $900.00 last year $1300.00 this year they want $3600.00. That is a 
crime. But, I found a bigger crime the SALES TAX. From $63.00 to $252.00 
Talk about gouging why does the state get more money because my insurance 
went up. The insurance company had a bad year. The state had money left 
over. I thaink I is Criminal form the state to charge sales tax on these 
inflated amounts. HOW ABOUT A ROLL BACK ON SALES TAX. AND A REBATE. At 
less it would help a little. This one thing you CAN do to help with

I had homeowners insurance with Poe. I knew, I was going to be cancelled, and put under Citizens insurance, in October of this year. I found insurance with Nation Wide in June. I cancelled my insurance with Poe/Citizens. I received my refund. The only thing, I am upset about, They kept a $100.00 of my refund, and now I have to pay them 2% at the end of the year as all homeowners do. I'm being double charged by the State ran insurance company. I think this is very shady. They are cheating people left and right. I'd like to now why they are getting away with this. Can your office check into this. It's not so much the money it's the principal of the whole thing. My home address 10330 Tarragon Drive. Riverview, Florida 33569. Thanking You in advance.

Subject:	[*] A possible solution suggestion to solving the insurance problem

Florida is going to be always subject to a higher risk of major weather conditions that effect property owners and renters as well. In order to provide a re-insurance market that could be operated by the state of Florida Insurance Commission, I have the following suggestions:
 
 
Pass legislation that will provide for a one percent increase in the Florida State Sales Tax that will go into a new super re-insurance fund in a State of Florida controlled Corporation. As this fund builds reserves, you can eliminate the Citizens Insurance fund that you are now subsidizing.
 
After all the State of Florida does not need to be in the insurance business of writing insurance directly to the consumer because of the extreme difficulty in establishing and maintaining the necessary experienced personnel with the knowledge to operate such a plan. That should be left up to the Property and Casualty Insurance Companies some of whom are reluctant to operate in the Florida or do so on a limiter selective basis. These Companies seek to outsource some of their insurance risk by outsourcing for re-insurers in the world market place. Thus that is where the ultimate problem of high premiums and high risks are involved. 
 
That is also where the State of Florida can be the most effective with the least amount of risk and administrated costs. It becomes it's own re-insurers with funds developed from not only it's residents, but also from visitors or guests who use our facilities which must be insured. Everyone pays for covering the obvious hazards of owning all types of insured property from real estate, motorized vehicles, and personal property.
 
The Florida resident will pay more in sales tax (we could exempt food and medicine if we have to) but receive a reduction in their insurance bills. I do not have at my disposal the exact dollars this idea of the one  percent sales tax would raise in any given year, but I am sure that if the tax was passed, that it would generate enough funds over a period of years to be a player in the re-insurance market and eventually able to stand alone in covering Florida's needs for cheaper insurance premiums through providing cheaper re-insurance for the existing Insurance Companies operating and licensed by Florida. Eventually, Florida could shut down the Citizens Insurance Fund or if necessary to keep it for competitive reasons for island or near shore properties being able to get reasonable insurance coverage.
 
Hope this may be passed on to the new special task force committee on insurance.

The Hon. Governor Jeb Bush

Dear Governor Bush:

It has come to my attention that a $310,000 subsidy for the Pensacola 
Greyhound Track has been included in the state budget. Please veto this 
subsidy.

As a voter, I do not want the state to subsidy this cruel industry.  I am 
appauled that my tax dollars could being going to support racetracks instead 
of education, the  healthcare situation, law enforcement, huricane victums, 
or a number of other worthy and necessary aspects of our society.

While at the racetrack, dogs are confined in small cages barely large enough 
for them to stand up or turn around for long hours each day. Also, many 
greyhounds suffer serious injuries while racing and many others are 
euthanized when they are no longer fast enough to be profitable.  Since 
when, is it the state's responsibility to financially support such 
practices?

Thank you in advance for your consideration of this important issue.

Subject:	Dining With Dogs

Dear Governor Bush,

There are some ideas that are so good, you know from the start that they will benefit society.  There are some ideas that are so bad, they never get past the thinking stage.  Then are the ideas that give you a red flag in your gut and/or your brain to tell you of a possible danger and, at the very least, need more thinking and discussion.

When I first heard of the possibility that Governor Bush signed into law allowing dogs, other than guide dogs, to be allowed into restaurants I was astounded, but not surprised.  This morning, Wednesday, August 9, 2006, I read a story in the Jacksonville, Fl. Times that the law is in effect and local business owners are figuring ways to capitalize on this law.

This situation has the possibility of being a really bad idea.  Why?  Because some time down the road something very bad will happen.  The dogs might get in a fight.   Someone, possibly an innocent child, will get bitten, perhaps mauled.  Then there are the overwhelmingly negative health aspects involved.

Earlier, I said that I was not surprised.  The reason for this is that when I first moved to Clay County, I was in a local retail establishment in Orange Park.  I saw a customer walking around with his dog following him.  This was obviously not a guide animal.  I asked an employee how it was that an animal was allowed to wander around.  What about Health Department restrictions and the risk to other customers and employees?  He said, in a matter of fact, casual attitude, that it was no big deal.  They, the county, had never had any laws concerning this.  I contacted the County Health Department and found out that indeed, there were no restrictions other than pets could not be in an establishment that sold food, unless they were a guide animal.

I was very astounded.  I have lived in various parts of the country and this was the first time I have come across a lack of restriction concerning pets.  This leads me to believe that, given the above scenarios, sometime in the future, there will be legal proceedings against a retail establishment and eventually the State.  These proceeding will be about liability and health concerns and the person filing the law suit will, as is usual, go for the big, deep pockets of the State.  That means the money of taxpayers.

Will it take a situation like this for someone to ask, “What were these people thinking when they passed this law?” to realize what a bad idea this is?  

Now is the time to re-think this law and repeal it.  If dog owners can’t be away from their pets for an hour or so, they have much larger issues with which to deal.  They can always invite their friends and their pets over for a backyard party.  If it was introduced and passed to gain a few votes from the pet/dog loving voter bloc, it is a monumentally bad idea.  Where is the common sense and concern for others?

Dear Mr. Gallagher:

 

 

I have lived in my home for thirty two years, have raised four children who are responsible adults (my daughter is a U.S. Marine) and have seven grandchildren. My husband and I feel it is now our time! Citizens insurance has changed that. They have dropped my coverage and turned it over to HomeWise insurance. I was paying $2595.00 a year to Citizens (which I thought was an exorbitant amount) and now HomeWise is charging me $4455.00 for less coverage.

 

This, coupled with taxes, flood insurance and general liability insurance has made our dreams of retirement a forgotten thing.

 

Can anything be done?

 It is not like I am doing nothing to help myself, I work, because social security does not pay enough to live on, and  the job insurance helps with medicare costs.

Just to let you know, we are losing our house.  I am trying to sell but it just doesn't look very good.  We have been in this home for 30 years, and now we can no longer afford it.  
 
Our insurance is out of hand and so are the taxes.  We are on a fixed income and have no way of paying our mortgage anymore.  
 
This may not high on your priorities, but to us it is the worst possible accurance that has ever happened.  We are leaving the state and are in hopes to be able to to sell so that we do not go into forclosure.  But, the previous looks inevitable.  What a horrible thing to have happened to good people.

  I hope you will read this e-mail.Not some staffer. I would like to express my opinion on the lack of respect that you give to the citizens of Florida.You have been elected by the people of Florida, and you have thrown them to the wolfs ( INSURANCE COMPANY'S ).The state of Florida had over 3 million left over at the end of the year.And you gave citizen's insurance a portion and the middle class got the shaft. Now, I have paid 150.00 for noithing.That 150.00 could have paid for my daughter's brace for a month. 
 Why do you allow the insurance company's, to run the state of Florida. I thought that was why you were elected.Well you do not have much longer in offices. So I guess you are going to turn your back on the middle class and let them bale you out again.Only this time the middle class can not afford this government mess...circus or joke whatever you want to call it.Oh, would you replace McCarthy the insurance company's yes men.When the insurance company want's a increase 100% or 150% McCarthy wimp's out and gives in to them.You are about to run people out of Florida and no business will want to come to Florida .I guess that this time next year there will be a recession thank's to the insurance company's running the Florida.

As discussed, you wanted us to provide you with an estimate on your renewal policy coming up on 9/12/06. We will plan to meet to discuss your program but I know you wanted an idea of how much it is going to be.   
 
On the policy excluding windstorm (written through Western Heritage), the total annual premium for the 9/12/05-9/12/06 term was $38,597.08. The renewal offer under the same terms is $41, 334.13. We will be able to finance the premium on this policy. 30% will be required down (by 9/12) and then the rest will be paid over a 10 month period.  
 
On your windstorm policy with Citizens Property Insurance Company (through the state), your annual premium for 3 of the buildings was $6249 for the 9/12/05-9/12/06 term. Your renewal premium for these same 3 buildings with Citizens is $29, 021. As you can see, Citizens Property Insurance Company has taken a major rate increase due to all of the storm activity the last couple of years. This premium will be due by 9/12/06 to the mailing address provided with your bill from Citizens. No payment plan is available through Citizens. 
 
Regarding your other windstorm policy through Indian Harbor Insurance Company, the total annual premium for this policy was $19,576.29. As you know, they are non-renewing your policy and we have not been able to secure any other windstorm market which means we will have to move these buildings to Citizens. The current quote for these buildings is $54,231. However, this quote is subject to change since your renewal date is not until 9/12. 
 
You will be losing the loss of rents coverage with Indian Harbor since Citizens does not offer any loss of rents coverage.   
 
This brings your total annual premium estimate to $124,586.13 for the term 9/12/06-9/12/07 and that is before making any changes. 
 
We are still checking other windstorm markets but we are not optimistic of any other markets. 
 
I'm sorry the rate has increased so much with no options. I wish we had another market to offer.   
 
After you have reviewed this, please give me a call to discuss.

TALLAHASSEE -- Florida's teetering property insurance industry got what it wanted this year from the state: new power to raise consumer prices.

The Legislature crafted the industry incentives as insurers poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into election campaigns of lawmakers, state political parties and candidates for statewide offices.

Insurers now can automatically raise prices for homeowner coverage 10 percent without any state review. And to make Florida even more enticing to property insurers, legislators tossed in $250 million in loans for insurers willing to expand in this state.

The changes have been hailed across the country by the insurance industry as a big help to do business in a hurricane-battered state.

Consumer activists say it was a giveaway to an industry that already gets its way in Tallahassee.

Analysts say the legislation was not a surprise, given the industry's consistent political donations.

``It's always hard to say that the money bought something specifically, but the money certainly buys the industry access to decision-makers,'' said Sue O'Connell, research director for the Institute on Money and State Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group based in Montana. ``It opens doors and allows them [insurers] access in a way that the typical citizen may not have. It also seems pretty clear from the way that industry distributes its donations that Florida is a pretty important state to the insurance companies.''

Since 1996, the property insurance industry has given $11.2 million to Florida candidates and state political parties, with roughly three of every four dollars to Republicans, according to research by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

The 2006 campaigns already have received at least $1.7 million from the property insurance industry, state records show.

O'Connell has examined property insurance industry campaign contributions across the country over three election cycles -- 2000, 2002, and 2004 -- and found Florida is vital to the property insurance market, judging by where the industry spends its campaign donations.

She said that in 2004, Florida ranked No. 10 among all states in total contributions from political donors. But in candidate contributions from the property insurance industry, she said, Florida politicians ranked second in the nation, behind only California that year.

Most donations to GOP

The insurance industry has given the bulk of its money to the party in power, the Sun-Sentinel has found. At least $4 million has been given in the last decade to the Republican Party of Florida, mainly from industry trade groups and associations but also from insurers, their lobbyists and executives.

By contrast, the Florida Democratic Party received slightly more than $1 million.

The contributions represent a small fraction of what's given each year to state parties and candidates in Florida. Other industries, such as telecommunications businesses, home builders and real estate agents, give more. Sun-Sentinel research found that about 2 percent of what's been given to all Florida campaigns and state parties since 1996 -- or $11.2 million of more than $557 million -- can be reported as having come from the property insurance industry.

Campaign finance analysts say the Florida insurance industry still packs a political wallop. That power was on display May 16 when Gov. Jeb Bush signed into law the 156-page property insurance bill that guarantees higher policyholder costs and bigger insurance industry profits.``This is the most significant, comprehensive property insurance legislation that has been enacted since Hurricane Andrew,'' said Len Brevik, the national executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents. He said it's ``precisely the kind of innovation'' that Congress should mimic.

Critics call it a politically timid and anti-consumer answer to what ails Florida's insurance market. The law has been criticized in recent weeks by Democratic candidates for governor and some Republicans, such as state Rep. Randy Johnson of Winter Garden, a candidate to be Florida's chief financial officer.

``The insurance crisis has crept on the kitchen tables of Floridians and they are mad about it and responding to it. ...,'' Johnson said of reaction to increased rates. ``It is about insurance company greed, plain and simple.''

While some candidates criticize the law as an industry sellout, Florida's top insurance regulators, such as state Chief Financial Officer Tom Gallagher, a Republican running for governor, say it was just the start of a solution. His 2006 gubernatorial campaign has received at least $379,000 in donations from the insurance industry. Only the Republican and Democratic state parties and Bush's gubernatorial campaigns have received more money from the state's insurers than Gallagher has taken in for his 2006 race for governor.

He also has received at least $369,000 in industry donations during previous campaigns for other state offices, including the one he holds.

Gallagher campaign aides say Gallagher is not beholden to the insurers.

``No one has been more forceful and cracked down on insurance companies more than Tom Gallagher,'' said Alberto Martinez, Gallagher's gubernatorial spokesman. ``He's called State Farm and Allstate out on the carpet whenever they've tried raising rates and not responding to their customer's needs. ... Tom has a record of fighting for consumers and a record of speaking his mind.''

Campaign finance records show Jeb Bush's campaign for governor in 2002 received at least $201,000 from the property insurance industry. This year, he gave legislators surprisingly little guidance on how to fix the state's troubled property insurance market.

During his State of the State speech in early March, Bush called for better hurricane preparedness but provided no direction about insurance issues, including what to do with financially troubled Citizens Property Insurance Corp. Citizens is the state-run home insurer, and now the state's biggest property insurer. Its size is a sore point the state never intended.

When Bush signed the new property insurance bill into law, he knew consumers wouldn't be happy. ``I will accept responsibility that we will have higher rates,'' Bush said.

Bush and Republican legislators made their first move when they created the Task Force on Long-Term Solutions for Florida's Hurricane Market prior to the 2005 hurricane season.

The 13-member task force conducted eight public meetings. The panel of mostly insurance industry insiders overwhelmingly recommended short-term, industry-friendly solutions, only some of which were adopted.

In a 58-page report, the task force repeatedly called for what the Florida property insurance industry wanted -- ``greater flexibility'' with regulators. ``The majority of the people on the task force had some industry tie,'' said Steve Burgess, a task force member and a consumer advocate who works under the state Office of Insurance Regulation.

`Afraid to be bold'

Some legislators, insurance industry lobbyists and analysts say lawmakers settled on the bill because of their concern about doing more harm than good.

``The single biggest issue that will cause the state's economy to stop is not handling this insurance situation correctly,'' said Sen. J.D. Alexander, a Lake Wales Republican on the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee. Records show Alexander, who helped negotiate the final bill, has accepted at least $95,000 in donations from insurance interests to his political campaigns since 1996.

Bush says Florida is better off with the law than nothing.

``It's not easy to make the tough choices,'' Bush said. ``If we had not made the tough choices this year, it would have come back to haunt us.''

Others don't see it that way.

``A lot of these issues are technical. So a lot of legislators aren't comfortable with certain things. When an insurance company lobbyist says `this and this,' it's pretty difficult for someone who is not an expert to know that they are lies,'' said Birny Birnbaum, an economist with the Center for Economic Justice, in Austin, Texas.

Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said: ``The (Florida) Legislature is afraid to be bold. They were so afraid that the industry is going to bolt that they won't take the kind of action that needs to be taken.''

Dear Governor Bush:

Our homeowners association for a 28 - unit complex of townhouses in Brevard 
County just outside the city limits of Satellite Beach received our policy  
renewals. From August 2005 to August 2006 our premiums increased from 12000 
to 49900 just for our windstorm insurance.

We are lucky that we are able to pay it. many many Floridians are not so 
lucky and face the loss of homes to forclosure. People who have worked all 
their lived to have a home for their retirement.

Something has to be done. I moved to Florida (from Alabama) five years ago. 
I love it here. But increases like this make me consider moving back.
Unfortunately, we have having a really slow real estate market right now, 
too, so selling a house to move somewhere else is really not much of an 
option either.

Floridians are smart. We can figurue out something. Help us before we get an 
even larger increase in 2007. And please, stand up to these insurance 
companies.

Sincerely,

Governor Bush,
 
Please write a blanket letter to all Fl local papers or do an ad on TV explaining to condo owners what will happen if a horrible new version of this bill is passed.
I am very much disappointed in the town hall meetings that I assumed would be in each town and be publicized well in advance so we could all organize and attend. Now, I come to find out there was one last week that no one knew about and was not publicized anywhere. What good are he town hall meetings when those whose best interest are at stake are not told about the meeting? I would venture to say that 95% of all FL condo owners have no idea what is going on with this condo bill which will essentially strip our property rights and allow more developers to steal our homes. Please, if you are going to order meetings, order the meetings to be publicized in advance and explain why it is important for condo owners to attend. Please write a letter yourself to all local papers in FL advising condo owners what is going on--no one else will. I am sure this was not your intent, to keep all condo owners in the dark so they can pass this eminent domain bill and steal our homes!Please, we are depending on you again! Help us!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My mother 's residential insurance has more than doubled....She is 76 years old and on a fixed income....She has no say so on what she can or can not cover...and she cannot, by law, go to Citizens....She is at the mercy of an an insurance company based out of state. They tell her that this is the way it is, or just don't pay, and they will cancel you and let the bank take over your property. At this time in the year, no one will touch her house...It is pure black mail...What else would you call it?  (And we have not even dealt with the new property assessments coming up)
 
She lives on a hill 100 feet above sea level...She is not near the water.
 
We need a something done. If not, perhaps in one year or less, there will be a huge sucking sound and implosion as the people leave the State. There will be a huge property devaluation which will cause kaos with county and local governments.
 
Sir, we need your help to help solve this problem.
 
I saw where you signed your last legislation a few days ago, and everyone says you are now officially a Lame Duck. I would have hoped that you at least had one more battle in you for the citizens of Florida who have adopted you, elected you Governor, and rewarded your efforts with a second term.
 
Don't abandon us now--like President Gerald Ford did to Michigan when he left office and move on to another state like a carpetbagger.
 
Please, have the courage to at least have a fight over the issues. Don't duck the problem, but have the fortitude to tackle the problem and make it a win-win for both the citizens of Florida and those insurance companies willing to stay in the game and play fair. Turn the liability problem into an asset for all the people of Florida. I know it can be done, and I trust you, the Cabinet, and the legislature to help make it happen.
 
I am a Floridian and want to remain so!

Subject:	Ocean Renewable Power Company LLC/ Florida Energy Bill for Renewable Energy/ Senate Bill 888

Dear Governor Bush, We desperately need your help in finding funding to construct a protype  of our "OcGen" moduel. I started Ocean Renewable Power Company (ORPC) two years ago in the interest of finding alternative energy sources for the State of Florida and reducing Global Warming. Our system is base loaded and uses only the power of the water current to generate electricity with NO Global Warming. We have Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses for six sites in Florida, that would harness the power of the Gulf Steam Current. To date all Research and Development has been funded by myself and other private sources.

 Being a native from Miami and the company headquartered in Miami, I am acutely aware of our energy needs and we are ready to help. However we have reached a point in our development where we need help from State funding in the amount of five million dollars in order to construct the protype. Working with Florida Atlantic University as well as our own technology team, we are well positioned to make this a commercial reality. The list of companies and agencies we have been working with includes The US Navy through Navsea Carderock  Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center as well as the Navsea South Florida Testing Facility in Dania Beach, Florida.

As you were the one behind the "Florida Energy Bill to Diversity Fuel Supply with Renewables" in addition to Senator Lee Constantine, which as we read it also contains provisions for our technology, I turn to you for support and guidance, as the process of obtaining Grants or Funding, we have no real experience with. 

I would respectively request a meeting with you in order adequately brief you on the scope of ORPC. It is important we bring this project to fruition at the earliest possible time. If you have the time, I think if you visit our web site found below, it will provide you with further creditworthy information. Once again I ask you for an early meeting and response.

EVEN IF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE ALLOWED TO ACCEPT 1/2 DOWN AND THE BALANCE IN 30 - 60 DAYS, IT WOULD EASY THE STRESS.  IT'S A PRETTY SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN THEY WANT THEIR MONEY UP FRONT BUT THEY TAKE THEIR TIME COMING TO YOUR HOME BECAUSE THEY ARE OVERWHELMED WHEN A HURRICANE COMES.

Gov. Bush,
 
    We have an emergency on our hands in Florida.  I, as well as thousands of other people in Florida, are being forced to move to another State. 
   
     I just received by Wind Insurance renewal, from a company that, apparently, bought my policy from Citizens Insurance Co.  The premium went from $601.00 (it was about $400.00 a year ago) to $1546.00   This increase, is unconscionable. 
 
    In the town of Englewood, where my Wife and I live, you can't go down a street, without seeing at least 1 or more houses for sale. I have talked to other people who are saying, that if something isn't done about this Insurance RIPOFF they will be forced to sell their house and move out of state. Not all the people in Florida are multi millionaires, and do not have the extra money to spend $1,000 to $2,000 more a year on insurance, for a modest house.
 
I ask you, for the benefit of the people of Florida, who you should have an interest in, to do something to prevent Insurance companies to get away with these outrageous increases.
 
I would appreciate a response to this letter.

Dear Governor Bush:

The Honorable Jeb Bush:

I must tell you how terribly disappointed I am with the state of FL home 
owner's insurance & tax rates in both Broward & Palm Beach Counties.  I 
recently tried to purchase a home, which is around $40K below the price I 
would be selling my current home for (yes....$40K profit), and was 
prevented from moving further due to the taxes & insurance on the new home 
(which is actually old).  Many people are having the same problem & 
something needs to be done.  My current taxes on a $460K home are $4200, 
with $2500 for insurance (6700 total).  The new home, which would cost 
$424, would have $8600 in RE taxes, with $5000-$7000 for insurance (not 
even mentioning hurricane deductibles);  a cobined total of apx $13000.  
How are people supposed to move, or even buy a home in this state?  This 
used to be an affordable place to live.  It used to be a retirement 
community.  Do you think you're improving the quality of life for PEOPLE 
here, or improving big government spending by charging these CRAZY tax 
rates for your working citizens?  Couple this issue with the GAS prices & 
HORRID electric bills (I swear they're robbing us!!!), and you have a very 
low quality of life.  The poor school system here used to be the 
compromise for the low cost of living, but now you have no excuse for the 
bad schools because you make more money than Long Island, NY here with 
home taxes.  I just don't understand & feel as if I live in a communist 
country.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING.  I heard a new tax bill was on the table, 
but that was TWO YEARS GOING now.  What is the problem?  You need to cut 
all the FREE PROGRAMS in the state & take the burden off every-day 
citizens pocketbooks.  

For the record:  I'm a voting republican, so this has nothing to do with 
party lines.  Furthermore, I love your brother, dispite the hard decisions 
he's had to make during his service.  God Bless & please take strong 
consideration of everything I've said.  PLEASE HELP US!!  

Sincerely,

I am one of the victims of the Insurance crisis as its referred to, but I call it a Crime.  Citizens Insurance is taking away peoples home and getting away with it. 
I am forced to sell my home because I cant pay the mortgage anymore, and my income per year cant compete with the rising cost of insurance.
I will sell my home if im lucky, and will leave this state because I cant afford to raise my family here any longer.
When it has come to the point of food or mortgage as a first choice of who gets paid first-- then its time to cut my losses.
Please tell Citizens Insurance they won, but if my home is one of the many foreclosures that are sure to come, they maybe Citizen will re-assess their position on what they have done to the great state of Florida and all who lived here. 
 
I was proud to be a taxpayer and a homeowner being a single parent to be able to show my kids there is a better life and an education and a good paying job will pay off someday, but not anymore. How can they afford to go to college, when right now I cant afford to even put new cloths on ther back for school. 
 
I guess until you are backed into a corner and forced to choose between the roof over your head or the empty stomachs of children, you will not understand.  I know my children will learn a valuable lesson from this, nothing is forever and hard work and honesty does not always pay off.
There is always someone  that can take it all away from you 
and leave you with nothing but broken dreams and heartache.
Please tell Citizen Insurnace , thanks,, thanks a lot.

To Governor Jeb Bush, 

I attended the "Town Hall Meeting" at Merritt Island High School last night Aug. 7,2006  which was sponsored by Florida Today Newspaper and Bob Allen,Rep. District 32. 
Home Insurance premiums increases in Florida are out of control. 
At this meeting, Steve Burgess of Tallahassee, representing the State Insurance Consumer Advocate said his recommendation was that State Farm Insurance was eligible for a 9 percent rate increase instead of the 53.7 percent increase that was permitted by the Office of Insurance Regulation. 
It is obvious to all that the people who we put our trust in, and vote into office to watch out for our interests are not doing their job. I do not buy for one instant that this is a complex problem. It is not. It is centered around greed. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM NOW ?

National marketing campaigns increase Florida produce sales 
TALLAHASSEE -- Three produce marketing campaigns conducted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services helped increase retail sales of Florida-grown agricultural products by $394.4 million over last year, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Charles H. Bronson announced Monday. 
The 2005-06 marketing campaigns -- "Global Grid," "Florida Farmers' Express" and the "Florida Watermelon Campaign" -- saw an increase in participating grocery stores, an expanded geographic area, and an increase in the number of advertisements. 
"This year's marketing promotions generated an additional $394.4 million over the previous year's increase," Bronson said. "We were again very successful in marketing 'Fresh from Florida' products to consumers throughout the United States and abroad." 
The marketing promotions, which ran from November 2005 to June 2006, are timed to coincide with Florida's important winter-spring harvest that supplies the United States with most of its domestically grown produce. 
The Global Grid campaign, now in its fifth year, included 7,684 stores and generated $324.7 million in additional retail sales. The Florida Farmers Express campaign, now in its sixth year, included 1,734 stores and generated $41.1 million in additional retail sales. The Florida Watermelon Campaign, now in its third year, included 4,293 stores and generated $28.6 million in additional retail sales. 
The three marketing campaigns spanned 43 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, five Canadian provinces, and 11 Caribbean and Central American countries. Thirty-four retail grocery chains with 13,711 individual stores participated. They featured Florida products in their circular ads 754 times, yielding 178,955 individual store ads that generated more than 8.8 billion consumer impressions. 
"We were able to drastically expand these campaigns due to their proven track record in previous years," Bronson said. "After seeing their sales increase, most retail partners eagerly signed up for another year. We also added new partners and extended the campaigns' reach into Alaska, Texas, Idaho, Oregon and Washington for the first time." 
Bronson said the continued trend of increased retail sales is good news for Florida's farmers and the state's economy. 
"Since our state's farmers know we're continually expanding markets for their products, they can plant for the future with a degree of confidence," Bronson said. "That increased agricultural production benefits our state's economy through purchases of agricultural supplies, machinery, wage expenditures, and general spending. Additionally, it's estimated that these highly successful marketing promotions helped Florida create or retain approximately 2,407 full-time jobs and generate more than $6.7 million in taxable revenues." 
The three successful marketing initiatives were joint ventures between the Division of Marketing and Development, the Florida Department of Citrus and the Florida Watermelon Association. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is statutorily mandated to provide professional marketing services to Florida's agricultural community through its Division of Marketing and Development. These marketing promotions are part of the ongoing "Fresh from Florida" campaign, an identification and promotional program designed to boost the image of Florida agriculture and increase sales by helping consumers to easily identify Florida-grown agricultural products at retail stores. The "Fresh from Florida" campaign also helps increase public awareness of the importance of Florida's agriculture industry, which has an estimated overall economic impact of more than $87 billion annually. 
Geographic scope 
The three promotions included grocery chains in 43 U.S. states (all except Arizona, New Mexico, California, Nevada, Utah, Montana and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia. The Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were also included, as well as the Caribbean and Central American nations of Aruba, Barbados, Dominican Republic, Trinidad, Jamaica, U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. 
Participating retailers 
The 34 retail grocery chains participating in the three promotions were ACME, Affiliated, Albertsons, A&P Canada, AWI Shurfine, Bi-Lo, Bozzuto's, Farm Fresh, Food Basics, Hannaford, Harvey's, Ingles, Jewel-Osco, Kash 'n' Karry, Kitchen Table, Kroger, Loeb, Lowes, Market Basket, Meijer, Metro, Nash Finch, Penn Traffic, Price Chopper, Price Smart Central America, Provigo, Publix, Roundy's, Sobey's, Sobey's Atlantic, Spartan, Ukrop's, Winn-Dixie and Waitrose UK. 
Featured produce 
The Florida produce items featured in the three promotions included bell peppers, blueberries, cabbage, carrots, celery, cucumbers, eggplant, grapefruit, melons, oranges, potatoes, radishes, snap beans, squash, strawberries, sweet corn, tangerines, tomatoes, tropical fruits and variety lettuces. 
Yearly totals of participating stores 
The combined number of retail stores participating in the 2006 and previous years' promotions were: 13,711 stores in 2006; 10,602 stores in 2005; 10,129 stores in 2004; 8,289 stores in 2003; 5,100 stores in 2002; 2,017 stores in 2001; 298 stores in 2000. 
Previous names of campaigns 
Some promotions were conducted under different names in years past, although the focus, marketing strategy and array of featured Florida products were similar. This year's "Global Grid" was named "Storming Across North America" in 2005, "PowerGrid" in 2004, and "Northern Exposure" in 2002 and 2003. This year's "Florida Farmers' Express" was named "Greetings From Your Florida Farmer" from 2000 to 2004. 
Marketing strategy 
Participating grocery chains increase their purchases of Florida products and use the "Fresh from Florida" logo in their newspaper ads and circulars. Retailers increase the size of their displays to accommodate more products. The resulting three-way "linkage" involves Florida producers, grocery retailers and the consuming public, in which: Florida producers plant, harvest and ship additional products to meet the anticipated increased demand; retail grocery corporate buyers increase their purchases of Florida products to handle the increase in sales; customers respond to the "Fresh from Florida" themes used in store advertising and increase their purchases of Florida-grown products.

Dear Governor Bush,

We are a town house community of 175 units here in beautiful Pembroke Pines.  We are a well diversified community, having young and old alike.  The majority of the owners have lived here since 1978-1979.  So many of them have concerns because of what has happened to their insurance costs.  It has become for many, out of their reach.  It is not only the Home Owners Insurance but oil, food, medical, etc.  Everything is sky rocketing and most of us do not get increases to compensate for the cost of living in Florida, especially South Florida.  Right now there are eight (8) units for sale in this complex, with "For Sale" signs going up all across South Florida.  We need your help.  We have lived here all these years because we love it but it is no longer feasible for us to continue to fight on a daily basis to enjoy our lives here.  We would rather move out of paradise and go into the cold weather then to worry about the Hurricanes and insurance to pay for damages.  Most of us are under insured because we cannot afford the premiums.  We look to you for help with this unbearable situation.  For all the years that these insurance companies collected our premiums and did not have to pay a dime to the majority of us then when several storms hit they go out of business or raise their premiums so high, one has to decide what they can give up in order to afford to pay it and most of us cannot afford to it.

We look to you and your Cabinet to turn things around and let us enjoy our families,homes and the cities we live in.  None of us ever want to leave Pembroke Pines or South Florida yet we are being forced to do so.

Very truly yours,

I am writing concerning the home owners insurance mess that is hitting FL.  I moved to St Augustine in 2004 to accept a new position with PSS World Medical.  I recently received notice from Nationwide that my homeowner’s policy would not be renewed.  IT is a 2 yr old home and I have not had any claims on this or any other property.  I do not live on any water and the ocean is at least 6-8 miles away.  

 

When I called Nationwide to get some more information, I was told that they had used some computer model and my house was selected for non-renewal.  No other information was given.

 

I have called numerous insurance companies and at this point have not had any luck in securing a new policy.  

 

This is a huge issue and will have a significant impact on keeping existing residence and attracting new people and business to the state.

 

Please let me know what can be done to correct this situation.

Subject:	Abuses of Citizens Insurance

Governor,
 
First of all I am currently a registered Republican in the State of Florida.  I only mention this so that you or who ever handles your email understands the context of my criticism.
 
The Republican part is about to lose control of Florida due to the insurance crisis.  Everytime we turn around we are all reminded as to how bad it is and how little the State of Florida is doing about it.
 
We in our community of condominiums, are now being subjected to significant abuse by the undwritting department of Citizens Insurance.  Instead of using their undwritting manual to determine the rate structure they are making up their own rules in order to rate our insurance using their much costlier "A Rate" system.
 
Under the manual rate system, the premium for  a condo association with two buildings with a total value of $2,491,000 would be about $37,374.  Even though the insured and the insured value does not meet the criteria for application of the "A Rate" system, Citizens Insurance is using the "A Rate" system anyway, resulting in a significant increase in insurance cost to the 24 residents of this association. I understand that the use of the "A Rate" system has increased the premium cost for some associations over 30%. Such unfounded cost increases will cause some residents of this 55+ community to lose their homes.  Although many residents have tried to sell their condos, the real estate market has dropped dead because of the ongoing increases of insurance.  The average market price a year ago was about $200,000; it is now about $170,000 and still going down.  Our residents are trapped.
 
This abuse of the "A Rate" system needs the attention of your office.
 
If your office does not care about this issue and do not care what Citizens Insurance is doing to the residents of this community; your office does not need to respond to my plea.  We will all understand that you do not care and even registered Republicans such as myself will understand that your office does not care about our residents nor the results of upcoming elections in the State of Florida.
 
If you office does care; please have someone contact me for more details regarding this very serious matter as well as names and contact information of those who are or have been involved it trying to protect our residents.

I contacted Sen. Bill Posey, he’s “afraid” the insurance companies will sue the state.  Bob Allen had a meeting last night on Merritt Island and 700 people attended.  We are in a crisis state and NO ONE seems to know what to do.  How many foreclosures have to take place before anything is done?  A special session should be called and all the elected officials should stay in Tallahassee until they can think of something to do.

We have just received our house insurance for a small home on Merritt Island, from Hull Insurance through Farm Bureau.  It is 2600.00, it went up 1000.00. This home is 1300 square feet, and my son and his wife live in it.  They are unable to afford this extremely high cost.  I went to Farm Bureau and they were able to reduce it by 365.00 if we increased the deductible to 5000.00 (the wind deductible went to $7750.00).  What can we do and who can help us?

To Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I attended the "Town Hall Meeting" at Merritt Island High School last night Aug. 7,2006  which was sponsored by Florida Today Newspaper and Bob Allen,Rep. District 32.
Home Insurance premiums increases in Florida are out of control. 
At this meeting, Steve Burgess of Tallahassee, representing the State Insurance Consumer Advocate said his recommendation was that State Farm Insurance was eligible for a 9 percent rate increase instead of the 53.7 percent increase that was permitted by the Office of Insurance Regulation.
It is obvious to all that the people who we put our trust in, and vote into office to watch out for our interests are not doing their job. I do not buy for one instant that this is a complex problem. It is not. It is centered around greed.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM NOW ?
 
Thank You,

My husband and I feel it is now our time! Citizens insurance has changed that. They have dropped my coverage and have turned my coverage over to HomeWise insurance. I was paying $2595.00 a year to Citizens (which I thought was an exorbitant amount) and now HomeWise is charging me $4455.00 for less coverage.

 

 Coupled with taxes, flood insurance and general liability insurance dreams of retirement area forgotten thing.

 

 

Can anything be done?

Dear Governor Bush,

I just heard on WUSF radio that you were establishing a task force to look at the insurance, shall we call it, crisis. Thank you.

We were insured with Allstate for our cars and home.  Our Homeowners and Windstorm were transferred to Citizens.  Just in this past few months, Citizens told us our Windstorm would be passed on to Florida Peninsula (but they were keeping our Homeowners).

Our Citizens Homeowners insurance went up about $200 (from 750 to 950), but that was not bad as we expected an increase. 

When we got the new policy for Florida Peninsula for our Windstorm it had gone up 250%!  From around $750 (with Citizens last year) to $1,950.00 (with Florida Peninsula).  We could not afford to pay it. 

I had saved up enough to cover a modest increase but not that much.  So we pray we won't have a Hurricane or that a thunderstorm won't drop a tree on our house.

 

We don’t have a huge income.  I am a 46 year old Sarasota Native. I have worked for the Ringling Museums in Sarasota for 16 years now.  My husband is partially retired and now works part time at Ringling in security. He is 62 and was laid off several years ago as a Software Engineer, a fall out of 9/11. His company worked for the FAA installing Wind shear alert systems at Airports, after 9/11 the FAA changed its focus. His layoff drained a good portion of our savings; no one wanted to hire a 62-year-old Senior Engineer.

 

Thank you for reading this.  And please give my regards to Marvin the First Dog.  We met when I was checking on the museum collection at the Governor’s Mansion a few years ago.

 

Most sincerely,

Subject:	Property Taxes

Like many of my neighbors and other citizens in Florida, I am a retiree whose livelihood depends on my Social Security benefit and my own personal savings.   My ability to sustain a livable existence is constantly eroded by ever increasing property taxes based on an increased appraisal of my home because of increased prices for the sale of similar newly built homes in Lake county.  At the current rate of increase, within the next six to ten years, I won't be able to afford to live in my home and will be forced to sell all I own and move into an assisted living place at the expense of Medicaid.
 
Further, although I have no children, a significant portion of my tax assessment goes to pay for educating children of other families, including those who pay no taxes at all.  

I would like you to support legislation to remedy this unfair and potentially devastating situation.  Florida law should exempt Social Security recipients from any tax assessment for schools and should prohibit increasing property valuation unless and until a property is sold.
 
If Florida doesn't do something to fix this inequity soon, politicians will face a voter revolt that will make California's Proposition 13 "debate" look tame.

Subject:	Why can't the same house in the same neighborhood have the same insurance bill?

I watched the Aug 1 cabinet meeting with Kevin McCarthy about the insurance crisis with business.  I also heard your comments about homeowners insurance.  I listened intently and I still had no answers only more questions and it seems so do you.
 
I got my bill last night and I don't understand.  I am looking to your office to get me an answer.  My insurance company seems to be as evasive and everyone else.
 
I close mortgages everyday as a notary and they usually tell me about their insurance stories.  I do many in my own neighborhood.  What I have been seeing is that the same size, same age house with a lot less improvements against wind and hurricanes are paying much less, sometime 1/3.  I just got my bill yesterday and for a 40 year old house, 1200 sf at 38 foot above sea level with no claims and only $154,000 value I am paying $3100.  Last year it doubled to $2000 from $983 and this year up $1100.  
 
WHY?
 
Why aren't the same houses in the same neighborhood, same age the same prices?  I closed a mortgage for a lady on the other side of US19 which is all flood zone, but only a mile from me and her bill this year was only $958.
 
I am tired of working a second job just to pay for the house insurance.  I didn't plan this, but we are already seeking employment in another state.  I had all intentions of living here through my retirement in the same house.  That is why I spent thousands for new windows and retrussed roofing, flood insurance even though I don't need it and doing everything I know how to do to make this a house that will last another 40 years.  Why did I do this?  

I would appreciate an answer from someone, anyone.  Please don't bother with the usual schtick, if there is no answer then don't bother replying that is only an insult to my intelligence and yours.  I'm looking for a REAL ANSWER.
 
Thank you for your time.

copy of email sent for hearing on insurance issues:
 
  
I was most please to be made aware of Friday's hearing.
Unfortunately my schedule precludes my attendance at the hearing, but I wanted to share with the panel my situation and thoughts.
 
As a small business owner I face, as I am sure many others do, the choice of closing my business and moving out of the state, or making some uncomfortable changes in my business plan/model.  I am a geriatrician in a solo private practice focusing on providing high quality medical care to people as they age. We have a small office practice and spend a good part of the week taking care of seniors where they live. I currently lease office space at a local hospital and have been trying to buy a small property to move my practice.
 
I have been informed that my Business Owner's Insurance Policy will not be renewed due to the insurance crisis in the state, and have not been able to secure financing to purchase a building, due to the inability to obtain/afford commercial property and/or hurricane insurance.
 
How can we continue to service the public, provide high quality services, and stay in business with the ever increasing costs of doing business?
 
Why do we allow the Insurance industry to assign Florida as it's own risk adjusted rate pool different than the rest of the country combined?  Is this fair?  The concept of risk adjustment is to spread the risk across the "whole" population, not select out those perceived as the highest risk.  For decades property insurers have reaped huge profits.  When catastrophes have struck  we have had re-insurance and excess pools to bail us out in the past.
 
For my situation this is certainly a cross-over issue with medical insurance issues, reimbursements not keeping up with inflation, and other cost issues, but if we cannot protect ourselves from general liability or create equity by owning commercial property, how can we continue to care for your parents and the seniors in our community?
 
The alternatives will be large corporate entities with deep pockets providing impersonal, but highly "efficient" health care, and much continued dissatisfaction in the community.
 
I call on our representatives to challenge the status quo, enable Insurers to continue to make acceptable profits, but allow the small providers of service to continue to flourish, or I fear those of us with an entrepreneurial spirit will continue to stray for the quick buck, and unnecessary medical interventions will continue to flourish, rather than stay focused on the quality driven care we deserve and require.
 
Thank you for taking this time to listen and I hope and pray we can resolve this issue in the very near future.

Govenor Bush:  First off, do you really get your messages or does your staff weed through them? This is important issues that you need to hear from your constituents,  I read where there is a draft proposal to create a Commercial JUA in the works because businesses can't get insurance.  What about the homeowner's that can't get insurance? 
 
 We are being cancelled in the middle of storm season after 30 years with Nationwide of Florida because we have a mobilehome.  We have never had any wind damage and we are Senior Citizens that we either end up paying more than double to have insurance in the States entity, Citizens Property Ins. or have no insurance at all.  Was this the intent of the legislators to go into the insurance business? Because thats exactly what they have created.    It seems since Hurricane Andrew the more the state tries to fix things, the worse it gets.  Maybe if the insurance companies could have raised their rates years ago in the high risk areas, we wouldn't be having this situation today. I think it is a sad time that Seniors have to go without homeowner insurance because of the bureaucratic mess the politicians have made in this state.  You look at all the politicians  platforms and they are going to fix the insurance crisis and I say "hog/wash" as they have been promising that for over 14 years. People are having to sell their homes and move to another state.   One of the candidates for CFO says we need to stop letting the insurance companies "drive the bus", but it sure looks like we are at their mercy. 
 
I have called agents and  called companies that are licensed to write MH only to find out that they are not writing any new business.  I thought about trying the Surplus Lines market, but don't know who to call for that type of coverage.  Our biggest concern is we can't even just purchase liability insurance.  If our home burns to the ground I guess we will not only be Senior Citizens without insurance, but we will be homeless.  This doesn't say much for the State of Florida looking out for it's residential policyholders and voters, does it?

Reference the story below on Fox's channel 11 news in West Palm Beach dated Monday, August 7, 2006. 
 
Dear Governor, 
I was just watching the local news and heard, yet again, another Citizens Homeowner Nightmare. A resident's homeowners insurance dropped him because he lives within five miles of the water. So, over a barrel, the man calls Citizens Homeowners Insurance. Their premium----$8000!!!!!!!!!!  His other insurance company charged $3000---which I find rediculous, but relatively speaking, it's the norm. The man could lose his house because of this. Keep in mind this is for $125k worth of insurance! If that isn't the most blatant case of price gouging then there just isn't any such thing.  
Think about that! That's over a thousand dollars a month if you figure the cost is directly related to hurricanes! Hurricane season is only six months!
I hear stories on a weekly basis about peoples' nightmares dealing with Citizens. Knowing that the bad is all I'm going to hear on the news, I think the $8000 premium more than tips the scales against any good they might be doing.
How the hell are people supposed to afford a house when 1/3 of the mortgage is tax and insurance? If we have another year like 2004, you can make that 1/2 the mortgage if not more. 
I think soon you will start to see more and more people looking at Paradise in their rearview mirror. 
sincerely,
Todd Bonjour

Mr. Bush,
 
    I wrote some time back about two issues that are still weighing on me. The first was F-CAT testing. I got the all purpose email back trying to reassure me that F-CAT test were not taught but that all skills were taught. Anyway even though I don't believe a word of what was sent the second issue of insurance and more specifically home owners was never responded to.
 
    I will again attempt to get this to you. Many companies have stopped writing home owners insurance here in Florida. Even more so home owners insurance for mobile homes is almost non-existent. We were canceled by Liberty fire and casualty back in April of this year. They stated they were not writing mobile homes any longer. This is a company we paid for five years and never had a claim. This insurance was costing $950.00/yr.
 
    On the notice of the cancellation we began to shop insurance and found one company here in Florida still writing insurance that wasn't state funded. This was Tower Hill insurance. At the cost of $1800.00 . We got notice again this week of this company canceling us. They also don't want to do mobile homes. We have called numerous places again today and found Citizens which is the state backed company they want $2500.00 and don't cover theft and other things. The other company was Lloyds of London. At $2500.00 they did not cover any type of wind damage Hurricane, Tornado etc. The insurance also only covers replacement cost of the home, no contents, no out buildings, nothing.
 
    Here is my beef so to speak. Why? Why? Why? Insurance is money put aside by many to cover cost to the few. I know we had a bad season last year. However there has never been a Hurricane in history come through Chiefland Florida. There have been some tornados spawned off the hurricanes that caused some damage many years ago. But no hurricanes and no lose of life etc. from an actual hurricane. I know many insurance companies paid out a great deal of money last year with Katrina and other storms. I guess they want us to believe out of all the millions if not billions of dollars they each took in premiums last year they had to pay out more than they received. Even if that were true we all know that insurance companies take our money and make more with it by investing etc. The last I checked Florida wasn't destroyed last year. Most of Florida received very little to no damage from the storms. Were the profit margins not high enough to offer us unworthy folks insurance this year? Even if every mobile home in Florida was destroyed by hurricanes it wouldn't cost as much to replace them as it would if say 25% of stick built homes were destroyed. Are they not insuring us because they had too much tied up in beach front condos, motels and other commercial stuff? 
 
    If you are an insurance company and sell insurance for cars and homes isn't that discrimination? Not much difference than being black or white male or female. I would love to have a business were I could choose what I did and didn't want to take a risk on. No other business works that way large or small. All take risk everyday. It has got to stop somewhere. Working people can't afford over $3.00/gallon gasoline and pay these insurance rates. We have to have insurance or the banks will take our homes. I guess I would like to see who the bank can get to insure it.
 
    You are my Governor I voted for you. I got a president that you probably know. Voted for him also. I would like some insight or reassurance from you something is being done. If insurance companies registered to do business in Florida only want to pick and choose why not let them pick and choose another state altogether and sell nothing in Florida. If they can't insure the majority of the people why let them make even one nickel here? We can't buy car insurance from any other state but Florida. The vehicle registration people won't give you a license plate, regardless how much insurance you have. Makes it kind of convenient for Florida insurers to get some of our money huh?
 
    I'm really upset with this whole thing. I really would like to hear from you.

Right now the idea of offshore drilling for oil is being debated in Washington.  What Washington 
 
comes up with Florida will have very little to say about it. 
 
 
Why don't we sell off shore drilling rights to the large US Oil producers at a safe

off set the cost of our natural disasters.  Subsidizes home owner insurance  in the

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush:

The citizens of Florida need help now with their homeowners insurance premiums.  We carry State Farm insurance and my premiums have gone from $1,400 a year to $5,400 last year and up another $662.52 this year.  That is over $6,000 a year to cover our home and with huge deductibles. We have never submitted a claim against our policy.  We live in the Destin/Panama City part of the state which did not receive the kind of damage other areas received from storms during the past two years.  The damage here was mainly to homes right on the beach due to severe beach erosion.

Our agent just told me that the state has approved a rate hike of 112% for next year.  Can this be true???  HELP!  How will we ever be able to pay these premiums?  Is our only hope to sell our home in this depressed market and move out of Florida?  I can see a mass exodus out of Florida when this becomes common knowledge after November.   How will anyone be able to buy a home here, especially those of us that are retired and living on a fixed income?

Please respond to this urgent cry for help.

    Dear Sir,
 
        I know you probably don't have time for me, but I must try something.  I just got notification that my premiums to insure my house in Clearwater are now required to cover the entire cost of rebuilding.  My home is appraised at just a little over $100,000, and now Citizens is demanding it be insured for $400,000.  
        I only make $12 an hour.  I have no more money.  I will not be able to pay the extra.  Please tell me how I am to save my home.  I can now barely make ends meet, and the extra on my mortgage will be too much.  I just plain don't have that kind of money.  And this is a law that requires me to pay.  This law is taking my home.  That's not America.

Subject:	[*] Insurance Woes

 
The Honorable Kevin McCarty
Florida Office of Insurance Regulation
200 East Gaines Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399

Dear Commissioner McCarty,

When I saw my home owners policy premium jump from $5189 to $ 8429 this year  I wanted to scream. Instead I decided to educate my self as much as I could about this insurance business. 

 

First question: How does Gulfstream calculate my premium? 

Long Answer: The question of how premiums are calculated seems to be a closely guarded secret of insurance companies and not one they are very willing to reveal. What I found by completing the  "Homeowners Premium Calculation Worksheet" (no easy matter given that the only person I found qualified to help me was Dan Hulchanski, Director of Marketing for Gulfstream) was that there are a tremendous amount of variables that go into the calculations and therefore there is a huge risk of errors, (as I found in Gulfstream's calculation of my wind storm mitigation credit which was off by +20%.)  Even more disturbing I found that Gulfstream was now charging me a 20% surcharge due to the age of my home which was built in 1926. I find this item particularly troublesome because my home has been completely renovated since 1926 (obviously.)  Other than the external walls everything has been updated or renovated including the roof and windows, plumbing, electrical and heating/cooling. Yet when my renewal policy arrived neither my agent nor the insurance company told me my home now included this surcharge, nor did they give me any indication of how I could have it removed or reduced.

Short Answer: It’s very complicated, we don’t have time to explain it. Just shut up and pay your bill or we will cancel your policy. And if there are errors good luck finding them.

 

Second question: Was the increase authorized by the Florida Dept. of Insurance? 

Long answer: I went to the http://www.fldfs.com/edms/  and looked up Gulfstream. I was able to gather that yes indeed, Gulfstream had applied for a 57% increase in premiums and was approved by the dept. of insurance. What struck me however is that all policies in FL are divided by territory into wind and non-wind perils. In my case I am in Territory 034 (Dade, excluding Miami Beach) where windstorm coverage accounts for 66% of the premium. The rest of the premium includes "all other perils". However "all other perils" risk have not increased 57% as far as I know anywhere in FL. So why did the Dept. of Insurance approve an across the board increase of 57% instead of just increasing the windstorm coverage premium by 57%. In effect an increase of 57% in the total premium equals an increase of in the windstorm coverage of 186% if "all other perils" remains the same from the previous year. 

Short answer: Yes, but they raised the rates for “all perils” including windstorm and non-windstorm equally. It’s like saying because the price of gas has gone up 30% in the last year, you can expect to pay 30% more for everything else you buy as well. 

 

Third Question: What do I need an agent for?

Lon Answer: According to my investigations, Gulfstream pays 21.3% of the premiums they collect to insurance agents as commission. So in my case $8429 * 21.3%=$1795. This is particularly outrageous. With the premiums as high as they are, in addition, we the consumers are expected to subsidize insurance agents. Especially given that my agent does absolutely nothing for me. He couldn't even answer my questions regarding the Worksheet as I explained above. Regulators have really missed the boat on this one. We should be allowed to buy our policies directly from the insurance companies and reap the savings ourselves and cut out this middle man. At the very least commission percentages should be reduced given the huge increase in premiums in the past few years.

Short answer: I don’t. This is a boondoggle and a waste of my premium dollar. Period. 

 

Conclusion: It is obvious that we have an insurance crisis. And by crisis I mean we the homeowners of Florida are in crisis because insurance companies have jacked up our premiums to the point that we can no longer afford our homes. In conclusion:

 

1.	Rises in premiums should only reflect the increase in Windstorm coverage, not across the board coverage of all perils, and base class premiums should be the same for all counties, or at the very least averaged so we all pay equally. 
2.	Insurance companies must be forced to show how premiums are calculated and must inform consumers about specific ways in which premiums can be reduced, either through credits or coverage options. They should be required to send each policy owner a completed "Homeowner Premium Calculation Worksheet" upon renewal, which would explain the source of every $ spent on the policy. 
3.	Consumers should not be forced to buy insurance through insurance agents especially when agents are receiving up to 25% of every premium dollar we pay. 
4.	If the government of Florida does not get involved in a positive way to resolve this crisis they will in fact kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. If we homeowners cannot afford to pay to insure our homes than we will be forced to sell (haven’t you noticed all the “For Sale” signs lately?). But no one in their right mind is going to buy.  So what will happen is that property values will deflate, property taxes will decline and eventually this state will go bankrupt. 
5.	The federal government should be pressed to intervene in this crisis as soon as possible. As I have shown above it is the Windstorm coverage that has increased so significantly and the Feds should be required to subsidize this coverage.

I would like to hear your comments regarding these issues. Please contact me by email at Chafu@msn.com

Subject:	Home Owners Insurance Dilema

Dear Governor Bush:
I, like many Floridians, have had a painful increase in my homeowner's insurance - the costs have been rising steadily over the past several years and this year was particularly painful.  Although, my insurer first wrote to drop me from their coverage, two months later, they wrote back to say that they would cover me for one more year.  During that time, I researched other companies and found only one who might cover me.  One other possibility disappeared because my home is more than 30 years old.
 
In discussing this with a neighbor, he mentioned that he had been dropped and was now covered by Citizens.  He also said that Citizens pays a commission to agents to write their policies.
 
Well now, my question:  If Citizens is basically the default insurer, why does it pay a commission to agents for writing policies?  Now I don't want to deprive any agent of income, however, I recognize that most of them have multiple lines and therefore, will still be able to eat and pay their rent.
 
I don't have a clue as to the amount of commission, but a token fee for paperwork sounds much more reasonable, especially since I am having to pay a surcharge to cover Citizens' excesses.
 
Does Citizens pay a commission?  If so, how much?  If so, why?
 
Thank you, Jane Gomez

Subject:	[*] Non-Renewal of Insurance Notice

Dear Governor Bush:
I just received a notice that my homeowners policy will not be renewed this November because Vanguard Fire & Casualty "is reducing exposure to catastrophic hurricanes". I received the same letter last year but they had to renew me due to FL law, now, they are going to not renew me, This is an injustice. For years FL residents have paid these companies large sums of money in premiums but now we are being dropped. We did our part but now they don't want to do theirs. It is not right to allow insurance companies to make money but allow them not to accept their losses. Please put a stop to this abuse and help create laws that obligate insurance to accept their losses. Help us get affordable insurance without having to struggle to find a company that will cover us.
Thank you!

The State of Florida has done nothing to ensure that the Insurance industry is not overcharging its customers. In fact, the legislature seems to be able to ignore this problem or rather handle it merely by going on vacation. The condo in which I reside has had its insurance premium go from about $190,000.00 to $500,000 per year. That is a hardship, particularly to those who have retired, have families or parents they have to help. I believe that leadership is not in just talking. I believe that leadership would put the kebash on those companies that are overcharging or the legislature who allow the insurance industry to write the rules on how they will do business in this state. Time has come to do something. The time has come to straighten out this mess.

   I am writing to you to ask for your help in acquiring an Insurance policy that I can afford.  Citizens turned me over to Security First Ins. and my premium more than doubled from $2600 annually to $5361 annually.  I am retired with an income of $806 monthly from Social Security and my daughter and her children live with me and between the two of us we pay a $1538.21 a month mortgage along with all the usual bills.  We barely get by as it is and it is impossible for us to pay all that money for Homeowners Ins, but we have to have it.  Even with payments of $465 a month with the mortgage, utilities, food, gas, dental and medical costs, misc. living expenses, etc.,  it is virtually impossible to pay for such a high premium.
 
Could you please offer an affordable solution!!??
 
                   Sincerely and in distress,
 
                      Audrey J. Sheets

Governor Bush, 

First, I truly appreciate the kind of leader you are for Florida and I am sorry that term limits will prohibit you from running again.  I also appreciate you brother as our President.  The two of you have are great leaders.

I am writing because I am very concerned about the increase of costs for insurance, power, taxes, etc. - it seems that we see major increases almost daily.  We were going to increase our insurance to cover the current value of our home but with the increases we can't afford to do so.  State Farm increased our insurance by $500.00 THEN approached the state about allowing them to increase their costs and were allowed to add an additional 52%.  That is incredible - highway robbery!!  Then FPL was approved to charge us an additional 19% right in the middle of summer.  Gas prices are seemingly rising by the minute and now with the Alaskan pipeline situation it's just going to get worse.  Not to mention the medical increases - doctors, tests, MEDICATIONS.  Salaries cannot keep up with ALL of these increases.  Our county, state and federal governments are the only ones that can help "THE PEOPLE".  And we need help from all the gouging business's that profit from situations the people have no control over.

I really do appreciate you and I'm not one to fuss, but there has got to be a stopping place. 

Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] Lack of Insurance

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am a small contractor building 20 one bedroom condo's in Orange Park.  The problem is I cannot find any insurance to cover these buildings once completed.
 
My insurance company "Bush-Thompson" of Orange Park; 904.278.4288, states that there are no companies writing policies and the ones are their fees are astronomical!
 
This is crazy!
 
I tried writing to Insurance Commissioner McCarthy, but he does not publish any email addresses (smart man) and you cannot get through via phone!
 
I have over three quarters of a million dollars of my personal money tied up in this project and am at a stand still until I can find insurance.
 
I need some answers, I know you have your hands full and this is a major item on your desk, but that does not help me.
 
I am really venting, but I have no solutions or ideal where to turn, I thought maybe you could shed some light on this problem and if there are any relief in the near future.
 
Sincerely,

I cannot believe that you are considering adding another insurance to the
already overburdened home owners to help pay for insurance to those
businesses along the coastal area.  It is bad enough that we are paying
to insure the homes of the rich so they can enjoy the privilege of living
on the coast.

WE ARE SICK OF PAYING EVERYONE ELSE'S BILLS--Insurance, phones, food,
housing, health, etc. 

Please think again about how we the taxpayers and home owners feel about
the government spending more or what is supposed to be our money.

Thank you,

Subject:	Unfair Business Practice:  Homeowner's Insurance

Dear Governor Bush:
I am distressed that consumers like myself who want to change insurance carriers are unable to do so unless we've been uninsured for one year.  After the insurance company raised my premium by 300% to $5,500 with a $2,900 deductable -- an outrageous amount for coverage of a simple dwelling in East Hialeah, I tried to shop around for competitive prices and was refused new insurance because my home is currently insured. This is an unfair business practice that robs consumers of our rights to a competitve market.  I urge you to put a halt to this despicable practice so that Florida residents can pay just, competitive prices for the insurance that we need. Also, please advise how I can get insurance at a reasonable cost immediately.  Thank you in advance for your reply.
Respectfully,
Mercedes Mont

Dear Govenor Bush,
 
First I want to thank you for being there for the people of Florida during hurricane season. I was fortunate enough not to have alot of damage from the storms that devastated so many.
I am writing you about another crisis that will is happening now and that is the transfer of homeowners insurance to Citizens Insurance.
We were former customers of Tower Hill Insurance, a subsidiary of AAA Insurance. Our rate went from $800 to $2,700!!
I am a reasonable person, I understand that the rates would rise due to all the damage in Florida, but this is unacceptable!
What about elderly people on a fixed income? What about people who have worked all their lives and just want to retire here?
The thing that really bothers me most is the helpless feeling and not even being able to have a choice in the matter.
How did this happen and is there any other company that is set up to help?
 
Signed,
Kathy Childress

ATT'N : Kevin M McCarty -  FL Insurance Commissioner  
 
Dear Commissioner McCarty :                                              
 
Busy times at the Office of Insurance Regulation, so I shall be as concise as possible.                                                        
1) Business / Homeowner property insurance buyers in "Citizens" WIND/ HURRICANE policies do not  have  BUSINESS INCOME and/or ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE coverage options ! They should.  
                    
2)Business Property Owners with multiple locations in "Citizens" have to buy individual policy's for each location. ABSURD; no logical reason why a business entity cannot have one "Master Policy"  covering all scheduled insured locations . LESS expense and administrative time for "Citizens" and policy holders!
 
3) The concept of "Citizens" and the recent reactivation of the Commercial Joint Underwriting Association being "short-term" responses to a crisis possibly should be reevaluated. As reported in the media ; Cecil Pearce a Vice President of the American Insurance Association (Representing more than 400 insurance companies) hopes the Joint Underwriting Association won't be a long-term player .We know how the insurance industry responded recently : that is why we have a CRISIS !!! The time may be right for the State of Florida  via legislation ,etc. to control the destiny of the Property Insurance dilema for Property Owners . A well designed 'COOPERATIVE"   Property Insurance Plan for Business/Homeowner Interests fostered by the State Legislature could be more ideal than the cycles of the insurance industry machinations !!!!                       & amp; nbsp;  
 
4) It is also possible that the "ECONOMIES of SCALE' could be achieved via practical alliances/Joint Ventures  with the other GULF STATES ( AL, LA, MS & TX ) ; certainly worth exploring .                                         
 
The aforementioned thoughts are from a retired commercial insurance broker ( Marsh & McLennan) who transacted business on behalf of a good cross-section of the Fortune 1000 Companies . Thirty years experience in the insuranc industry -have seen many crisises in the Property /Liability disciplines !                                          
 
                                   Respectfully yours ,

Below is the text of a constituent letter that President Lee is sending out from his district office – attached are the letters he reference in the correspondence.

President Lee said you would be expecting this e-mail.

Sincerely,

Kathy Mears

 

Thank you for contacting my office to share your thoughts on the property insurance crisis facing our state. Like you, I have experienced some of the consequences of Florida’s eight major storms during the 2004 – 2005 hurricane seasons, causing nearly $40 billion in damages to our state. My insurance company has cancelled coverage on more than one of my business properties, and I have been forced to find new coverage at an increase of 330%. The impacts are staggering, and it is doubtful that our families and businesses can hold up much longer under the incredible weight of the current market.

 

Contrary to critics, many of whom are using the insurance crisis for political gain,   Florida leaders have already begun the process of reform by proposing both long-term and immediate solutions. Our situation will not be resolved with sound bites, rhetoric, or election year promises; we must draw upon the expert advice of business leaders, consumer advocates, and policy makers across our state to provide the wisdom and insight needed to rebuild a strong, affordable, and sustainable insurance market in Florida.

 

To that end, I asked Governor Bush to commission a task force on Property and Casualty Insurance Reform – comprised of non-insurance industry business leaders and consumer advocates. I suggested the group meet while the legislature is not in session in order to receive and evaluate policy options, provide the public a forum for testimony and suggestions, and ensure that recommendations are responsible and actuarially sound.  Most importantly, the committee would deliberate in a non-political environment so that the needs of Floridians, rather than divisive partisanship, would be the paramount motivation for action.

 

Governor Bush agreed to assemble the reform committee and appointed the members along with Chairman Toni Jennings on July 26.  I immediately sent a letter to the newly appointed group asking them to evaluate several proposals. I have attached the letter for your review.  

 

In addition to the reform committee proposals, I recently asked Governor Bush to consider activating a Joint Underwriting Association for commercial property. This entity has the potential of providing insurance to commercial property owners who cannot find private coverage, thus ensuring that our economic engine will not come to a screeching halt during this crisis. The letter to Governor Bush is also attached for your review.

 

Finally, regarding a Special Legislative Session, I stand ready to call the Senate back to Tallahassee to debate and pass legislation relating to property insurance. However, it is premature to convene a session before there is some consensus as to the proper course of action. To do so would invite divisive and wasteful partisan bickering, and would detract from the problem-solving mission that is now underway.

 

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your personal observations and concerns.  Please know that I have great compassion for what you are experiencing and that you have my sincere commitment to do everything I can to help restore a property and casualty insurance market that is affordable for Florida’s families and businesses. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can provide you with information, assistance, or receive your insurance reform proposals for consideration.

 

Sincerely,

 

Tom Lee

Is the current crisis in commercial and home residence insurance is going to force me to close down operations ?  We are facing an unprecedented and unjustified increases in our commercial insurance!  I am not sure if it is price gouging,  if it is not  then please tell me what is?  Insurance profits are at all time highs and record setting!   It will mean closing down my fledgling B&B operation.   I suppose not a big deal since my room tax and sales tax are small in comparison.   Nonetheless it certainly is an economic crisis for the entire state.   We need some forceful assertive and responsible action.    Thank you for your help.

Subject:	Hurricane Insurance in Monroe County

Dear Governor, Insurance Commissioner and former Insurance Commissioner:
 
As a resident, homeowner, and insured in Monroe County, I am asking if there is any relief from these excessive hurricane rate increases?  
 
We completed our 155 MPH safe home in June of 2002.  It was engineered to stay standing in a category five hurricane.  Not only was it built beyond the required code, but the main flour of the house is 16.5 feet above mean high water.  Although our flood insurance has increased, it has been "tolerable."  But our June hurricane insurance in 2004 was $2000.   Then in 2005 it doubled to $4000.  This June is doubled again to $8000.  
 
We have not increased the insurance to cover the actual value of the house.   This is on a value of less than $400,000.
 
That's $667 per month just for hurricane insurance....   that does not cover home owners or flood which are also required by lenders.
 
Please let me know you received this message.
 
Thank you,
Donna and Andrew Bott

Dear Sir

            I have some complaints and I hate to be one of those people who complain so I will also give what I hope may be a possible solution as well.

            Over the weekend I have receive a new Bill for insurance that has gone from $1400 to $3300. This is obliviously an unacceptable increase for any product. Between gas price increases and insurance the actual out of pocket increases to my household will be around $400 a month. 

            Insurance Co. stock holders and executives have obviously taken huge profits in years past but have not kept adequate reserves on hand to cover their policy holders. I do realize that we have had some extenuating circumstances, but they have been collecting for many years with no real large payouts to have drained what should have been a mandatory amount of reserves on hand.

            I for one would have no problem with a state run insurance agency. Where there would be no profit taking or CEOs to receive payouts in the millions or stock holders demanding high returns on the dollar invested. I do realize that we do have one now but we are not even eligible for it if a commercial carrier will cover us at any price. One more thing is that part of my increase is $186.00 to help pay for the service I cant use maybe its just me but that dose not seem right.  I think they call that taxation with out representation. 

 

            One last note on the gas issue. Some times we the people have to step in and control big business instead of the other way around. I have done some research on my own into alternative fuel and although I realize that my knowledge may be limited I have a few points of common sense seem to apply.

 

1.      Buying product form unstable governments and putting money in their pockets to fuel their economy and war machines just don’t make sense at any cost.

2.      If we are going to refuse to get off petroleum products and continue to use them then we should take the Eco risk and drill and supply our own.(not a option I want either BUT we cant have our cake and eat it too)

3.      Hydrogen can be obtained from water using electricity. Electricity can be had from solar cells and sun shine is something we have plenty of , Hydro dams, Cole fired plants and nuclear plants among others.

4.      The byproduct from burning hydrogen is water.

5.      The cost to upgrade newer autos to accept this fuel is now minor with the price of gas being so high.

6.      With record profits being taken by the fuel Co’s they can afford to pay for the new infrastructure. I as a tax payer would have no problem chipping into this if it would mean long term reduction in pollutions and actual fuel costs.

7.      If we do not force the gas CO’s  to convert to different fuels they will not.

 

Recently I watched a show on TV on a test site somewhere in Europe with a hydrogen gas station with solar cells supplying the electricity to extract the hydrogen from tap water and a small fleet of cars using it. So the technology already exists. If I owned one of these stations I could charge $1 a gallon and still make a killing.

 

As a favor you could forward this to your brother.

Dear Governor Bush,
	My home insurance has more than doubled this year putting a large 
financial strain on my family.   I'm am confused as to why the 
insurance company was allowed to double it's fees in one year.  I also 
do now understand why I am limited to ONE company because my house was 
built in 1953.  Citizen's will not insure me because they sold my 
policy to First Home and now First Home has more than doubled their 
fees.  Is this not a monopoly?  I thought that was illegal.  Would you 
please shed some light on this subject for me.  Thanks you for your

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
Well the current property insurance situation in the State of Florida has finally hit home for me as well as my family and friends just as it has done for thousands of other Florida residents in the past few years.
 
I look after an 89 year old lady who has no family.  A very sweet lady who retired to FLorida and has been a full time resident of this state for 30 some years.  At this point she has pretty much depleted her savings and relies on her meager pension and social security checks that up until now has gotten her through.  She manages to pay her bills including taxes, health, food and maintain her home, electric and phone bills.  That is up until now.  On Saturday she received her annual letter from her insurance company.  This year it was a cancellation notice and offer from Citizens to insure her home for a premium in the amount of $3,500.00 a year for her home that I would value at about $100,000.00.
 
Let me do the math for you.  This is $300.00 per month for someone with virtually no savings left and survives on about $1,000.00 per month.
 
I would like to know from you and our other elected State Officials what people like this are supposed to do.
 
I can envision this State in a few years when probably about 20% of us are able to afford property insurance and we are hit with a major hurricane.  Our cities and towns will be left devastated and our citizens and residents and property owners will have no choice but to walk away and hopefully start over somewhere else, more than likely in another State.  For our seniors in most cases this will not be financially possible.  How then will we handle this mess.
 
I believe that most of our over paid elected officials need to be made aware of how many of the rest of us Floridians survive.  A $3, 500.00 annual property insurance bill is not in the equation.
 
Please feel free to pass my comments along to anyone or any governmental agency that you feel need to know how not only myself but I am sure thousands of other Floridians stand on the State of our Insurance predicament.

State-run Citizens Property Insurance now a troubled giant 

By Kathy Bushouse
South Florida Sun-Sentinel

August 7, 2006


Florida never intended to be in the property insurance business this long.

When legislators created a state-run company in 1992 to offer homeowner's insurance after Hurricane Andrew, the expectation was private insurers would rebound and render the so-called insurer of last resort unnecessary.

It didn't happen.

Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the successor to the state's original insurance company, is now the largest property insurer in Florida. When created in 2002, it was one of the most important moves by the Legislature to salvage the homeowner's insurance market in the state.

Without Citizens, many Floridians wouldn't have hurricane insurance for their homes. In recent years, the growing reluctance by private insurers to write new policies while shedding thousands of customers led to the rapid expansion of Citizens. That has saddled Citizens with Florida's riskiest properties -- many along the coast or in sinkhole-prone areas.

Citizens is now "part of the economic engine of the state," said the company's deputy director, Susanne Murphy. "That engine would sputter and die if there weren't a source of homeowner's coverage for people who want to move here."

System overhaul

Legislators have given Citizens more than a few tune-ups since 2002. After many Floridians balked at paying for Citizens' $516 million shortfall in 2004, legislators this year changed the pricing to bring rates in line with the company's risk. Now Citizens premiums are more than doubling for some South Floridians.

Customers complained the company was too slow handling storm claims after the 2004 season, triggering a state audit and an overhaul.

Citizens took another beating in 2005 after allegations that a former executive took bribes in exchange for promising lucrative claims-adjusting contracts to a Texas company. And the state-run insurer reported a $1.7 billion deficit last year that all Florida property owners will have to pay this year.

Still, supporters say the state couldn't have survived the last two hurricane seasons without the protection Citizens provides policyholders abandoned by private insurers.

"We've had some bumps ... but [Citizens] was never designed to cover 1.2 million policyholders, which is what they've got right now," said Tom Gallagher, the state's chief financial officer who, as insurance commissioner, lobbied for Citizens' creation.

"Our first responsibility is to have insurance available, and we wouldn't have it if it wasn't for Citizens."

There are insurance experts who say Citizens has contributed to Florida's insurance woes. Because Citizens is supposed to insure homeowners who can't find private coverage, analysts say, it has encouraged building in risky coastal areas -- in South Florida, for example -- where private companies won't sell policies.

Citizens "encouraged irresponsible development," said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit trade group. "Citizens basically insures anyone, no matter how risky the property or high value the property is."

That has increased the state-run insurer's exposure to hurricane risk, Hartwig said.

State Sen. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, said the Legislature made a mistake in allowing private insurers to reduce their hurricane wind risk for areas east of Interstate 95. Legislators were told this would help keep insurers in Florida because they wouldn't have to insure homes closest to the ocean.

"It didn't do that," Klein said. But it did increase the number of homes covered by Citizens.

Sore points

During this year's state legislative session, lawmakers took steps to make sure Citizens' shortfalls don't affect non-customers in the future. But the Legislature did nothing to hasten its demise. As legislators try to help shore up Citizens, another sore point has become significant.

Analysts and legislators have criticized a program that gives bonus money to private Florida insurers that agree to take Citizens' homeowner's policies.

Known as the takeout program, it was created in 1995 to curb growth in Citizens' predecessor, the Joint Underwriting Association. Private insurers could earn $100 for each homeowner's policy taken from the association. The program didn't work at first. After its creation, the underwriting association reached a peak of more than 935,000 policies in September 1996.

Then private insurers took the state's homeowner's policies en masse. The bonus money was attractive and no hurricanes made landfall. By the end of 1999, the association slimmed down to about 67,000 homeowner's policies -- the vast majority in South Florida.

More than 1 million policies were taken out of the underwriting association from 1995 to 2000. "I think that was a hugely successful program," said Murphy, who as the state's deputy insurance commissioner helped create the takeout program.

Had Citizens still insured all of those homes, Murphy said, Citizens' deficits from the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons could have been much more than the collective $2.2 billion.

Takeout troubles

The takeout program left many Floridians covered by small private insurers who struggled to pay hurricane claims the past two years.

"One of the big concerns that I've had for years is that a big storm comes along and it will put most of these little takeout companies out of business," said state Sen. Steve Geller, D-Hallandale Beach, vice chairman of the state Senate Banking and Insurance Committee.

Even though the small companies meet state minimum financial requirements, "most of their business is concentrated in certain areas," Geller said, rather than spreading their risk throughout the state.

There was overwhelming support for the takeout incentive program when legislators approved it in 1995. It passed unanimously in the Senate; only two members of the House voted against it.

Legislators assumed bigger companies would take advantage of the bonuses from Citizens, said Geller, who voted for it when he was in the House.

"We didn't realize at the time that what you were going to get were these thinly capitalized companies," Geller said.

Instead, many new insurers formed to take advantage of the bonuses -- with mixed results.

Two of the biggest participants, Atlantic Preferred Insurance Co. and Southern Family Insurance Co., were deemed insolvent in April, and state regulators recently took control of their operations. The insurers were subsidiaries of Tampa-based Poe Financial Group, one of the largest property insurers in South Florida. Poe has a third company, Florida Preferred Insurance, also forced under state control.

Private insurers that took homeowner's policies from Citizens needed to have at least $5 million in cash. Some legislators and state insurance officials say that's inadequate. During this year's legislative session, certain legislators said the small insurers holding former Citizens policies are unable to cover major hurricane damage.

That makes Murphy bristle. "They need to change their law," she said. "The law said $5 million. ... They need to make up their minds what they want."

Earlier this year, legislators tweaked the takeout program so that insurers must wait five years rather than three to collect a bonus for taking policies from Citizens. And Citizens has to track property policies taken by private insurers, to see whether they end up back with the state insurer.

Even though Geller thinks the so-called takeout insurers should have more capital, he's hesitant to try to change the program now because he fears that would shrink the state's fragile insurance market.

Many of these smaller takeout companies are among the few insurers selling new property insurance policies in South Florida. "I'm not prepared to do something today that would take more capacity out of the South Florida market," he said.

Thank you for addressing the insurance crisis in Florida in the latest vote to activate a state reinsurance pool to support private property insurance for Florida businesses.  

However, please consider a moratorium on insurers who pick and choose what to sell in Florida.  It should be all or nothing.  The state fund will certainly create a more competitive atmosphere for insurers if they are required to offer all insurance products, and with reasonable rate guidelines in place and mandated by the legislature.

Thank you.

Dear Ms. DeFeo,

 

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding homeowner’s insurance.  Governor Bush appreciates your views and asked me to respond on his behalf. 

 

As a result of the past hurricane seasons, property insurance rates have increased.  The Governor knows this is a challenging reality for homeowners, businesses, and local governments, but understands increased rates are a common market reaction to the risk associated with insuring homes and businesses in Florida at a time when so much damage was caused by recent hurricanes.  

 

Governor Bush believes the underlying problems in the property insurance market can be resolved by encouraging mitigation of homes and buildings to make them more resistant to wind damage, and by encouraging private insurance companies to underwrite more of the state’s wind risk.  This would minimize the number of policies and the amount of claims exposure for Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens), the state’s insurer of last resort.  Citizens covers those who cannot obtain property insurance from the private market.     

 

On May 16, 2006, Governor Bush signed Senate Bill 1980 into law.  This bill provides policy reforms and funding to stabilize and improve the property insurance market.  Senate Bill 1980 assists private insurance companies with an Insurance Capital Build-up Incentive Program allowing private insurance companies to underwrite more policies in Florida.  The bill provides funding for free home inspections and grants for homeowners who choose to reinforce their homes against wind damage through the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program.  It also provides funding to offset the deficit of Citizens, reducing assessments to homeowners, and provides reforms to prevent future Citizens’ assessments.  Those with internet access can view the complete text of the bill online by typing in the bill number on the Senate’s homepage at www.flsenate.gov.

 

Governor Bush believes that long-term reforms are necessary to repair the underlying problems that exist in the insurance market.  The Governor created the “Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee” to address these important issues.  This Executive Order is online at: www.flgov.com/executive_orders.

 

Thank you again for writing.  Governor Bush wants to know how Floridians feel about the many critical issues we face and encourages you to share your views with your local legislative delegation.  Please be assured that the Governor will keep your ideas in mind as he forms policy for addressing these concerns.  

 

 

Sincerely,

 

 

 

L. Wright

Subject: Home owners insurance in Pasco county

I am one of many homeowners that currently can not afford to own a home in the state of FL.  Just 1 year ago I was paying 700.00 year for my homeowners and was cancelled out of the blue. (Never had a claim)  I was forced to get insurance through Citizens because insurance companies were not underwriting policies in my area.  The cost increased to 2500.00, now I get another notice that it is increasing to 3507.00.   I was informed that the cancellation and increase is due to the fact that I live in Pasco County. Although my residence is in Pasco County I live 25 miles from the ocean.  With this new increase I am going to be forced to sell my residence and possible leave the state.  My husband is 62 years old cancer patient and we are struggling with Medical expenses and now this to top things off.  I have a seven year old grandson that lives with us and we fully support financially but can not get health insurance on because he is not our child or adopted child.  

 

I am left to wonder if this state homeowners insurance is just another way for the state to get money because we the consumer are forced to pay these outrageous premiums (Supply and demand). Something needs to be done to control this situation. Our politicians need to step up to the plate and take control over this issue.

I had been in the insurance industry for 13+ years and I know they are not losing money, they make a profit.

 

I am tired of the abuse and our government just has 1 more reason to take money from us and give it to illegal immigrants or the Medicaid population.

 

It is pathetic want we have succumbed to!

HURRICANE INSURANCE CRISIS | FIRST IN A SERIES
State failures leave policyholders without a net 
 

By Kathy Bushouse
South Florida Sun-Sentinel

August 6, 2006


Florida's property insurance market is a mess, despite legislators' attempts to fix it for more than a decade.

The price of home and condominium insurance has soared to dizzying levels. Insurers have dumped longtime customers and slashed coverage for others. The state's home insurer of last resort now is the biggest property insurer in Florida.

More and more homeowners and businesses are forced to ponder whether they can afford the Sunshine State anymore.

Much of this is the Legislature's handiwork.

Fearing any action that would drive insurers out of the state, lawmakers have shown for years they won't stand up to the insurance companies.

This year, with great fanfare, legislators directed $715 million in tax money to help close the $1.7 billion deficit at state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp. All Florida homeowners still are on the hook for the remaining shortfall of almost $1 billion. Yet legislators allowed insurance companies to raise rates up to 10 percent without getting state approval and cleared the way for drastic price increases for many of Citizens' customers.

"The casualty is the consumer," said state Sen. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton. "The Legislature has made the continuing mistake, year in and year out, of giving almost everything the insurance companies want to them, with the view that `Hey, if we do this, it will make more (competition).'

"How many years does it take? It's over a decade where this thinking hasn't worked," said Klein, who is running for Congress.

Over the next 12 months in South Florida, many people will see their homeowner's insurance bills more than double.

Ruth Berge, a divorced mother of two in Jupiter, is working a third job to pay additional expenses, including insurance.

"If I can't make this work, I'll have to [move] ...,'' the second-generation Floridian said.

The insurance market quagmire started in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew slammed into southwestern Miami-Dade County. Insurers realized their rates weren't high enough to handle South Florida's storm risk, and they had too many home policies concentrated in certain areas.

In the aftermath, state insurance officials and legislators allowed insurers to raise rates and slash coverage because thehurricane caused $16 billion in losses -- that's $22 billion in today's dollars.

The promise from insurers then was simple: Allow much higher insurance prices and we'll be able to handle catastrophes down the road. The state complied, approving big rate increases.

"I consider that a total renege of what we were promised," said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America and a former Texas insurance commissioner. "The big rate increases we granted back in the mid-90s were supposed to bring stability at times like this ... I feel like they lied to us."

Florida insurers say claims from the eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 wiped out their surpluses, even though they collected higher home and condo premiums for more than a decade after Andrew.

"We paid out $35 billion. It's a hell of a lot more money than we took in those two years," said Sam Miller, executive vice president of the Florida Insurance Council, an industry trade group. "It seems to me that we're taking a hell of a loss. And we're still here."

`PATCHWORK SYSTEM'

State officials had planned for the next Andrew, not the possibility of multiple-storm seasons. Therefore, as the insurance crisis deepens, some say the trauma exceeds what the state faced more than a decade ago.

"It's on its way to being worse, in the sense that we already have created the institutions that we thought were necessary to handle a post-Andrew crisis and those institutions are failing us," said Scott Johnson, executive vice president of the Florida Association of Insurance Agents. "What makes this worse, in my opinion, is that we have our patchwork system in place, and it's leaking like a sieve."

Johnson lays the blame for the insurance market collapse squarely on the Legislature. "Through commission and omission, they are responsible for all of it.''

Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, said in May near the end of the legislative session "there's enough blame on everybody's hands, [Democrats] and [Republicans] ... to go around. I'm not willing to lay that blame on anyone's hands, but I would tell you I think we all have culpability and we need to move and basically try to find a fix."

Even with the insurance fixes lawmakers approved this year, the balance of insurance risk and financial return is out of whack in Florida, consumer advocates contend. "It used to be insurance companies took some risk that they'd lose money ... [Now] they don't even want to suffer a quarterly loss," Hunter said.

"Why should we give them money and profits if they're not willing to take risk? That's the thing they're supposed to do. ... They're supposed to bring stability and comfort in a time of crisis. Instead, they're terminating people and dumping them out in a market that's a mess."

The higher prices today have nothing to do with being averse to risk and insurers are not making up for past losses, Miller said.

Insurance companies see the much higher costs of building materials and reinsurance, the insurance for insurance companies to help cover catastrophic claims; those two things make up the majority of the increases insurers are seeking, he said.

But insurers have reduced their storm risk in Florida, by shifting more of the burden in recent years to policyholders. Consider:

Thousands of the state's homeowners, after paying premiums for years, are being dropped. Allstate Floridian Insurance Co. alone is shedding about 269,000 property policies statewide.

Premiums have risen more than 300 percent for the average homeowner since 1992 when Andrew upended the state's insurance market. Before Andrew, Floridians paid an average of $366 a year for homeowner's insurance, according to industry figures. Today, that statewide average is about $1,300 a year; those averages are much higher in South Florida -- nearly $2,800 in Broward County, $2,600 in Palm Beach County and $3,400 in Miami-Dade County.

Special hurricane deductibles mean homeowners shell out thousands of dollars before insurers will pay damage claims. Prior to 1996, the standard deductible was $500.

Formed as a stopgap measure, state-backed Citizens is now the state's largest property insurer despite a decade-long program to shed policies.

Private national insurers have created Florida-only subsidiaries, which keep the hurricane risk contained to the state rather than spread throughout the country. That forces the Florida-only companies to rely more heavily on the reinsurance market, and those rates are doubling in some cases. Those increases are being passed along to consumers.

AFTER ANDREW

Andrew hit Miami-Dade County in the early morning of Aug. 24, 1992, cutting a devastating swath through thousands of homes and businesses. Until Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast last year, Andrew -- first measured as a Category 5 storm when it hit South Florida but later downgraded to a Category 4 -- was the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.

The brutal storm left Florida's property insurance market in upheaval. In a special session in 1992, legislators gave a $500 million shot to the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, which pays claims for cash-strapped insurers. Andrew bankrupted at least 11 of them.

Just months after Andrew hit, legislators created a joint underwriting insurance association, the predecessor of Citizens, as a safety net for the thousands of Floridians who had insurance policies canceled or lost coverage because insurers went belly up.

In 1993, legislators limited the number of policies property insurers could shed in a year. Insurers could opt not to renew 5 percent of their policies in Florida and 10 percentin a given county. That only applied to homes with insurance policies issued before June 1, 1996. The moratorium was lifted in 2001, when state officials weren't concerned about mass policy cancellations because theinsurance market was relatively stable.

Now the state restricts property insurers' policy non-renewals and cancellations after a hurricane. And insurers are prohibited from dropping customers with storm-damaged homes until 60 days after home or condo repairs are finished.

Also in 1993, legislators created the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund to offer cheap reinsurance coverage to insurers to help pay claims after hurricanes. The money comes from premiums paid by insurers.

But insurers drained the $6 billion fund to pay 2004 and 2005 storm claims. Now the same homeowners facing escalating premiums must pay an extra charge averaging $10 a year for 10 years to replenish the insurers' catastrophe fund.

REINSURANCE SURGES

In the mid-1990s, large national insurers such as Allstate and State Farm spun off Florida companies to handle property insurance policies here. But the parent companies held onto the lucrative automobile and life insurance business in the state.

That shielded the companies from massive losses in the event of more hurricanes in Florida. Allstate earned $1.8 billion in 2005 despite losses from Hurricane Katrina, down from $3.2 billion a year earlier, according to the company's annual report. And State Farm made $3.24 billion, down 39 percent from $5.31 billion in net income in 2004, according to its annual report.

Last year, U.S. property insurers reported a record $43 billion profit, an 11.7 percent increase over the previous year and the highest net income since 1991, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit trade group. Insurers handled the big claims from 2005 storms because they relied on reinsurance companies. Reinsurers absorbed half of the $55 billion in Katrina losses. Those same reinsurers are sharply increasing their rates in Florida coastal areas, making it more expensive for insurance companies to sell policies. And so property insurers are passing along the higher costs in the form of higher premiums.

Stuart Bowers, an Oakland Park teacher, is so angry his insurance bill keeps increasing that he has contacted legislators and e-mailed friends to "band together'' to do something. "Am I working just to pay windstorm premiums? ... At some point, something's going to give.''

Some say a national catastrophe fund will remedy Florida's insurance crisis.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., last month unveiled bills that would determine how to establish a national disaster fund. And U.S. Reps. Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Brooksville, and Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale, last November introduced a similar measure.

"When the big one comes, whether it's Los Angeles or Miami or St. Louis, the federal government is going to be in the position of [paying for] an event," state Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty said. "The state can only do so much. ... At some point this is beyond the ability and scope of the state of Florida to manage."

Dear Governor Bush, God only knows what the answer will be to this insurance crisis. I still havent been able to get insurance for my home. I was dropped by citizens because of a sinkhole claim. They of course said that I didnt have a sinkhole, according to their analyzers or the method they use. Surprise , I have a sinkhole 45 ft or more under my house. Thank goodness for my lawyer. As for the Everglades do everything that you can to stop the development on this natural beauty. Have you ever been there? It use to be incredible. By the way in an earlier letter I wrote I may turn Democrat, but I just cant do that HA HA...Keep up the good work.....

STATE REINSURANCE POOL FOR FLORIDA BUSINESSES BEING ACTIVATED

On Tuesday, the Florida Cabinet and I voted unanimously to activate a state
reinsurance pool to support private property insurance for Florida
businesses.   The move is a response to the growing commercial insurance
challenge in the state.  We continue to aggressively seek measures to
provide insurance relief for residents and businesses.  The availability and
affordability of insurance is the biggest threat to our incredibly robust
and growing economy.  Getting insurance, especially at a price they can
afford, can make or break a small business today.  Small businesses need our
help.  Many businesses across Florida have lost their commercial property
insurance or can no longer afford the premiums to retain coverage.  The
challenges are the result of global reinsurers dramatically raising rates
and limiting the amount of coverage they are willing to write in Florida
following two unprecedented hurricane seasons. Insurance companies purchase
reinsurance to cover catastrophic losses in the wake of hurricanes.  For
more information on the Property and Casualty Insurance Reform Committee,
please visit www.myflorida.com.


ALL ABOARD PLAN TO BRING COMMUTER RAIL TO CENTRAL FLORIDA

On Wednesday, I announced a comprehensive plan to improve freight service
and bring commuter rail to Central Florida.  Under the agreement in
principle between the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and CSX
Transportation Inc. (CSXT), Florida will invest $491 million to improve
infrastructure and expand capacity on two existing rail lines, one of which
will be used to establish commuter rail service through a multi-county
stretch in the region.  Establishing commuter rail will ease congestion,
which will improve the quality of life of people both on and off the road.
Improving the existing railways will enhance the safety and mobility of both
goods and people, which will generate new economic opportunity for millions
of Floridians.  In partnership with CSXT, Florida will invest $318 million
to improve the infrastructure and expand capacity on existing train tracks.

GROUND BROKEN ON MASSIVE RESERVOIR TO RESTORE AMERICA'S EVERGLADES

On Wednesday, I also joined local, state and federal leaders to break ground
on one of the most expansive reservoirs in the world as part of the massive
effort to restore America's Everglades. When complete, the first component
of the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir will cover 25 square miles and
provide 190,000 acre-feet of water storage to better manage water released
from Lake Okeechobee and to improve the timing and quality of water
delivered to the famed River of Grass. The $400 million reservoir is the
flagship project of the State's Acceler8 initiative to complete eight
critical Everglades restoration projects ahead of schedule.  Florida is
keeping its promise to restore the River of Grass and protect this national
treasure.  By constructing this massive water storage system, we can better
control water releases, restore wildlife habitat and protect the state's
estuaries.  Engineers will move close to 18 million cubic yards of earth to
construct the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir on 16,700 acres of
former farmland. Along with capturing runoff from agricultural areas, the
reservoir will store freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee to reduce
harmful discharges to the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries. The
reservoir will also provide additional water to hydrate the Everglades,
increase flood protection and allow water managers to capture and direct
phosphorus-laden water to constructed wetlands for treatment.  For more
information on Acceler8, visit www.evergladesnow.org.

Dear Governor Bush:

Florida is loosing ground daily in our economy.  We are having people relocate out of our state due to the high costs of insurance for a homes and businesses.
We can not wait until next year to resolve this issue.  We need to have a special session called now so that we can address this problem and come up with solutions immediately.
If we don't address this problem now, it will be more costlier and harder to resolve next year.  Please consider the loss in revenue the state will realize from doc stamps on mortgages and on the deed transfer.  If sales are down, so will revenue in these areas and many others.  Can the state afford this loss of revenue?
If this continues, Real Estate which is a mainstay in our State will die, Realtors will be on WELFARE (I'm not kidding) and foreclosures will be so many, banks won't know what to do with them.
Please call a special session now to get working on this situation.  To delay is costly to everyone.
Please help us, we are drowning just as though we were on a boat that was capsized.

Subject:	Property Insurance

Dear Governor Bush:
 
    Please address the issue of rising property insurance costs.  We recently were "non-renewed" by Old Dominion Insurance Company - reason - "they pulled out of Florida".  
 
    For our policy year ending 9-17-2006 our premium was $961.00.  That is approximately $80.00 per month.  We just received a letter from our insurance agent, Charles Brent of Apollo Beach.  He states the best market price he can acquire for us is $3,577.00.  This is an increase near 300% bringing our monthly cost to over $300.00.  On a retiree's fixed income this is impossible to handle.   What should we do without to pay these exuberant amounts?
 
      The policy bases the premium on a dwelling coverage of $141,900 (replacement cost).  As you can see, we are not living in a mansion, not on the Gulf, not even in a flood zone.  This quote assumes a deductible of $1000 plus our 2% Hurricane deductible.  We can save a "bundle" by increasing the deductible to $2500 - reducing the premium to $3,085.  Goody.
 
    We live in a "senior community"; we pay taxes but don't use the schools (which are already over crowded).  If seniors stop moving to Florida (or move out) we will be replaced by families with children.  If every taxpayer in the state had children in schools the situation would be worse.  The numbers of seniors contributing to school taxes is beneficial.  However, how long can seniors continue to stay with the current insurance rates?  Not long.
 
    This is clearly a disaster.   It is unfortunate that our state was hit with the number of hurricanes in the past 3 years.  What about all the premiums paid since Andrew?  How many major storms have we been subjected to?  Insurance....we pay our premiums "in case" but as soon as the insurance companies are called upon to cover the damages our rates sky rocket.  It doesn't sound like insurance...it sounds like mismanagement.
 
    Something needs to be done.  Now.
 
Sincerely,

I have been told by my insurance carrier, they would not renew my home insurance if I did not obtain a new roof by the renewal date. This date is September 20 and is fast approaching. 
I was hoping I could upgrade my roof to be in line with the mysafeflorida program. I am being told the area where I live would not be in the demographic area for this program.
I am at a loss for what to do. It was my understanding this program was for ALL Floridians, not a demographic area.  My home owners insurance has been increased from $800 yearly to $3000.00. 
I have proudly supported you and your programs for the past eight years, and now I need you to return the favor. 
This program was supposed to have kicked off by August 1st, and still no answers. Governor, please, before you turn your office over to someone else, please help the working class people of this state.

Subject:	[*] Solution to High Insurance Premiums

Mr. Bush
 
I have two Major concerns about living in Florida, My family and I moved here 14 years ago. but now with property tax increases and Homeowners Insurance increase over the past few years. We are now looking at having to retire to another state. I worked for a Insurance Agent for a few years before I return to Work for a major corporation. I do understand the reason for High Insurance rates, I realize the Insurance Companies have to collect enough premium to pay out the losses which have and will continue to occur. But I have come up with a solution. which would benefit Florida and other coastal states as well as the remaining states. If each Insurance company was require by law to create a National  disaster recovery fund. and each homeowner had to pay for  example 25.00 a year into this fund. Then when National disaster occurs,  Hurricane, Twisters, Landslide.earthquakes, (flooding which is not cover by any homeowners policy) could be paid from this fund. with every state participating I would thing their would be enough money to cover all of these types of losses. By removing the cost of these types of losses. in the current structure of Homeowner policies this would have to lower premium. encourage other insurance companies which have left Florida to return.
 
I am also worried about gas prices I have heard of people having to sell items out of their house to buy gas to get back and forth to work. I know we have oil of the Florida coast which could be drilled, but I would like to see our efforts used to create Ethanol fuel. Wouldn't it be great if Florida was the first state to be totally non depended on Oil

Dear Governor Bush:

I am a registered Republican but if something is not done about our 
homeowner's insurance prices, taxes and the control of gas prices in this 
state, I will not vote Republican in November or ever again. And that also 
goes for the illegal alien allowances for people to live the good life 
without following the rules of entry. Our medical facilities are suffering 
tremendously not to mention the increase of crime.

I don't blame the insurance companies, gas companies or the people who 
enter this state illegally. I blame the system for allowing this to happen.

Crist nor Gallagher will get my vote in November. The sad part of this is 
that I cannot even sell my home and move out of Florida. I'm stuck along 
with the other hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape to more 
affordable and safer states.

Governor Bush,
    I am sure that you hear this everyday, how the home-owners in Florida are being killed and bankrupt by the rising prices of insurance premiums. I myself have never filed a hurricane claim. I consider my home pretty safe at this point. My rates are higher than I can possibly afford on my modest income of under $10,000 a year.
    I became a widow 4 years ago and I also take care of my daughter and her three children because the state can't get their father to pay child support, that is another story.
    I was born and raised in Miami, not of Latin descent. I have always loved Florida, but find that the state is hurting the people who love it by forces us out. How can you sleep at night knowing people are leaving your state because they can't make the payments on their insurance premiums. They are higher than my mortgage payments. Something is wrong with this picture. The insurance companies in this state own us. What happened to American freedom. Insurance companies are still making profits and we are suffering. I can't believe that all the time they collect premiums from so many people who do not file claims and we also pay, what happened to discounts based on the individual. I am going to loose my home, because of insurance and now I guess I can collect from all the wonderful agencies who give money away to people who are not even citizens. My family will be on the streets for what? So that the people in government can have nice places to live and afford all the luxuries, I think that you and all people in government are getting something for every policy that is written. I hope you enjoy your comforts of home, for  soon my comforts will be gone, like so many of us.

Governor Bush:  I recently heard on the radio you have received an overwhelming amount of e-mail regarding home insurance.  I moved to Florida with my family about a year ago.  Florida is a VERY difficult state to live in, our home insurance was initially with Citizens.  The insurance policy was sold or given to an insurance company who promptly (almost) doubled it.  We, of course, are not in a position to pay that kind of premium so we "shopped" around for better rates and found a company who while still high was not as high!  Yesterday, (probably in the face of the coming possible hurricane) the company sent us a letter cancelling our policy.  I had read after last years hurricanes the State had a surplus collected in sales tax.  This was apparently a result of purchases for storm repairs last summer.  This money should have gone into Citizens as a cushion and to help keep insurance affordable.  I hav e never turned in an insurance claim and look at it as a catastrophic type of insurance.  Yet, even with that mindset,I do not see that anything has been done about this problem and have not seen any plans or suggestions that will take care of this problem. Why?  At this point, we like many are considering moving out of the State of Florida.  The problem is so is everyone else, there's an exodus with no incoming!!  I consider my family middle, maybe even upper middle, if we can't afford to live here, I'm betting a majority of others can't either - what a mess.  I've always considered myself Republican and have voted as such.  I now see myself as an independent, Republicans are making way to many mistakes.

Subject:	[*] Insurance crisis

August 6, 2006

Jeb Bush, Governor
State of Florida
Tallahassee, FL

Dear Jeb:

First, I would like to say that, as a resident of Florida for
approximately 50 years, I am very proud of the job you have done as
Governor of Florida.  You have quietly gone about the business of
preparing Florida for disaster, implementing education reforms, and have
brought a practical nature and an honest and realistic approach to
problems facing the state.

The purpose of this letter is to offer a suggestion for the insurance
crisis that we are all experiencing throughout the state.  We all know
that there are two major exposures for insurance companies operating in
Florida - flood and wind.  Flood coverage is taken out of the equation
through the Federal Government and the NFIP.  That leaves wind.  If
Citizens' windstorm program were expanded, and extended possibly
throughout the state, insurance companies would be much more willing to
write policies.  My company manages property in various areas of
Florida, all waterfront locations.  Our properties in Monroe County and
Miami-Date County had no problem in obtaining property insurance, due to
the fact that both properties have their windstorm coverage through
Citizens' Windstorm program.  However, we also manage a property that
sits directly  on Tampa Bay in Hillsborough County, which is of course
not eligible for windstorm coverage through Citizens.  Our total
insurance premium last year (4/05-5/06) totaled approximately $204,000.
This year's total premium is almost $900,000!  The replacement cost of
the condominium is approximately $19,000,000, and there was a two-week
period within which we only had windstorm coverage for the first
$2,500,000 and the last $9,000,000 of value - nothing in the middle
layer between  $2,500,000 and $10,000,000.  Coverage was finally
obtained through Lloyd's of London, but the cost was an astounding
$594,000!  Although our Board of Directors prudently budgeted for an
increase in insurance cost in the 2006 budget, no one could have
envisioned this size of an increase.  A large special assessment was
required, causing financial hardships for our condominium owners.  They
are also quite concerned about resales of units, since the regular
assessments will now rise considerably.  We were told by our insurance
agent that the insurance company that insured the first $2,500,000 of
wind coverage stated that if the policy excluded wind, the total
premium, covering all $19,000,000, would have been in the $80,000 range.

There are very few days that go by that an article is not in the St.
Pete Times regarding insurance, particularly stories of woe regarding
Citizens' property insurance problems.  Very rarely do I read a negative
article about Citizens' Windstorm policies; actually, there is very
little written about Citizens' windstorm policies at all.  The
commercial/residential windstorm policies are relatively affordable.
The 3% hurricane deductible is reasonable.  The $1,000 deductible for
non-hurricane wind is extremely reasonable.  Citizens could easily
increase that deductible to $5,000 or so, and "weed out" many of the
smaller claims.  With expanded participation in the wind pool, Citizens
could phase out its property coverage (or at least greatly reduce the
number of property policies), and concentrate on policies covering only
windstorm.  I don't know if this approach is financially viable, but
even if the cost to the state increased somewhat, I am sure that
individual homeowners, and owners of condominiums and commercial
property would save money in the long run.  Insurance companies would
gladly write policies in Florida if they were able to exclude wind
damage  from their policies.  

I suppose it is naïve of me to think that this suggestion has not been
proposed previously.  However, one never knows.  I saw you on the news
one day recently, and you looked so frustrated about the insurance
crisis and I believe you said something to the effect of you'd be glad
to call the legislature into special session to address this, but unless
any viable solutions were presented, it would be a waste of time.
Rather than just sit back and complain about it, I felt it was my duty
as a citizen of Florida to at least offer a suggestion.

On a personal note, I hope you and your family are doing well.  My heart
ached for you and your family in reading about problems encountered by
your daughter Noelle.  I am a single mother of two daughters (now grown
- one is a teacher of mentally handicapped students in Hillsborough
County, and one is an R.N. at Bay Pines VA Hospital).  I know how
difficult it can be to raise children, and at least most of us have the
luxury of dealing with our family issues in private.  I hope your
daughter is doing well now.

Good luck to you in your future endeavors as your tenure of governor
comes to an end.  If you return to developing property, perhaps our
companies can do some business together sometime in the future.  My
company has managed condo-hotel properties for 25 years.  I should note
that although our owners are technically "absentee owners", most
maintain their permanent residences within Florida.

Thank you for your time.

I saw in an interview where you’d mentioned that you’d support another gas tax holiday if a someone asked you for it. I had made note of doing this when gas prices started to hit that mark where it was really starting to make an impact on my families budget. Well, its starting to make an impact, but not just because of the gas prices but the cost distribution across the spectrum of products needed to keep a household running on a basic level (food and utilities). What is this leading to? You said it and I’m asking:

 

Can you please enact the gas tax holiday again?

I was paying $170.00 per month and now it is $ 996.00. Why not call a special session and get this representatives moving to get something done.All I hear is talk talk talk. It is an urgent matter and the insurance companies needs to be regulated one way or another. They can not have carte blanche to do whatever they want to rates. The state needs to interfere in this matter somehow. Private insurance are not able to cope and either they go out of business or they put every small business out, and it looks like they will do whatever they can to survive by killing everyone else..

Subject:	RE:Cancellations of Homeowners Insurance

Cancellations of older mobile homeowners insurance is rapid in our state. The institution of a "Tax Free" savings account, set up for only this reason would help resolve this issue.
I have written to my representatives, but never get a reply on this move valuable issue to us in these circumstance. Our state program is not only very expensive, but I understand it is overwhelmed with costs and financial assistance, therefore making the deductibles ridiculous. (As dealing with any government plan always is.)
Please put this in the minds of our representatives.
With muck thanks and admiration and respect to you.

Subject:	[*] High cost of home owners insurance and Property Taxes

Dear Gov. Bush, 
 
What can be done about the high cost of home owners insurance and Property Taxes?  Everyone I know is moving to NC due to excessive increases in Palm Beach County.  It is getting to be unaffordable to live in Palm Beach County.  As a single mom, with 2 kids, I have had a $1,700+ increase in my insurance this year and $800 last year.  My property taxes are over $4,100 as well.  My mortgage payments went up over $400 per month to cover these expenses, but my paycheck did not.  With real estate at an all time low, it would take me more than 6 months to sell, which would not help, plus, I could not afford to buy again.  I heard that there were millions of dollars in excess property taxes in Palm Beach County last year.  Why isn't anyone investigating this and make them bring these expenses back to a more reasonable fee?
 
I appreciate you looking into these matters and thank you for your time and wonderful service.  You will be missed.

Sir, Insurance companies are profit driven and at times from those that have lost the most. I believe and most of the people I associate with, that a state or federal insurance be made available. The major cost is in managing such a department. It's no secret to the people that insurance company employees work much lick a pyramid scam, the "perks" from top to bottom would make the most crooked congressman blush. I applauded you for helping those that have been dropped by insurance companies without regard to their loyalty for remaining a long term relationship with the company. I am fortunate enough not to need any assistance but that can change at the companies whim. I understand that the state is not in the insurance business but it should be, just as gas and electric have set guidelines and procedures to raise prices, I realize we have an insurance commission-fired, they should be investigated for allowing these things to get this far. I would have a look to see you is lining their pockets, and prosecute, for the lives they have taken from. 

I make this plea, to all that may have the power and heart, to stop insurance companies raking in the money and running when it's time to pay up. Katrina destroyed a city that all new that one day it would be underwater. It's totally disgraceful to spend Billions, to place new levies to rebuild a city below sea level. That money, would be better served to fill in the filth and unfortunately a historic area but a new city can be built on top of the old and a memorial or museum erected. With the cost of rebuilding as it stands now, you may as well give each family a million dollars to have them move rather than build new low income housing.

Please, if the American people were to be polled throughout the country, we would all morn the lose of a part of our history but common sense would dictate that what is planned is ridiculous. I know, you are the governor of Florida but also the brother of the president. Please help speak for the people of the United States. Sincerely........Gil Rodriguez  

I only wish you could run for office again, many feel the same way. thank you.......

Governor Bush,
 
Please do something regarding homeowners insurance. We live in St. Petersburg and have 4 small children. We received our renewal and our premium is going up $2500 for a total cost of over $6000. We are at a point where we are considering moving from the state. All of our children were born in St. Petersburg and we love it here however we are finding it hard to handle paying such outrageous premiums compared to other states. Our taxes are over $9000 so before we even consider our mortgage payment we have an expense of over $15,000 a year to keep our home.

Dear Governor Bush:

We are insured thru Sunshine State Insurance Company (SSIC) policy #SSH 
0020004 01 28. I recieved a notice of cancellation from them earlier this 
year and the outcome of that letter was that they learned that I had filed 
a claim back in 2004. (I called 4 or 5 times during that year about the 
claim, but thought there were so many other people that needed alot more 
help than we did so I just let it go) They contacted an adjuster, he came 
out, looked at the pictures I had taken before and after the hurricanes. I 
recieved a coverage proposal ffrom Citizens for $2766.00. Then I recieved 
a notice from SSIC that they will provide coverage for one more year at 
double the price. I was paying $831.00 per year so now it was going to be 
$1685.00. A few weeks after that I recieved another notice from them in 
which they added on an "endorsement" charge of $1622.00 for a total of 
$3307.00. My dwelling liability was now $139,000 and my personal propery 
liability was $104,400. As a norm, personal liability is 50% of the 
dwelling liability, so I called them to have it lowered to that amount in 
which I was informed that I do not have that option if my house is insured 
for less than $500,000. Our house has less than 1100 sq ft under air and 
we have no where near $104,400 of personal property, so why do I have to 
pay for the the excess coverage? This is not right. They're charging us 
for $52,200 of property that I know we don't have. What can we do?

Importance:	High

Governor Bush, 
  I have an issue that I would like an answer to or at least a rational explanation.  'Homeowner Insurance' is the subject. If the recent trend in the homeowners insurance business continues we will have no or very little choice when it comes to insuring our homes. As a citizen of Florida, I think that it is wrong to allow large insurance companies that have had huge profits over the past 60 years or so, to decide not to cover homes in the state of Florida anymore and still be able to insure Auto' s etc. within this state.  I think that if they decide to not cover homes, then the state should not allow them to cover anything else in the state. Lets take Allstate for example, they have decided not to cover homes anymore in the state of Florida, but they are still writing policies for automobiles, life Ins. etc. Just because they might have not had as huge of  profit in 2004 as in the previous years, doesn't mean that they didn't make a profit. They want to dump all of their loyal customers, who have paid and paid for insurance year after year.  This is not right or fair business practices. They did show a profit in their 2004 end of year report, I don't understand how this can be legal, not to mention it just plainly is not the right thing to do, and didn't State Farm just request an 80% increase, and only got permission to raise their rates 53% or so. I don't know if you have to pay for homeowners insurance, but it isn't cheap, I think before long a person looking for a home to buy will heavily consider how much the insurance will be, and when they decide that they can afford the house but not the insurance, they will eventually leave the state of Florida.  And if you have to have a mortgage on that house, you have to have insurance on it. Before long people will not be able to afford to buy a house here. Then we will lose all of the citizens that want to make this state better, and will be left with only the ones that are satisfied to rent a home instead of owning it. Not that there is anything wrong with renting, you just don't get the same type of person as a renter as apposed to a homeowner,  who has a vested interest in the community, renters can move anytime and anyplace they want. 
 
I understand that you have been trying to bring up the education level and the prosperity level of all of the citizens of the State of Florida, But if the insurance rates continue to climb I am afraid that you will end up with a bunch of renters instead of vested homeowners, that are interested in their community &  state. 
 
 
Isn't it the American Dream to own your own home? Are you willing to tell the citizens of Florida that they can have the Dream, but they just cant insure it?
 
 
I am sure that you have other things on your mind, but I only ask you to let me know that you have at least heard what I am trying to say. 
 
Thanks for your time,

I see where you say you are activating a state reinsurance pool for small businesses.  Excuse me, but what about the rest of us - the Homeowners?
Don't we count?  Without us, the small businesses will not have anyone to do business with.  This is a true 'slap in the face'!  Without your help, Florida will very shortly become a 'ghost state' with run down homes that people have been forced out of because they could not afford the Homeowners Insurance premiums.  The news is always playing up what a great state this is to live in.  It USED to be - but NO MORE!  You think the homeless situation is bad now, just wait - unless you do something to help us NOW - it is going to get a lot worse.  PLEASE do something to help us before it's too late.

I am a condominium owner in Lake Villas, Maitland Ave, Altamonte Springs, Florida since 1982 and I am shocked that as your constituents who own condominiums you are not doing something about the increasing insurance rates for condominium owners. How could you have allowed our Commercial Property insurances to be raised five times more than our previous premiums. Also, you have allowed Citizens to demand that we pay the entire premium immediately in order to get coverage, an unheard of request for all companies. Without regard for condominium owners you did not allow us time to obtain the massive necessary funding.

As owners in a 71 unit condominium, we are now in the position of having to pay over $181,000 or $2,500 each just for a Citizens policy that fails to cover much that our previous policy covered. Releasing legislation allowing Citizens, a State Agency, to do this is unconscionable. 

The Citizens policy 3% deductible for hurricane damage leaves us basically uncovered for most such damage. For example, if a $1,000,000 building suffers $30,000 of roof damage, we will receive no help from the insurance we purchased. 

In fact we had to pay over $7,400 more to another insurance underwriter just to get a bit more of the basic coverage that we had under our previous policy.

Our association has paid for uninterrupted insurance coverage for over 33 years with minimal claims. Now we condominium owners are being singled out to pay for such a large percentage of the State of Florida's losses. This is DISGRACEFUL AND OUT RIGHT DISCRIMINATION. As many people would say outright PRICE GOUGING

As you are probably aware most condominium owners are single people, retired people or single parents that you are allowing to be discriminated against. Condominium owners are just like private home owners. I have read articles on private home owners being upset regarding a 40-50% increase in their insurance premiums, imagine how they would feel if they were us.

Consequence to your lack of action is:

Some of our owners on fixed incomes may loose their homes when faced with this enormous increase.

A rash of foreclosures occurring in Florida will create an economic impact to our state. The condominium idea used to be a lucrative one where all owners shared and enjoyed the benefits of the property will no longer exist. 

Condominium property vales drop dramatically and condominiums will have little or no resale value.

At this point, we feel that our legislature has abandoned and blindsided us, leaving us in the position of being without reasonable insurance to protect us from the impact of natural disasters. We are asking that you, as a leader that we elected step up to the plate and take whatever action is required to immediately rectify this discrimination. We voted for you , we believed in you, now do your job.

    I want to start by saying that I commend you for your hard work and everything you have accomplished 

for the great State of Florida.  Thank you.  My name is Diana and I am in the U.S. Navy serving my 

country overseas.  

  

    I want to enquire about the about the issue stated above, mentioned on your newsletter.  The reason 

for my inquiry is due to my dads line of work.  He is an insurance agent (primarily health and life insurance). 

He is the hardest working man I have ever known, but he has struggled much since he moved our 

entire family to Miami, Florida in 1983 from Costa Rica.  He has and continues to have various problems (much 

of which I am not too familiar with), to include major delays in payment of commission.  Some companies do 

not even consider that this is his only source of income. 

  

    My concern is how this new plan will affect his work.  Will it affect him positively or negatively?  Your concern and statement regarding how insurance is dramatically unaffordable is very true.  That being my dads work, sometimes he is unable to pay for his own and my familys insurance due to the unreasonable rates.  It is an outrage.  Do you have

any views on this? 

  

Thank you for your concern in advance.

Dear Jeb,
I think you are one of the best Governors this state ever had. How ever I must comment that the $491 million  is a complete waste of money. That money should go to help relieve us homeowner of the financial burden imposed by Citizens Insurance. What is happening is that Florida is going to suffer because the attrition rate of folks that moved here is increasing dramatically and it's not due to the heat.  We are leaving because we are ripped off. My God Jeb, I can't even have my teeth fixed and I'm serious when I say it. It looks like everything ground to a stop. Why not develop a plan where the cost of insurance is prorated among several insurers so that premiums for homeowners return to normal.
Then if claims are made it would be spread among several insurers instead of one such as Citizens. A plan like that may motivate them to return to Florida. It's so very sad that the people of this state are being screwed and a plan to develop transportation system we really don't need is planned. That's almost a half a billion bucks. I will guarantee you it will cost 4 times that amount. I don't see anyone in this state working on a solution. My solution is to move out of Florida and go to Alabama. That's if I could sell my house. Who would buy it after they see the costs!  Please do better things with that money.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
The following three numbers are a positive indicative of the fiasco that insurance has become in the state of Florida.
 
1) Last year the property insurance for my condominium association was $146,321.
 
2) The property insurance rate for the coming year is $726,728.
 
3) In the past five years our claims have totaled $12,759
 
I must admit that after over 50 years in the insurance business at all levels, I have never seen a situation that was obviously as fraught with incompetence and unfairness as the above three simple numbers clearly point out.  In addition, in 1998 the property insurance was $52,000 and the insurance industry was not "losing" money at that time. These simple facts are no doubt repeated throughout the state and will force many people to leave the state of Florida. 
 
Governor Bush, I urge you to look into this situation.  There are 258 unit owners in our association, most of whom are on fixed incomes, I am sure many others in this state need relief  from these exorbitant and undeserved expenses and we can only look to you.

Dear Governor Bush,

When I was young we were told that insurance levels the playing field on risk.  Spread the risk!  Those were good times!  

 

Now-a-days it’ a lot different, the insurance companies now “cherry pick” who they want to serve (those in good health, or at low risk to the insurance companies).  I believe that the insurance companies who want to cancel home owners insurance or wind storm insurance for commercial properties, they should of course be allowed to do that, but the State of Florida simply tells them that they must cancel any and all other insurance policies that their companies control including in other aligned companies (LLC’s), such as Allstate Floridian and Allstate auto, life, health, etc., doing business in the State Florida. 

 

I think if the State Florida does this, that it will certainly slow down the flow of companies leaving the State over single issue problems like hurricane protection.  I am making this recommendation to other State of Florida leaders as well as you.

                                                            Respectfully submitted,

I like the thought for some type of reform for helping business owners with the insurance needs, however, It is the residents that need the reform. Many are leaving, many more will leave. There will be no need for business in florida if the residents can not afford to live here. Those that can afford insurance on their homes will likely tighten their belts and small business will fade as a result.

Governor Jeb Bush:

In regards to our insurance crisis e-mail, we were put in a situation.  A good friend of ours just purchased a home just down the street on the canal and it is one year older than our home.  The same insurance company that said we were unique because our home was over 40 years old and we were located in Merritt Island.  He was able to purchase homeowners insurance for $1,700.00  for $320,000.00 coverage.  When we found out he purchased insurance we immediately called to see if we could get it.  We do not live on the canal and were only looking for $130,000.00 worth of coverage.  The explanation we received is that his home was a new purchase.  Are we being discriminated for owning/home equity on our home and being non-renewal with Poe?

Governor Jeb Bush:
 
I am writing to you to voice my opinion about the insurance crisis occurring in your district and statewide.  We have been notified by our insurance company (Southern Family Insurance) that we will not be renewed and should seek insurance elsewhere.  Our search has left us with very few options; see the reply to my wife below. 

 

Hi Tina-

 

Usually I have more companies to quote with, but you're in a unique situation. I don't (won't) quote with Citizens, so pretty much all there is for an HO-3 (the form that covers the most) is USF&G. Well, they just moved their boundaries, and they won't take pretty much anyone in 32952. The next option is going with an HO-8. That form has some exclusion, but at least you have some options other than Citizens.  I'll e-mail you the form showing the exclusions, and you can call me with any questions. This company is backed by the state, and is A-Rated with Demotech.

Our insurance premium last year rose to $1312 from $833 the previous year.  Now we are getting quotes around $4500.00 for less coverage.  This equates to $375 added to the monthly bills.  This seems outrageous to expect an increase like this and for less insurance coverage.  This added expense will force us to be uninsured or leave the area.  I know that we are not the only ones in this unreal situation.  It seems like we are being discriminated against because of the location and age of our house.  I do not know the exact numbers, but I believe that most of the homes in Merritt Island are the same age as ours.  Please let us know what our lawmakers are doing in response to this crisis.

Subject:	Removing School Millage from Property Tax

Hello. Beginning in 2007, the State of South Carolina is removing all school taxes from property tax bills and raising the state sale tax to compensate.  This seems like a FINE idea as then all residents will be equally sharing school taxes, not just property owners. It's unfair that so many of our school children live in rentals but the parents make no contribution to their education.  And seniors have already paid for their children, let's not tax them again.
 
PLEASE consider this for our state.  We are in a real mess with the high cost of taxes and insurances.  Many people in this area are moving out of the state, they can't afford to live here any longer.
 
Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am a Realtor in Pasco County. Every day I hear hardship stories from people who can't afford their homeowner's insurance. They can't even afford to sell & buy something cheaper, because the loss of their "Save Our Homes" deduction would mean higher taxes, even in a less expensive property. Many of these people want to leave the state but no one will buy their houses. I see this reaching a crisis situation in the near future unless something is done to resolve these issues. Many of these houses will go into foreclosure. While I understand that real estate sales are down in most of the country, Florida's tax and insurance problems are her own & need to be addressed.

Governor Bush, 

I am very concerned about the insurance rates & gas prices in Florida.  I do not understand how the Insurance Companies were allowed the high rate increases.  They have made huge profits for years and years, let them use that for future hurricanes.  As a middle class worker and for all middle class and poor families this is going to cause a great burden on us.  Many folks are going to have to move out of Florida, and we are going to have many people losing their homes and being homeless, which we do nothing to help our homeless families as is.  I don't understand what our insurance commissioner was doing in allowing all this to occur, he certainly did not look out for Florida residents.  I hope at next election time the voters remember all that has occurred and vote them all out.  We need people in office that care about the working families, not the wealthy.  We need to do away with the lobbyist controlling how things go in this state. As for cutting back on fuel consumption, how are people suppose to get to work?  I do not know how the under $10.00 an hour person is paying for fuel, obviously they cut back on food or medicine.  We do not have any commuter service available.  Something needs to be done real soon to help folks or Florida will be the big loser in all this.

Dear Mr. Bush
 
   My name is Melissa Kirner. I am a 36 year old mother of 2 small children.I have lived in florida my entire life and now I have to leave my state of birth because I can no longer afford to live here.My electric bill has soared to 425.00 monthly because of fuel charges.Gas for my vehicle costs 70.00 a week. I pay 1550.00 a month for rent because of the cost of taxes and insurance. And my landlord has just informed me that he will not be renewing my lease in September because he can no longer afford to be a landlord. With the tax hike his monthly insurance premium will rise 300 dollars a month. Now I am forced to leave the place I have lived my entire life for a state where it is cheaper to live. I do not feel that this is fair to me, my husband, or my children.I do not feel it is fair for insurance companies to become rich off people who are already barely getting by. Oil companies have had the highest profits this year than in many years. If the cost of oil is going up then they should share the costs with their consumers. Florida has a lot of people that cannot afford to survive in this economy. There are young struggling families who barely get by let alone buy school supplies or clothes. These children are our future.The eldrely are forced to choose perscriptions or food. Now what happens to them. They are on fixed incomes and cant pay the bills they already have. I cant even save enough money to buy a home let alone make a 3000.00 monthly payment. Florida is in big trouble. We are loosing teachers, policemen, firemen,doctors,and all the little guys who fix cars and other mechanical things.What will happen when they are gone. It is bad enough to not be able to afford your own home, but now insurance is forcing affordable rental housing to become extinct. People are moving away. This is not good. Please help. Not only for me but all the other little middleclass people who are being squeezed out of our homes and the state we love.

 I really don't believe this will make it to your eyes but its all I have. I am a fifty year old male that until last January made about thirty two grand a year. I had a work accident and through worker's comp got raked over the coals. In older to pay outstanding bills I was in a nutshell pushed into a corner by the comp people. I settled and that's that. I have worked had all my life as you have and now I am being forced to leave Florida soon cause I can not afford to live here.

My policy is close to five thousand dollars and I have very little options. I have one of the people that make up the backbone of the working class for the state of Florida. You may not know it but there is a mass exit of people of my caliber that its scary. As for myself I am being priced out from living in Florida. I know you know the American dream......

Subject:	[*] VPK Funding

Please read the following letter and respond as soon as you have the opportunity.  Florida Educational leaders should be aware of the situation that the VPK program has created for our private school and likely others.  Thank-you.  Wendy VIles
 
Dear Lt. Governor,
 
My name is Wendy Viles and I am the founder and director of Hand in Hand Academy, located in Lutz, Florida.  I had the pleasure of meeting with you last summer at the VPK contract signing in Hillsborough County.  I was excited about the program and fully believed it to be an incredible opportunity for Florida's children and their families.  
 
It is with mixed emotions that I write this email.  As I waited on hold to speak to a representative, I listened to a recording of you explaining how quickly the State's VPK program has grown and how positively we are impacting the children enrolled.  I certainly agree and truly believe that the opportunities that 'we' are creating for children within our program are dynamic.  
 
All of our teachers at Hand in Hand Academy are certified and 38% of our classroom teachers have advanced degrees in education.  We elected to participate in the summer VPK program, and as the VPK provider contract dictates we fully expected prepay for the months that we participated.  Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is that this program has been financially devastating.  We have not only yet to receive any timely "prepays", but we are also still owed $45,000 for the July prepay and the August prepay (for school year) was due to us last week.  
 
We are a small program and do not have a substantial savings to fall back on.  The majority of our tuition covers teacher salaries and operational expenses.  Any spare money in the budget goes directly to new curriculum, supplies and equipment.  We are proud that we have never had a teacher leave and only lose students when our families need to relocate.
 
I point out these things because we are incredibly pleased with our programs and student progress.  We have individualized goals for each student and we employ reading teachers who read with each child individually as well as in small groups.  Our students are reading at astounding levels at very early ages.  We also have teachers for Spanish, music, art and physical education.  
 
Because of the VPK shortfall, I have been forced to borrow money from my own personal savings.  I did so with the thought that we would receive the funding in a few short weeks.  When I depleted my savings, I turned to a lender for a loan to continue to pay the summer VPK teachers.  At one point this summer, Hillsborough County was in debt to Hand in Hand Academy approximately $75,000.  My loan, which is with a private lender, was at a 15% interest rate.  Not perfect terms, but I needed immediate funds and this was unfortunately the best option I could find for such short notice.
 
I was suppose to close on my newly awaited home on Friday, August 4th.  This has been delayed because I do no have the monies that I need available for closing.  I am devastated that I am in this situation and truly concerned that I am going to lose my new home along with a $10,000 deposit that I have in escrow.  
 
Many local providers did not participate in the VPK program because of various concerns that they had about being involved in a new and unproven program.  Our program has been operating at capacity for years with a substantial waitlist.  We chose to participate to help our families realize the most optimal educational opportunities for their child/children.  I want to continue to be involved and hope to continue to support the VPK program, but as you can imagine I am approaching levels of frustration which will ultimately force our withdrawal as a VPK provider.
 
I spoke with Maxine McConnell several times today.  She was quite responsive and assured me that Hillsborough County received the July "prepay" on July 31st.  I then spoke to Hillsborough County and was told that, yes, they did receive money which may have been intended for July- but, because the State still owed such significant amounts that they needed to apply that money to back debt.  I, in turn, left a message for Ms. McConnell with my new found frustration that it appeared that there may still not be any payments in the immediate future.  She responded later in the day that she had requested Hillsborough County to respond to me directly.  It turns out that Hillsborough County "thought" that the State owed them more money than they apparently did.
 
Sounds like a game of bad telephone, only on a much more complicated and damaging level. I am requesting payment that should have been made on June 29, 2006 in the amount of approximately $45,000.  I am hopeful that August prepayment will be just around the corner.  We are not contractually "allowed" to ask parents for tuition if their child is enrolled in a program that offers only 540 hours.  Facilities that are paying $7.00 to $10.00 an hour will most certainly still realize profit margins.  Our program employs teachers at an approximate salary breakdown of $25.00 to $30.00 an hour.  I ultimately lose money on children who are enrolled in a 540 hour program.  At the very least, I should be able to expect prepay.  Even worse, nobody bothered to contact us about possible delays.  The money just never came.  
 
I apologize for rambling on during this email.  I do not know where to turn and am not sure how to survive the situation I have been placed in.  If you find yourself in Hillsborough County, I would love the opportunity to share our programs with you.  We are incredibly proud of what we are offering our students and families. Please let me know if you can be of assistance with our payment situation.  I look forward to your response.

Mr. Bush -
 
I recently have contacted Charlie Crist regarding several issues I feel are very important with the state of Florida. I hope that, if elected, he will continue the great job you've done as governor. However, I feel very strongly that Florida has come to a cross-roads for many residents and business here. If our government officials don't do something soon, our state economy and standards of living will become increasingly difficult and restrict the amount of progress we can make as individuals and a community. 
 
The first problem we have is affordable health insurance which covers more than 85% of hospital bills and has low copays and prescription medicines. As a small business owner, it costs me $5400 per year to insure a female with no preexisting conditions that is around the age of 25 years. This does not include vision or dental either. I cannot retain employees because they cannot survive without health insurance. Even as a business owner myself, I do not have dental or vision coverage because there are no programs that offfer real discounts that make it worthwhile to join!
 
Next, on a more personal level, my home owners insurance was increased by 60% this year! This has made a huge impact on the mortage I pay each month and I am required to have insurance on my home by my lenders. Of course I need insurance and in our state, with the threat of hurricanes and floods, I would not be able to afford repairing my home in the event that significat damage is done. When I tried to switch companies, only 1 out of 5 offered me a quote and wanted to charge me a $6000 hurricane deductible! 
 
With the increased price of fuel, heavy traffic, high insurance rates, and lack of health insurance for many individuals, I feel that we are doing an injustice to the citizens of the state of Florida. This state has always been a very inexpensive place to live and operate a business. It is why I stayed 12 years ago after graduating from the University of Central Florida. I have realized many dreams here and hope to offer oppotunity to others through my work and friendships. However, I see very difficult times ahead as we grow older and am deeply concerned about Florida's future. Perhaps you have some answers or solutions to these problems. I would be happy to help where I can. Please let me know.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I wanted to know if you have read the NY Times #1 Bestselling "FairTax 
Book" yet?  It is coauthored by talk show host Neal Boortz and Republican 
Congressman John Linder who introduced the Fair Tax Act of 2005 (H.R.25).

If you have not yet read the book than please do read it.  I notice that 
the FairTax scorecard lists you as being AGAINST the FairTax: 
http://fairtaxscorecard.com/Replookup.phtml?CongLeadID=2970

I am led to believe that you have not yet read the book.  I could not 
imagine you would be against a proposal that would eliminate the 66,000 
page Income Tax code, and the IRS, and replace it with a simple and Fair 
National Retail Sales Tax.  This would have a tremendous effect on the 
economy and would also help the states.  

Looking forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Dear Lt. Governor Jennings:

If anyone today is not aware of the real problem with home insurance in today's market they are probably living in a cave.  If they are aware of it and are ignoring it they obviously do not care or they are "friends" with the insurance companies.  As our elected official you need to care and you need to act upon it immediately.

The insurance industry announced earlier this year that the industry as a whole experienced a profit in the 1st quarter of 2006 of over 7$billion. That does not sit well with the citizens of Florida being discarded like yesterday's old newspaper and being robbed with triple and quadruple home insurance premiums.

We all understand that the insurance companies are trying to run a business and cannot afford to lose money.  But, I feel that our insurance commissioners, both past and present have allowed the ins. cos. to run rampant during the last decade with increasing premiums and cancelling policies at will with no one controlling it, they now feel that they can do anything they want. IT MUST STOP NOW!.

Whenever I hear a politician comment on putting controls on insurance companies they all say "well , if we try to control the premiums the ins. companies will leave the state". I say that is bunk. They are not about to leave possibly trillions of dollars in premiums just because some controls have been put on them. THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT LOSING THE INS. COS.

1. Mandate that ALL insurance companies offer ALL LINES of ins. If not, then they can not sell in Florida. This will spread out the risk and provide competition in the market--and, believe it or not, they all will still make money.

2. The Federal Govt. and the State Govt. need to assign funds to assist citizens when there is a disaster. For example, if a disaster strikes then the govts. step in after pre-determined loss limits have been met by the ins. cos.  Our federal govt. thinks nothing of going to Indonesia and giving them billions because they had a disaster.  And, they told us to leave, "just leave your money".  Our money should first be for our citizens and if there is any left over then maybe we can help someone else, but someone who appreciates it. This funding should be legislated as a "savings account" for any disasters within the 50 United States and not a spur of the moment decision as it is now.

I am sure that there are probably other things that can be done to halt this ins. problem. However, I leave you with my suggestions since you have the resources to come up with other ways of stemming the problem.

Incidentally, I have not heard from any politician (except Mike Fasano) come up with any thoughts as to how to solve this problem.  Mike, I went to one of your speeches and was glad to hear that you are trying to get this problem solved.

NOW, this problem will not wait until the next legislative session--it will only get worse.  YOU NEED TO CALL AN EMERGENCY SESSION NOW.  REMEMBER, THE FUTURE OF FLORIDA AND THE FLORIDA ECOMONY DEPENDS ON IT AND. REMEMBER ALSO THAT WE WILL BE VOTING IN NOVEMBER.

Subject:	[*] spinal muscular atrophy

1 in 40 – SMA Could Affect You 

Dear Sir  

The statistic is: 1 in 40 people carry the gene that causes SMA – Spinal Muscular Atrophy. That means that more than 7 million Americans are carriers of disease that most people have never heard about. 

I learned about SMA last July when my eight-month-old daughter, Vivianna, was diagnosed.  I felt something was wrong; she lost a few abilities  most children that age have.  Her pediatrician agreed and an appointment was made with a neurologist.  He suspected SMA immediately and 9 days later called with the results of her DNA test.  I was told over the phone that my beautiful daughter would die before her second birthday and I should decide how I wanted to handle the end of her life.  Imagine a doctor telling you this over the phone while you are watching your child sitting on the floor eating a cracker.  My world came to an end that day.  I knew in my heart that he was wrong in stating which type of SMA she has.  His exam lasted ten minutes.  Thankfully, she was examined by other doctors who immediately stated that my daughter did not have the severest form of SMA and explained why.  At least now we have hope.

Parents of SMA children learn all too soon that doctors are quick to write off these children.  Egos come into play, many doctors I’ve encountered are unwilling to learn of the advancement other doctors who study and treat SMA children have made.  

Here are a few quick facts. SMA is the leading genetic killer of children under the age of two. SMA is a degenerative disease that affects the voluntary muscles. Those that survive face a life watching as their muscles slowly fail leaving them unable to walk, crawl, sit-up or even swallow. It is a recessive disease – two parents who are both carriers of the gene that causes SMA have a one in four chance of passing the disease on to a child. SMA crosses all racial, ethnic, religious and gender boundaries and while it is primarily diagnosed in children it can affect people of any age. August is SMA awareness month and there is hope. 

Families of SMA, a grassroots organization of which I am a member, is funding drug development programs and clinical trials which may mean a treatment is on the horizon. The federal government is considering the addition of SMA as one of the recommended diseases for newborn screening. You are reading this article so that one more person knows about SMA. Awareness is the beginning. 

Sometimes it takes celebrities to bring a disease from the shadows out into the light. Sometimes it just takes the dedication of individuals to make a difference. 

To learn more about how you can help contact Families of SMA at 800-886-1762 or on the web www.curesma.org. We are working to help raise awareness and funding for research, education, advocacy and patient services. By increasing funding, we can help to unravel the mysteries of this disease and continue working toward effective treatments. By participating and donating, you can make a difference in a life. Together we will find a cure! 

One in 40 may seem like a big number, but it became very small when it touched our family.  

Our children our suffering because of very little State and Federal Funding applied directly to a genetic disease that is the number one killer of children.  Our President has decided that Stem Cell research is immoral.  The eight cell blastocysts  in stem cells are not human beings.  Stem Cell research is not murder, stem cell research saves lives.

Our children also suffer every time an insurance company denies a claim for treatment or equipment.  I hope you never have to watch your child struggle to breath, and I hope you never have to insert a 16 inch catheter into your child’s lungs to suction out the teaspoon of water he or she is choking on.  SMA children cannot cough or sneeze due to weak muscles.  The next time you have a cold or have swallowed incorrectly, imagine not being able to cough.  

Many States, especially Florida offer such little help to parents.  Medicaid is non-existent for children with SMA 2.  

Our children need help; they need funding for research and coverage for health care needs.  Who will be the first Senator, Congressman to say the words Spinal Muscular Atrophy?

My last question is this:

Does my daughter have to be Iraqi to receive proper medical care in this Country?

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I am writing in reference to a big problem my community is going though. I live in Miami, FL in the Allapattah neighborhood. I've been part of a Neighborhood center which is run by Children's Home Society for the past 7 years. They have not only helped me and my family, but many other families in my situation thoughout all these years, and has been an essential part of my life. I started there volunteering, seeking a place of refuge. In my neighborhood, there has been a history of drugs, and violence, and to avoid getting into problems, I went to that center to keep myself busy and safe. Since I was 16, I have interacted with hundreds of teens my age and my financial status, and we have grown so fast, with the help of CHS. We are a poor community, and  I can not imagine not being part of this center, because I still have a smaller 12 year old brother who needs help and support. I was informed not so far ago that Children's Home Society "did not have enough funds" to pay for the rent for that center, therefore the last day for them to work there is 8/31/06! That's less than a month! I am scared for all those children and teenagers who don't have any where to go, and might end up in the streets, either getting into trouble or creating it. They have an OUTSTANDING tutoring program, and they have lots of activities that involves teens helping children. I have experienced so many wonderful things including my Senior Prom. Without this program most of the seniors in the center wouldn't have gone to their prom, due to the lack of money. 
Please help us out getting this program back and running in a location that is accessible to all the people in need, the current cases, and future ones that will come. This is the only place where hundreds of people feel safe, secure and appreciated. Most of these people don't have family here, and this center has made them part of a family. For Thanksgiving, they give out meals, because most can't afford them. For back to school, they give out school supplies, because they know that all of us don't have enough income, and for Chistmas, they do a Toy Drive. It's incredible the amount of help they have provided and it would be sad for such a program to be terminated. 
I'm attaching a pdf file, with the information for this program. Please, I beg you help save this essential part of our community. The contact number for the person in charge is Mirta Fuentes at (786)797-0969 and they're located on 1901 NW 36 ST Miami, FL 33142.
 
Sincerely and from the bottom of my heart,

Adam,

 

Enjoyed chatting with you at the Yacht Club last Wednesday and so appreciate your concern and interest in the Wind Coverage for not only our club, but for the many other businesses in Charlotte County that are facing the same problems.  I so appreciated having an opportunity to briefly discuss the Wind Pool Situation for Charlotte County with you.  Timing is everything!

 

To update you on our situation, we have had 2 quotes on wind coverage. After incurring a $3.5 million-hurricane loss, the club needs to become more creative in solving its insurance problems.  The FCYC is working on a Wind Pool for member clubs, and it is my hope that Charlotte County is continuing  to work on admittance to the Florida Wind Pool, neither of which may be available for the upcoming hurricane season.

 

Our insurance broker has been trying to secure wind coverage for many months and found only one option available to us. This option is through Lexington Insurance Company, Greensboro, NC. The premium for $2,500,000 in coverage is $435,375 plus interest with a $300,040 deductible.  Gary Sullivan, a member of our Insurance Committee also obtained a quote through Brown and Brown Agency. Wind coverage for the building for a 3.6M limit and contents limit of .5M at Berkshire-Hathaway for $205,000 with a $300K deductible.  Needless to say both of  these quotes are astronomical and unacceptable.

 

Frank Hokenson, a Yacht Club member and the Insurance Chairman for the Punta Gorda Boat Club, has also had no success with coverage, nor has the Punta Gorda Isles Civic Association, St. Vincent de Paul, and Isles Yacht Club just to name a few.  

 

Frank has been instrumental in talking with Robert Hebert , Assistant to the County Manager.  I have also spoken with Mr. Hebert, as well as Wayne Sallade, Director of Emergency Management.  I was shocked that Charlotte County had done nothing following Hurricane Charley to get the total County in the Florida Wind Pool.  The barrier islands of Charlotte County are in the pool, so why with so many businesses trying to come back from the devastation do we have to be further delayed by the inability to get wind coverage?  I would hope that you and the rest of the County Commissioners would put this grave matter at the top of your list.  While legislation to put our county in the Wind Pool cannot be done until next year, it is my understanding that the Cabinet could act on an Emergency Basis and put all of Charlotte County in the State Wind Pool.  I prevail upon you to find a way to get the Cabinet and the Governor to consider an Emergency Meeting.

 

Charlotte Harbor Yacht Club has worked diligently since August 13, 2004 to bring our club back and to become a viable part of this county, I am sure we are one of many.  To now be forced to face a situation of unaffordable Wind Coverage is a very sad thing for this community.  In speaking with Wayne Sallade, he suggested that we email the Governor and the Cabinet and appeal to them to take immediate action, if we are hit with another hurricane and we have no wind coverage how can we “come back again”?  Please be proactive in getting the Cabinet to take Emergency Action for Charlotte County.

 

I thank you again for your concern and would appreciate any input or suggestions you might have to offer.  I can be reached at this email address or my phone number is 575-6788. 

 

Sincerely,

Chari S. Leitch

Subject: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE

 

A serious situation is taking place in Charlotte County, regarding property insurance for commercial buildings, and their contents.

 

The Punta Gorda Boat Club’s property insurance renewal, May 31, 200 6, was conditional, excluding wind coverage.  Following the notice of no wind coverage, a thorough search was conducted to obtain such coverage, through several insurance agencies, to no avail, and in fact were advised Charlotte County, other than the barrier islands, is not included in the Florida State Wind Pool.

 

We have also learned that we are not alone in not being able to purchase wind coverage, as the local insurance agencies contacted have stated generally commercial insurance policies in this area, particularly, within three miles of tidal water, are being renewed excluding wind.  A  recent newsletter from RE/ Max Harbor Realty, stated “ Commercial real estate insurance is not available at all”.  It is my understanding, Charlotte Harbor Yacht Club, St. Vincent de Paul, Punta Gorda Civic Association,  are experiencing the same problem.

 

Wind and Flood are our main hazard concerns.  We are able to purchase flood insurance through the Federal Flood Pool, leaving us without insurance for the very possible hurricane potential, as we have recently experienced in 2004.

 

 The seriousness of this situation, can be easily visualized, should a hurricane, such as Charley, again cross this area. The reality would be, very limited rebuilding of commercial buildings, debris clean up would be minimal, and many businesses would be permanently out of business, without necessary funds to continue.  

 

I have been in contact with Mr. Robert Hebert, County Administration, who advised, the State Legislature established the Wind Insurance Pool for specified Counties, several years ago, and it would take a Legislative act to include Charlotte County.  However, a temporary inclusion could be effected immediately by the Governor’s Cabinet, allowing Charlotte County commercial interests to purchase wind insurance coverage from the pool, as they can in many of the State’s Counties.

 

It is requested Charlotte County make application to the Governor’s Cabinet for immediate inclusion to the Florida Insurance Wind Pool.

 

Very truly yours,

To Whom It May Concern:

I'm working on an article about the recent legislation repealing the intangible tax.  I have a few questions for Gov. Bush in regards to the legislation and the tax.

1) Why did he want to repeal it?
2) How beneficial will it be to residents who do not have to pay it any longer?
3) What have the revenues gained from the tax gone towards in the past?
4) How will the Florida government make up for the lost revenue?

My deadline is Friday.  Please respond asap.

Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida
RE: Ludicrous Taxes For Americans, But Especially Floridians
Dear Governor Bush,
I know that you have been getting a lot of complaints about the increase
in taxes for the 2005 year.  However, our particular case really
illustrates the disregard for citizens of this state. Our tax increase
was $1,720.11 from $3619.95 for the year 2004 to $5340.06 for 2005. The
amazing thing is that there was no structure on this property for that
tax period. We didn't take occupancy of our new house until July 18,
2005. Another point is that this is a single story dwelling with a floor
plan of 673 square feet. Our neighbor to the East has a two story house
with 1,444 square feet, more than double that of ours. Their tax was
$3597.02 for 2005. I know that they have homestead exemption, plus other
exemptions totaling $40,000, but they had a two story livable house as
opposed to our vacant lot. The cost of a Cadillac Elderado is certainly
more than a Volkswagon Bug. Therefore, can you explain the high taxes on
our property to me? 
We were working in Miami when we bought this property in 1976. It was
like a get-a-way from the big city and something to work toward for
retirement. We moved to North Florida, but I became disabled and needed
to be in a warmer climate for the winter, for the same reason many other
Americans that come down from the North. Our children and grandchildren
still live in the area and we use this place to stay and see them.
Most of the folks here were average working people. We both had an income
and could afford the credit union payments to buy the land, a small
trailer and keep up with the condo fees. The taxes increased as expected,
but we had a chance to improve our skills and also received raises in our
wages enabling us to be able to afford to pay the increase in taxes. I'm
a retired Florida teacher, so you know I'm not some big entrepreneur. Our
tax bill for St. Lucie County had gone up almost 48% this past year. Our
cost of living (COLA) increase from our retirement sources has gone up
about 3%, not nearly enough to pay the tax with ease. This last tax
increase of 2005 has financially strapped many folks living in this
community. I have heard of several widows that can not afford to pay the
increase in taxes and are unable to sell because the tax is so high.
What is to happen to them?
Something should be done to help us. I hope this letter doesn't fall on
deaf ears and that I receive a reply from you. Thank you very much,
Best regards,

Dear Governor Bush,

Now that HB 285 has passed the legislature, I urge you to sign it
into law. This bill would change state law to prohibit the
confiscation of firearms during a state of emergency, and would
outlaw police misbehavior such as the outrageous conduct in New
Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, which was soundly rebuked by the
courts.

Unlike some parts of the country, we in Florida value the right to

Working for a county commissioner is as eye-opening as working for a state legislator.  As we wind down with our budget workshops many people don't seem to mind stationery or slightly "above" property taxes, and as you know Brevardians love to tax themselves for endangered land etc.,  it's the insurance that's forcing them to lose their hair or have the gray covered more frequently.  I watched some of the cabinet meeting this morning re this subject....and the unfairness to both the citizens and businesses that has reached critical mass......the legislature didn't do it's job this year, and if the insurance companies continue to rattle their sabres and continue to cancel policies, people WILL leave, they'll have no choice .....They don't mind paying their fair share for insurance and even Citizens was a good start.....has anyone considered an increase in the sales tax (1-2%) tied directly to an insurance fund for those who can't get insurance?  At least everyone would pay for it.  People I know  and listen to consider themselves very lucky to live in a state with no income tax, no intangible tax, love the climate, prices etc.  but let's face it, there's no free lunch anywhere......we also need to get the homestead portability passed next year but LIMIT to only the county they reside in, not allow them to take the portability elsewhere....and oh, one more thing, I do hope that Charlie selects Toni as his running mate.....what an asset she's been to you and this state .....actually Charlie would be smart to select her NOW and get that word out....he'd be a shoe-in.  I've known Tom ever since I worked for Marilyn Evans-Jones (Rep from Melbourne) in the 70's-80's when I moved from D.C., but........
 
Thanks for letting one public servant blow off some steam to another!
 
Will miss your excellent leadership and bringing sanity to a state who had lost its battle with environmentalists and education needs......

Dear Governor Bush:

I moved here 1.5 years ago to start a name for myself in Real Estate so I could continue to earn a living and enjoy my golden years to the fullest.  I am currently looking for a salaried position at an age where discrimination to my age gets me at every turn.  10% of the houses in my nice development are for sale and when I ask why they are selling it is taxes and insurance.  When I ask where they are going I am told GA, the Carolinas and TN.  But they can't sell, they can't move, I can't make money, we are all scared silly.  My neighbors are being cancelled right and left.  I fear I will be when my insurance is up for renewal, and I cannot afford Citizens.  I know elderly people who are going uninsured because they cannot afford the cost, and they are luckier in a way they can choose
that-they have no mortgage.  I have to have insurance.  For too long insurance companies enjoyed big profits and now when they have had some dings to their bottom line they want to pull out.  This is not Disneyworld any longer, Tinker Bell has run out of pixie dust and we need a change.  In my company alone-and we are in almost every state, FL always led with the most sales, most new homes etc.  GA now beats us and this is not good.  It is time to help the American tax payer first-where are your priorities?  We will be watching for those priorities in campaigns and we will support and elect officials who are willing to put us first.

I am appalled and disappointed with the Insurance Commission and the Legislators of the State of Florida for allowing the citizens of Florida to be subjected to what amounts to highway robbery concerning insurance policies.  It is unacceptable that you would allow such an increase in premiums while providing less coverage!  

 

I am a 60-year-old widow, working to pay my expenses, not asking for assistance, and am faced with a premium that has increased from $1,109 to one quote for $3,525, with a $12,250 deductible and another for $7,300 with a $5,000 deductible!

 

Shame on all of you for not addressing this matter and for not fighting for legislature to protect the citizens of your state.

I cannot believe that I have not heard what you or the incoming candidates will be providing for the Florida homeowners.  I’m not concerned with where Crist or any of the other candidates receive their monies.  I would like to know the plan to get Florida out of the Homeowner Insurance mess!  I just heard yesterday about an employee who was paying $1800 and now received a bill for $5600 with USF&G, not even Citizens.  I am appalled at the lack of media coverage on this topic for this election.  What is the plan to fix this insurance mess?

 

For the taxes, I hope that we don’t lose the 3% cap.  Right now, this might be the only thing that could save a homeowner from becoming a renter.  

 

As you know, the Tampa Bay area has many older homes, which are actually historical.  We don’t want to have to condemn these houses to accommodate a crazy homeowner insurance business; I was told anything older than 1991 will be slammed with a huge insurance premium.

 

I sure hope that someone reads these emails and takes action soon.  The insurance industry is definitely out of control!

Dear Governor Bush: 

I understand that you said we don't need a special session to address the insurance crises? 

My wife and I have been living in Florida for almost 20 years. We moved to Ft. Pierce eight years ago.  Since that time, our taxes have gone up about $100.00 a year.  Our homeowner's insurance, on the other hand,  just a little over a year ago  was $1,100.00.  I had to increase the  insurance because of the increase in the  value of our home, so my insurance went to $2,300.00.   As you know, we were hit by hurricanes and our insurance company Poe Financial went under.   We are now in the pool with Citizens.  Our premium is paid until next March.  I checked with some other insurance companies:  State Farm, who said they will not insure a house older than five years, Metropolitan Life said since we had a claim, they cannot touch us for five years.   I did get one company to tell me what my new premium will be, he said over $6,000.00!!!  This is  ridiculous.  I am 74 years old and have been paying for  homeowner's insurance for 50 years with only one other claim. I will not be able to pay $6,000.00, that is half of my Social Security check!    If I drop the homeowner's insurance completely, I would have to pay off my mortgage which will mean I have to spend my savings, and if I did drop my homeowners and we have another hurricane or claim I will not be able to fix my home.  We will be just like the people in Louisiana, no place to live. 

This state has allowed the contractors to rip off the public which has caused larger than needed claims which of course comes back to us the policyholders in larger premiums. (Why are the water damage companies not regulated?)  We reported one such company and nothing was ever done.   It looks like our only recourse is to try and sell our house and move to a different state, but can we do that?  If new owners cannot get insurance,  it looks to me like we are between a rock and a  hard place .  It also looks to us  that you worry more about the illegal aliens benefits than you do about American citizens , time to start looking out for the people who pay their taxes and follow the laws of our country..

Being our future President I only hope you can get something thru with #43 so that Insurance Companies stop ripping us off, what is their problem, they're still making money and plenty of it.  I only hope you can do something about this problem here.  Our insurance rates have doubled which is very unfair.  How do they think these poor people can afford these high prices which are "sky high"!  Insofar as hurricane shutters are concerned, just ordered for our home and wonder if these are eligible for our Income Tax?  I would certainly hope so!  Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated by the people of Florida.  Thank you Gov. Bush.  M. Potts

Dear Governor Bush,
I am a very conservative Republican but I have a bone to pick with my party. As a small business owner My wife and I had to close our retail shop in Fort Walton due to the rising costs of Insurance/Rent and gas prices. Sir, You must know that the little guys are taking a beating due to these issues. The large corporations have every right to make an honest profit but we feel its gotten out of hand. Exxon Mobil making 10+billion in 3 months is completely out of control. The Insurance companies are doing the same thing here in the panhandle and throughout Florida. Your administration is letting them raise our rates to astronomical levels to recoup their costs and bail out Citizens. What do you think that is doing to the housing market here? How much profit is enough? These corporations are clearly taking advantage of a Republican administration, Senate and Congress. If there is no relief on gas and insurance very soon my family will vote Democrat in the next election and believe me I am not alone after talking to many Republicans about this. This makes us very nervous because we know the Dems will really mess up the war on terror but we must get these big Corps and fuel prices back under control.  The American people know what is happening in Washington and we will change it if the current government won't. Runaway spending, Higher interest rates, housing market dropping, Criminal corporate profits and corruption, and record energy costs. Sounds like a receipe for disaster for our party and our economy.  PLEASE HELP FIX IT BY CURBING THESE INSURANCE RATE HIKES. Look into how many businesses are closing due to the rent going up, business dropping off because people dont have spending money to buy gas. Our party cannot rely on the War on Terror only and we have made a mess out of the economy. WE ARE HEADING FOR DISASTER AND ANYONE WITH A BRAIN CAN SEE IT.. SMOKE AND MIRRORS DON"T HELP DEMS AND IT WONT HELP US EITHER.

Governor Bush,
 
As I working with several other people to rebuild and expand (we are all volunteers) the Desoto County,  Arcadia All-Florida Rodeo arena and facility. I would like to thank your office for making the $30,000 feasibility grant money possible. Thank You. 
   
Stop and Think!
If a Hurricane, Natural disaster, Terrorist attack happened is SW Florida........The most logical emergency command center and hub would be an Equestrian show facility's with Rail Road access, which is what we are building.......WHY ?????........these Equestrian show facilities have, as part of their normal components,  which become key elements needed in a disaster recovery situation. a) several hundred acres close to town: that could be used for staging-up equipment and housing manpower (in tents), b) Multiple bath room/ shower buildings scattered across the grounds: that could be used to keep quality of life and sanitary conditions for man power and evacuees, c) Exhibit Halls: which could be used to be used as office space, cafeteria, medical offices, dry supply storage. d) Horse stalls and Dog/ cat kennels: which could be used as pet shelter, animal control offices, military and police dog housing and emergency veterinarian care. e) Main Stadium 9,000 seats plus a large arena floor space, office space w/privet bath rooms and showers, sky boxes and conference rooms: This could be used as  housing, information briefings to evacuees, supplies, communication center and accommodations for key emergency manager personnel. f) RV park area's (300 water, sewer and electric hook ups: This will allow instant housing for key personal and their families with no set up time, pull the RV or Travel trailer up and plug in. g) The Rail Road spur and station: This could be used to connect SW Florida to the rest of the country,  with the most efficient method of mass transportation known. you could move supplies or people North or South, thousands at a time and per hour.  you could even evacuate people from south Florida,  hub them in Desoto county and then bring them to any place in the country.  Consider the possibilities     
 
Our concept 
is to build a several hundred acre equestrian and rodeo facility with mostly private funds. The facility would be owned and operated sole by the 80 year old "not for profit", organization, the "All- Florida Championship rodeo" currently run by President Judge, Don T Hall of Arcadia. The completion of this faculties will preserve the agriculture industry in our area by promoting agriculture events and allowing our Florida students to show animals, participate in agriculture functions. This facility would impacts the community with job, tourism, economic development during normal weather and when a storm threatened or hit, the facility would be turned over to the Desoto County emergency management team or FEMA.to use as they see fit..... This would be one of the only PET Friendly shelters in our area and even possibly regionally. Now add the idea of an EVACUATION TRAIN, this could be a great way to become part of a net work of shelters connected by the Rail Road. 
    The Icing on the cake is that we have interest from the world famous circus "Ringling brothers" circus who has a genuine interest in making Desoto County their winter Quarters. This will promote Florida tourism across the united states and will certainly significantly impact the economy of our town which is only 2 hours from Orlando's Disney world. 
 
 
This e-mail is to ask you to please appoint one or more staff members to our board of advisors for this project. We would like the governors office to be involved in the planning of our facility. we fee this facility will become a key resource for the state during disaster recovery, on a local and regional level ...As you know we will need the support experience of every one we can to make this project work. By appointing just one person to our board of advisors.......even if they never attend one meeting in person, You could single handedly catapult this project to instant success.......

Governor Bush,
I will make this short - if the insurance situation (both residential and commercial) is not fixed in Florida soon it is going to have a staggering affect on our economy.  
 
I am a commercial real estate appraiser.  I am seeing the market tighten up significantly and I hear the same thing from the market - the cost of insurance is high and the quality of insurance is poor.  Investors looking at a property that looked like a good investment are walking away once they look into the cost of insurance.  If the insurance crisis affects the real estate market those two segments will take are economy into a downward spiral that may take years to sort out.  Thank you for your time.

Good Day,
 
I am writing you today as a long time Florida Citizen who sadly now must consider moving out of the state I grew up in because it is becoming less affordable to live here. I beg all of you to consider your citizens.
 
My family moved us to Florida when I was 7 years old, I am now almost 43 and raising my own family. We are a family of four that makes less than $50,000 a year. We are not part of your "rich & retired" population, we are your working class Citizen/Voter/American. It took us years to save up to purchase our own home, scrimping and saving and working while raiding our children but we did it and were so happy. The property taxes were affordable and the insurance equaled about one house payment each year which was affordable.
 
Last  September our homeowners insurance totaled about $504.00. We expected it to double after all the hurricanes the past two years but we were not prepared to find that our insurance company was going bankrupt (Southern Family, part of The Poe group.) Nor were we prepared to find that NO company that we called would insure our home because it is 20 years old and a wood frame house other than Citizens, the state run insurance. Citizens has not even promised to keep us covered come September 2006, but if they it will cost us a little over $3000 (about 5 times more than what we were paying) . MAPI has not been able to produce a company that will cover us.
 
Meanwhile our property taxes keep going up, our interest rates keep increasing and now our city is talking about assessing our area for water and sewer lines at a price that will be just $10,000 -- $15,000 less than what our mortgage was for.  We are seriously looking at moving to another state and starting our lives all over which is a scary proposition.
 
While our governments (local, state and federal) Consider the rights of people who broke the law to come to our country, there seems to be little talk about those of us who are Americans or at least legal citizens who work and pay taxes and do not drain the local economy.
 
Please, I beg of you to look into insurance programs that will assist the lower income working class people in Florida before we are all priced right out of living here.

Hello, I have lived in Florida 32 years and am a regular working person, First of all, with no insurance claims in 30 years, and 1 claim 2 years ago, now my insurance went up 300%. MAY WAGES DID NOT.

MY ELE BILL WENT UP 40% SAME MONTH LAST YEAR, MY WAGES DID NOT 
We can not move to another home, as the PRICES are up ,and out price us, If we could buy one, we could not pay the taxes on it ?

YOU / WE, have a real problem here, SOON we as others will have a vehicle reposed ,so we can pay our. bills, as OUR WAGES did not increase to come close to cover any of these costs??

People on fixed income as my Mom, may have to drop insurance all together ,and take a chance, as she CAN NOT KEEP PAYING these costs.

Thanks 
you 
hope you know how MESSED up things really are in the REAL WORLD ,IN YOU STATE !!

My name Is Reverend Bradley D. VanCleef and I have a question. The property values where artificially inflated in the state to recoup losses created by the past couple of years storms. It now seems that property values are being furthar driven to insane values by property flip-floppers. My question is what are you doing for the thousands of families that have lived in florida since before it was even a State. We're being pushed out of our home state after may generations of our families where born here, labored here and died here. Most of our jobs in the state don't compare to the northern states pay rates. There's just something fundamentally wrong with the direction the states taking.

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
On behalf of all nursing home residents in the state of Florida I urge you to reconsider your decision to veto nursing home funding and to do whatever is possible with the power entrusted to you by your people, to reverse the effects of your veto of appropriation 243.
 
My husband, Mack Joel Richardson, is a resident of Southlake Nursing Home here in Jacksonville.  He will be in a nursing home permanently because he suffers from Parkinson's disease and what has been diagonised as Parkinson's type dementia.
He is a veteran of the Korean Conflict.
He worked hard all his teen and adult life,  to provide for his family saving and believing we would be able to care for ourselves in our "golden" years.  But due to rising costs this is not going to be possible for much longer.  Without some state aid we may  well find ourselves homeless.
 
So I ask you to please reconsider your decision and due all you can to  rectify it.
We have supported you and believe as a person of honor you have the strength of character to do this.
 
Most sincerely,
 
Corinne (Mrs. M. Joel) Richardson

I had to cut my other e-mail short because of a bad electrical storm yesterday evening.
 
I can not help wondering why our "esteemed" Governor is procrastinating so long doing something about this insurance crisis.  Would he procrastinate like this if he or one of his immediate family was being forced to lose their home and the equity they had in it, like thousands of the people that put him in office are???????  Because of this procrastination and the point this crisis has reached, an IMMEDIATE moratorium on premium increases MUST BE ENACTED and made retroactive, as outlined in my other e-mail, until a full audit and investigation of Citizens Insurance Co. can determine where all these funds are going.  The government and the people can not keep pouring good money after bad into this bottomless pit.  Once that moratorium is put in place the state will have to "let the chips fall where they may" until solutions to these problems can sensibly be worked out.  The leaders of this state have to face the fact that this whole crisis has been brought about by excessive insurance rates which are doing nothing but driving people out of their homes, effecting the economy and driving good people out of the state.
 
I have almost 50 years as a homeowner in Florida, 12 years in Dade County and the rest in Pasco County.  I also have two sons, with their families in Lee County and an adult Grandson in Marion County.  In all my experience I have never seen such inequities in premium rates from county to county as what the insurance companies are doing in this state. On top of that Citizens Insurance Co. is using those erroneous actuarial tables to figure their rates. Isn't it time our Insurance Commissioner and his department make some rules for insurance companies to follow instead of letting them make the rules so that they make big profits first without regard for the insured.
 
In closing I repeat that it is IMPERATIVE THAT AN IMMEDIATE MORATORIUM ON INSURANCE RATE INCREASES BE ENACTED as stated above.  Immediate does not mean 3 weeks, a month or more, it means NOW!!!!!!

Governor Bush: 
 
First of all let me take this opportunity to thank you for all the wonderful programs you have provided your constituents during your terms as Governor of the Great State of Florida. 
 
I am writing regarding our Homestead Exemption laws.
I encourage you to help those of us who are held prisoner in our current homesteaded homes. I for one live on the Gulf Coast at Horseshoe Beach.  Ten years ago I purchased my slice of heaven for $38,000 with today's value at nearly $300,000.  My current homesteaded taxes are approximately $500 a year, should I sell my current home and purchase a home elsewhere of equivalent value my taxes would rise to well over $7,500.00.  As I am on a limited fixed income I could not afford the new taxes.  Many of my friends, associates and your constituents are in the same situation. 
 
Even though I dearly love Horseshoe Beach  I now find, due to my ever increasing age of 73 (damn)  I  longer can handle the constant threat of increasing hurricanes and storm surges.  That  plus having difficulties climbing stairs to my elevated home. (A FEMA recommendation) I find I have some hard decisions to make.  A decision to move to a safe heaven and a lower standard of life with real estate taxes consuming  1/4 of my income ....or to continue living or in harms way.  
 
In addition to helping those of us locked into terrifying situations a new bill enabling those in my situation to sell and buy a homes....... would be a great boast to Florida's economy....you would see an unbelievable  surge  increase in property sales.  
 
Thanking you in advance for any help you can send our way.

Dear Govenor Bush,
I am sending you this note to let you know how very upset I am concerning this property tax issue for new residents.  I purchased my home from a builder two (2) years ago and it took him two (2) years to build the house before we could move in.  My taxes at time of purchase, we were told by the building staff and real estate offices, that it would be around 3 to four thousand dollars.  Now that we have lived here for about 4 months we were informed that it could cost up to $8,000 per year to live here.  I don't mind paying my FAIR SHARE, but another house one mile away is larger and more property involved is paying $3,400.00.  JUST BECAUSE HE HAS LIVED HERE LONGER, WHAT IS FAIR ABOUT THAT.
To me it sounds unfair, unconstitutuinal, bias, and prejudice.
Did the goverment of Florida ever think this would not come back to hurt anyone????????????????????
I have spokent to many, many people living in Florida and they all think that it is outrageous.  
WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM??????
I reside in Hernando county and they assess the property at 100% of selling value.  They just changed this rule in the last 10 months.  What are they trying to do, make up for lost time or should I say MONEY.
I do hope this is an issue that will be looked at in the near futrue, if not I  along with many others will have to move out of this state as many others have already done.  This time last year in Hernando county there were 3 to 4 hundred homes for sale, at this time now there are  4,000 homes for sale. and they are not being sold.  
I beg you please do something about this or I will loose my home.
I thank you for taking the time to read this leltter.

I think if you extended your sale till the 5th of the month more people could take advantage of it. my wife is Florida school teacher and i have heard many parents say they don't get paid until the first.                                                             thank you for reading this letter.

Attached please find a letter sent to Mr. McCarty with my very great concerns:  

 

Florida Department of Financial Services

Office of the Commissioner

200 East Gaines Street

Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0305

850-413-3140

Attn: Kevin M. McCarty

 

Dear Mr. McCarty:

 

I called your office last year when Citizens insurance would no longer insure my home and my policy was transferred to Gulfstream.  I have never had an insurance claim placed for my property, yet a 45% increase was added to the already taxed burden of high insurance costs that I was paying.  Your office told me that due to the hurricanes, all insurance would increase across the state of Florida and there was nothing that could be done, except to shop around. Shopping around was not easy, nor did less expensive offers materialize.  I had no other choice than to take my son out of guitar lessons and my daughter out of dance classes so I could pay the additional premium.

 

I just received the proposed insurance cost for my property.  I paid last year $3402.00.  for my home insurance, not including flood, which was a separate bill. The new premium, due in September, will be $6770.00, an increase of 99.10%.  I can’t cut back anymore to pay this additional premium.  I am a nurse practitioner and make a decent living.  However, I only get a 3% annual increase on my salary, working for the biggest employer in South Florida, the Baptist Health System.  I mention this, because I imagine that many people get less than this amount for a raise annually, working for smaller companies.

 

I find however, that my 3% increase, sans taxes, does not go very far.  With increased costs of living, including food prices and gasoline prices that are ridiculous, there is not much left for frivolous spending.  I ask this question:  If I, who has a Master’s level education with a post graduate certificate in nursing education and an advanced registered nurse practitioner license can’t afford to pay these exorbitant insurance premiums, then how can the average family with salaries much lower than mine pay for these ridiculous premiums? What about the many single moms that are out there struggling to make ends meet?  What about the elderly such as my own parents that live on very low fixed incomes?  I have to help my parents financially.  Are you asking that I let my parents starve to death such that I can pay for my home insurance?  Since I am not fortunate enough to be wealthy enough to pay off my mortgage, and since the bank mandates home insurance to protect their investment, and since I can’t pay my premiums, are you asking that my family loose their home, get foreclosed on by the bank and move out into the streets?

 

I can’t cut any more corners.  I can’t pay these premiums.  A 99.10% increase in addition to a 45% increase last year is not acceptable.  We need to eat and live.  What will next year bring?  A 200% increase?  Soon we will all be working to pay for homeowner’s insurance and nothing else. 

 The number of foreclosed properties in Florida will very soon triple or quadruple as innocent victims to these insurance rates realize that they can no longer afford their mortgages secondary to absurd insurance premiums and the enormous amounts of money that must be placed in escrow to pay for them.

 

 As insurance commissioner, I would like to know what your reply to my and I’m sure many other Floridians’ same question:  “What is our state government doing to prevent this from happening?”  Please note, we need action NOW, not a promise that new legislation will come at some future date to ease the pain.  I can’t pay these premiums, due in September 2006.  I pay taxes, lots of them.  I want my government to take action and resolve this situation before I lose my home. Your web page (http://www.floir.com/director/) states the words “FAIR, FAST, PROFESSIONAL”.  I expect a fair, fast and professional response to my letter with action and resolution.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear Elected official, 
This note is to encourage all parties and all members of State of Florida lawmakers to help assist present homeowners and future homeowners with more affordable property taxation based on realistic 1999 numbers.  All homeownership in our country is called our American Dream. Not anymore, homeownership has become a privilege to fewer and fewer fellow americans who wish to have a family growth on a secured home environment. The mortgage industry has provided with very creative financial vehicles like 50 year mortgages, negative amortization features, interest only etc. but we are running out of realistic options, we can not save anymore,  we could never say life our grand-fathers and even fathers did and were able to say this will be my home in 15-20 years we could pay this off and have an
asset to retire....not anymore...401k's are no longer affordable.  Property taxes more than ever are an increasing obstacle to become a homeowner.  Property values have almost doubled and even tripled in the past 7 years but perceived property tax benefits have not, they have actually remained very much to pre-1999's (house value increase era) and we are not doing anything to make it better. Yes we have had a great budget surplus for 2006-2007 but really at what cost? No new added benefits for the increased taxation has been created. Let's get something back to homeowners who worked hard in keeping the dream alive and let's give them an opportunity to be able to purchase a larger or different home without penalizing them with unjustified taxation.  Let's at the same time give the new
homeowners an increase in homestead deduction from $25,000 to $100,000 as long as this does not exceed 50% of the property value. Let's give our fellow americans a chance to be able to live our dream, our American Dream.

Subject:	Insurance, porperty values, jobs,loans    A storm is brewing

A few months ago, I was very comfortable that our commercial property investments would provide adequate security and income for our retirement after working 43 years.  The receipt of one letter saying our insurance coverage for all properties, carried with the same company for at least ten or more years without a single claim of any description "WILL NOT BE RENEWED."    Going to the market I quickly learned that if, "IF" insurance could be written the premium might be in the low to mid six figures.  Last year, total premiums for all properties for total coverage was @ 23,000.00   
 
At this writing, I am self insured, along with my tenants who might be out of business because their insurance has also been "NON RENEWED"    
 
What is my property worth now ?  Buyers won't shouldn't and in most cases can't buy property without insurance.  Lenders won't place new mortgages on un insured properties.   
What is the tax assessment of an uninsured, un occupied property ?  Is Florida going to lower our taxes ?
 
Homeowners are in the same sinking boat.
 
So far it appears that the executive branch and the legislature are too busy posturing  for re election to be bothered with a minor insurance glitch in the State of Florida.  
 
My view is that if this issue is not addressed immediately (30 to 45 days)  the economy of Florida will be so far in the tank and every highway leading out of Florida will be bumper to bumper.  That is of course if one can afford enough gasoline to get out of here.  
Ad a hurricane into the equation, tis the season.   
 
Governor Jeb,  you are still Governor and this issue is playing out on your watch.  You have come through every time when the chips were down.  Don't let us down in the back stretch of you leadership.

Subject:	Healthcare in Florida

Dear Governor,

 

I’m amazed at the lack of government intervention into the healthcare issues in Florida.  Although these issues are not unique to Florida, I deal with them first hand as the chief executive of a PPO network based in New Port Richey.  You might say I have an insider’s perspective.

 

My most significant challenges in delivering a competitive health insurance network (offering savings to group health plans at contracted doctors and hospitals) are with the business practices used by large group health carriers and hospitals.

 

Despite my best efforts to provide a competitive PPO product in this state, a number of hospitals (mostly for-profits, but not all) refuse to contract with my company at a competitive reimbursement levels.  Or at least a level competitive with Blue Cross or United Healthcare.  Why would a for-profit or community based hospital not want to create more competition in the market?   Is competition in the group health market a bad thing?   Who loses… the buyer!

 

Additionally, I’ve seen numerous examples of hospitals charging at levels 3-5 time greater then that paid by Medicare, particularly for outpatient services.   By example, do you think it’s fair to get charged twice (at $4,500 ea) for an operating room because you had two procedures done at the same time?  Additionally, do you think it’s fair to go to a hospital without any obligation to disclose intended costs?  What else do we buy without knowing the cost?  Nothing!  These billing practices have to end, be more transparent, become much more consumer friendly, and allow for competitive alternatives.

 

On the part of the carriers…. Ask any agent, salesman, or consultant about the group health discounts associated with BCBS, United Health, Aetna, Cigna, or Humana health plans.  I unison they will throw out numbers ranging from 45-75% discounts.   These are the numbers that are given out by the carriers when asked.  The calculation of a network discount is complex but in short, they are all engaging in the process of providing false information in the process of a sale to their clients.   I’ve personally seen bids where a carrier will mark every claim at a 75% discount.  You can’t audit a carrier, and in many cases you can’t even get a report of your own company’s claims history with a carrier.  “Sorry that’s proprietary…. , but here’s your 15% premium increase. “ 

 

This is the same problem uncovered in the P&C consulting scandal which started in New York and is now in Florida.   It amounts to the commission of fraud, on a grand scale, against the people of Florida.  When you hire a group health consultant to assist in choosing a health insurance plan… shouldn’t you know how much the consultant and his company are being paid by each carrier that they represent?  Shouldn’t the carrier have to disclose their contract rates, their true discounts?  It’s the same P&C issue… lack of disclosure.   Carriers won’t disclose their claims information to a group because A) They don’t line up with the sales projected savings, and B) It makes it easier to shop carrier and reinsurance products.   Does this work… YES!  Just look at the profit and stock gains by the major carriers over the past three years.

 

If you ever get the chance to review a United Healthcare report for a large group, you will get an eyeful.  I have one on my desk… Group Savings over $2.4 million dollars…. When you look through the report… they also counted disallowed claims (duplicate claims, elective surgery, etc) as savings.  For this particular client they saved 69%!   That’s just outright mis-information.

 

Regulation is the key to good, faithful, and fruitful competition.  By example: utilities, the phone company, banking and brokerage, and soon the P&C industry will have all gone through greater regulation.    Healthcare needs the same treatment… sooner than later.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am a resident of Hillsborough Cty, Fl.  My husband is retired at 65 and has numerous health issues.  I am still working at 62 and see no retirement for me in the near future.  My concern is that our property taxes doubled last year and now State Farm has been granted at least a 50% plus increase.  My home is not paid for and these increases has added a lot to our house payment.  I get very upset when I hear that our government is spending all of this money in other countries (which could care less about the USA) and does not seem to be concern about our own citizens.  Because of medical expenses and other growing expense we may very well not be able to keep our home because of these increases.  No one seems to be doing anything about the burden that this has put on the seniors.  I don’t make that kind of money and my husband’s S/S retirement is less than $1500.00 per month. We get no help from anyone.  You tell me where the justice to our American citizens is.  When I received my last raise, I did not get a 50% increase or double my salary.  When is government going to start helping our own people, before lending a hand to outsiders?  When we allow the immigrates to come into this country, they received free medical service or almost free, but yet the working people are paying for our service and theirs too, because someone has to cover the cost.
I think the US Government needs to put the US Citizens first.  Don’t get me wrong, I love my country and proud to be an American,
But enough is enough.  I have worked all my life along with my husband and we have never asked for handouts.  But to get to this point in our lives and see the injustice being done, I really don’t think that it fair.

Re:  â€œReinsuranceâ€.

Governor:

I hope and plead with you to change your mind and not get the state into the insurance business again.  

I read the article in the Orlando Sentinel today regarding your proposed business reinsurance program with dismay and trepidation.  Between you, Tom Lee and Tom Gallagher Iâ€™m already getting taxed to death to help pay for insurance for the people who CHOOSE to live in storm prone areas.  Now, Iâ€™ll be paying even more for someone else to live high on the hog!

Remember â€œCitizensâ€ insurance?  That was and is a financial disaster for taxpayers like myself.  It was helped by the state hiring crooks that knew nothing about the insurance industry to run (steal from) the company.  What makes you think the State or any Government agency can do a good job? 

I challenge you to identify any segment of the government that does a better job than private industry.  Here are a few that come to mind for me:

Schools are a disaster with kids graduating who cannot read or write.  We would be better off with all state funding tied to the child and allowing parents to choose where there kids go to school.

Child protective services canâ€™t find hundreds of kids supposed to be in their care.  Interestingly enough whenever I move many businesses that I did business with but did not tell I moved are able to find me, why canâ€™t the state do the same?

State bureaucrats canâ€™t figure out how to authorize cameras at intersections used to fine red light runners to save lives!  Funny that both the State and Orange County use cameras to fine you for running a toll!

With gas prices going sky high our Central Florida government officials choose to raise hotel and car rental taxes to fund an arena for a multi-millionaire, an arts program and re-building of the Citrus bowl.  I predict the result will be less tourism because the cost of coming and staying here will be too great for too many people.

I believe the more you can stay out of business the better it is for me.

Dear Governor Bush,
    I am a condo owner in a 55 & older community.  We are average Americans.  We are not wealthy nor are we poor.  We are all average retired workers.  We pay our bills.  We abide by our laws.  The words "fixed income" are our way of life as well as our reality.  When we retired, we planned out our futures to the penny and we budgeted accordingly.  We did not plan to worry about losing our homes because of unrestricted gouging and unrestricted power by the big profiting insurance companies.  We are literally caught in a Catch 22.  Why can't the insurance companies have a cap on their profits?  Why can't insurance companies be prohibited from selling auto insurance in states where they refuse to sell both home and auto insurance?  There are many people who don't have car insurance for whatever reason, and they still blatantly drive around as they please.  Sure we could drop our individual home owner coverage and we may be forced into that situation.  The state of Florida has the right to deny business with companies that selectively eliminate or refuse to cover people because they just don't want to have to pay off claims when we do have disaster damage.  Why are we being discriminated against?  How can you allow this?  This isn't hard to understand economics, it's common sense.  I implore you to act swiftly before you enable more people to wind up on welfare or homeless.  The law states that condo associations must have insurance for all buildings, but the insurance companies reap enormous profits and turn around and suddenly demand double the fees for coverage.  We have planned to the penny.  Therefore we do not have the money to be raped.  Why is this legal?  We sell our condos because we can't afford the exorbitant assessments or the enormous inflated rate increases in monthly fees, but there is no where to go, no way to resettle.  We can't get mortgages without insurance.  Why are banks allowed to set restrictions and the insurance companies aren't restricted at all?  Tell me what are we supposed to do?  What will you do to help us now?  Today, not tomorrow is the fear on everyone's shoulders.  
        With all due respect, please don't bother having one of your clerks send me a preprinted response with an excuse or the unrelated reasons you are not able to make a change for us, or tell me the good stuff you plan on doing for us.  We need you to make changes for us today!  I am not so naive that I believe my letter will ever be seen by you, but I do know that I am not alone here.  There are thousands of us imploring you to act for us to protect us.  You represent us.  You were not elected to represent huge profiting insurance companies.  Fair is fair, and we are not being treated fairly.  Please helpl

                Dear Governor Bush:
                About six weeks ago, I wrote to you concernig the Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program, specifically requesting that Mobile Homes be included in that program, in order that Mobile Homes might qualify for Hurricane Shutters. Did you ever receive that letter???    I  know I'm not too swift on e-mails, but I was pretty sure I sent it properly.   I didn't expect an answer from you personally, but I thought maybe one of your staff would have give me the courtesy of a reply.   I was able to learn that there is a Mobile Home Program in development, but I am under the impression it is for Mobil Homes in parks, but not individual Mobiles on private property.  I understand a Mr. Gerald Schilling is the contact person at Tallahassee Community College for this program.   I would appreciate it if you could call him and ask him to include Mobile Homes on private property in this program so that we would be eligible for the matching grants to be able to afford Hurricane Shutters.

Govenor Jeb Bush
 
My name is John Hodgson.  My wife, Mickey and I have lived in Coral Springs, Fl. for over
46years.  We're ready to retire soon and start enjoying Florida.  We've both worked hard 
and purchased a lot on Nettles Island in Jensen Beach, Fl. about 26 years ago. My wife
works for the Broward School Board and I drove trucks for 50 to 70 hours a week  We
bought our little lot as a second home and place to vacation with the kids during summer 
and on weekends as I could not take vacations.  Our goal was to retire there and live the 
rest of our lives.
 
My beef is the escalating property values. We will probably have to sell our lot because we
won't be able to afford the taxes and insurance. My assessed value on the lot in 2004 was 
218,000, In 2005 it jumped over 70% to $375,000. The taxes over doubled and our income 
is going down. We can't homestead our second home, even though both places are in Fl.
Is  or can anything be done to stop this and protect us older people hoping to retire and not 
be forced to stop living as we should?  We don't want to sell as we put a lot of  time and work
into that place. I'm not looking forward to next years tax information. I don't mind paying my 
fair share but this is ridiculous...  We would appreciate anything you could do or are doing to 
help our situation.     Sincerely,  John & Mickey Hodgson.   mckyxny@aol.com

Subject:	[*] Moving out of Florida

Dear Governor and elected members to the State of
Florida,

I have resided in the state of Florida for the
last four years.  As you are aware there have
been some very trying times that have faced many
Floridians. After living in Puerto Rico for the
last six years, I was very happy and excited
about moving to and living in Florida.  Having
lived in Puerto Rico, and dealing with hurricanes
was not an overwhelming concern. The rewards of
living in Florida seem to out weight the
unpredictable hurricane seasons.  
 
I have just received my insurance premium and it
has tripled from last year, while coverage has
been increased ever so slightly.  This directly
impacts my house payment, increasing it by more
than $520.00 per month.  

I will retire in approximately 21 months and at
the current rate of the tax and insurance
increases that have gone unchecked, I will take
my retirement and move to another state.  If the
opportunity presents itself, I may depart sooner.
 I am not alone in this concern.  Many law
enforcement officers with whom I have served
with, in the federal government and the state of
Florida for more than 20 years have already
departed, for the same reasons aforementioned. 

I recently purchased property in Arkansas.
Interested families visiting the developers
offered properties numbered in the 60’s -70’s per
three- hour presentation. The sales
representatives have four presentations every
weekend. Of those families attending, almost all
were from Florida.  All voicing the same concerns
of increase in taxes and homeowners insurance
premiums.  They also expressed the lack of
intervention by our elected officials. This issue
has, not only impacted the ability for homeowners
to sell their property, but for new homeowners
the ability to purchase property.  Did I mention,
during the three-hour time presentation that I
attended, I witnessed twenty-seven properties
being sold.

I am certain that if I have taken the time to
address this important issue, there have been
more.  I am not willing to reside in a state
where the government can not or will not provide
a safe and affordable haven.  I have worked to
long, to hard in the military and in law
enforcement to live a state that does not care
look over the residents.



Thank you,

Re:  High property taxes, and insurance crisis.
Governor Bush,
 
       I read in the paper, that finally your Administration is giving acknowledgement to the grave crisis;  that is endangering the well being of Floridians.  Any human being  has the right to have shelter; to have a place to live in. 
 
        The abusive cost of housing, ( for renters and  buyers alike),
is a  crime that cries for justice.  It might not be a crime in the eyes of the law; but indeed it is  abusive, it is  degrading, it is  repulsive the way  we Floridians are being treated, by those we have elected.  Housing cost is indecent.  The way insurance companies have been allowed, by politicians in power, to basically "rape" us, (that's how it feels), cries to the eyes of God.
      
     Yet, up to now; Florida's government has chosen to hide it's collective neck like the ostriches, and deny there is any problem; or deny that there is need for a solution.  One of our politicians, had the gall to say in a local radio station, that there was nothing politicians could do, at this point!!
     
     Now, that businesses are also being threatened by the insurance fiasco; 
now, our state politicians, (and you Governor Bush, among them),  feel you should put a "band aid", to a "patient" that is basically bleeding to death....
     
    The idea of addressing only the needs of businesses, (and forgetting us),  is preposterous. The idea creating an insurance , similar to the failure known as Citizens, (not even my 3 years old grand niece, would think of doing that!)
  The idea of  having a higher deductible, or not covering hurricane damage for businesses...come on Governor Bush.  Are you, (Administration, State and Senate), really trying to meet our needs?  It sounds like, you want us to give charitable and free contributions to insurance companies.
 
     Simple ideas that could help, to alleviate our suffering:
 
a)  Raise the Homestead Exemption for everyone, to $50,000.  Not just people who are hundreds of years old, with an income of $600/year. 
 
b) Don't raise the property taxes, for the main residence of owners who are 65 years old, or older; and earn less than $50,000/year.  Elderly people, who have worked all their lives, are loosing their homes.
 
c) Curb the stealing, waste and wanton spending of our tax dollars.  Now , is the low-income housing construction.  Yesterday, it was the gift, shared by a few,  of moneys from a tax for the Firefighters department.  The day before yesterday, it was the money stolen in the Airport and the Port of Miami, among many other crimes.  Criminals involved in such thieveries are never made to give the money back!  This has to change.  The money saved from such robberies could be invested back into the community.
 
d)  We should have more choices of property insurance companies.  Perhaps medical insurances; could be made to have a chapter, or to offer house insurance as well.  Demand of insurance companies; that if they want to do business with us; they must be fair and just.
 
e) We as citizens need to stop making  legal, and acceptable the influence that lobbyists dangling money in front of politicians; buying favors, as   a man buys favors from a woman at a street corner.    
 
             "Wish unto others, what you want for yourself."  This is my message, (and I am sure the message of many voters), for Florida's politicians in government.  Don't bother with band-aid solutions, last minute, (before elections) non-solutions.  Don't bother to come down to our neighborhoods, (in the case of Latins, with guayabera shirts, offering "cafe con leche", "pastelitos" and empty promises)... You are smart individuals, you are well learned and prepared. That is why , we voted for all of you.   The future of our nation, and in this case of our state, is based on decisions you make today.
 
              Politicians: if you still love our country : show it!  Politicians, if you want our votes:  show it! Leave selfishness, lobbyists'  interests aside.
                                                                       Respectfully,
                                                                          Alina Valdes

Dear Governor John Bush:

I am writing today to respectfully request your support for SB 772.
The portion of this large education bill that most concerns me relates to childhood obesity. I know that you care about this issue, too, as evidenced by the task force you created and the resulting Obesity Summits.
As your task force recommended, this bill will empower parents to help improve their children’s health.
In addition, SB 772 will help improve academic achievement in Florida. Healthy students are better students – with increased test scores, concentration and attendance, and reduced discipline problems.


SB 772 will encourage parents, communities, students and schools to work together in the fight against childhood obesity.  
In the U.S., the percentage of overweight children has more than doubled, and the percentage of overweight adolescents has tripled in the past 30 years. In Florida, the trend is similar.
Almost 60% of these overweight children have at least one heart or stroke risk factor, and 25% had two or more risk factors.
The implications of childhood obesity are far-reaching. If childhood obesity continues to increase, the current generation of children and the ones behind them will face devastating health and economic consequences.
Many studies and reports support the connection between academic achievement and student health. We cannot expect our children to excel if they are not physically fit.


Gov. Bush, I know you care about our children. Please demonstrate your support by signing SB 772 into law and helping us all work together on the solutions to childhood obesity.
Thank you in advance for your support.

Dear Mr. Bush:  My husband and I are constituents of yours and your brother the President.  I am writing to you to advise you of my outrage at the homeowners insurance situation in this state.  I have been insured with Vanguard for the past l0 years with never a claim.  I have just been advised by them that I will not be renewed because they are reducing their exposure to catastrophic events.  I have further been advised that Citizens is the only company writing at this time and they have quoted me 200% above what I was already paying and they require the money up front at the time of writing of the policy.  Explain to me Mr. Bush how ordinary hardworking people are supposed to afford insurance at these rates?  How am I supposed to come up with that kind of money in a couple of months when I have a sick husband and two children to support?  Why is it that nothing is being done by your and your brother’s administration to help the people of  Florida out?  I have lived in Florida all of my life and we are now being forced to move out of Florida to  a more affordable location.  Why can’t you and your brother make it so that if insurance companies want to write policies in all of the other states of the United States, then they should be forced to write policies in Florida as well or they cannot conduct business.  It is criminal what is being done to the people of the State of Florida while you and your brother stand by and let it happen.  What’s going to happen to us when a huge hurricane comes and our homes are destroyed and we have no money to rebuild and no insurance to cover us?  What these insurance companies and our government is doing to us is a criminal act and should be treated as such.  You can rest assured that I will no longer vote Republican ever again.  I have been a staunch republican for all of my life, however, I will now change parties and will NEVER vote Republican again.  I will never ever vote for anyone in your family again because you have allowed us all to get railroaded and are doing nothing to protect the citizens of your state.

Can it be stopped? With home resales down 29% in Florida as a whole, and down 34% in the Tampa area, and down 49% in Pasco county and all going further down every day, it is very doutful that ruination hasn't already come upon Florida's housing market. It is doubtful that the downhill roll to complete collapse can be reversed even by someone with an understanding of the causes of the problem and of the actions necessary to correct it.   
   You obviously do not intend to do the one and only thing that may reverse the complete collapse of Florida's economy. Just today I read where you are calling for a Citizens like plan for business property insurance. Yes, that proven disaster Citizens!

Governor Bush,

 

Good Morning.  I am sure you are confronted with plenty of emails on the subject of property taxes within the state on a daily basis.  Not until recently has it affected us that I feel compelled to write you this note.  

 

My husband and I bought our house in 2000 in Boca Raton, FL.  We were one of the “fortunate” ones to be able to do so for the real estate boom.  I would consider us well above average in our household income ($160K and above) and we do have 2 small children.  We bought our house as a starter home (2 BR) in one of Boca’s eastern neighborhoods, with the intention to upgrade as our careers and finances grew.  Six years later we are currently in the middle of a major renovation because to move within Boca Raton was simply out of the question.  Housing prices were through the roof and to purchase even a comparable property would break the budget with tax increases.  

 

Recently, we have been approached about a possible career move for my husband to the Gainesville, FL area.  This could potentially be an excellent career move and a great place to raise our family.  As you know, South Florida can be a bit busy at times.  Regardless, the tax situation makes it out of the question to move to this area because even though we would get double the property from what we have here, our tax outlay annually would be in excess of $10-11K dollars. 

 

Enough of the story, you get the idea.  Missed opportunities, etc, etc.  It is front page news daily of how the real estate market has cooled but what is being done about making it attractive for the natives to better their lifestyle or be allowed to make life changes without facing crippling taxes?

 

I would appreciate your reply and good luck with the rest of your term. 

 

Regards,

YOUR EXCELLENCY MR.GOVERNOR JEB BUSH:
Our state turism,  and economy has been affected because of the Citizens insurance rates and increase in property value by citizens insurance,  and not by the marked value , or the county assessements.
We need a change in home policy in which the package is eliminated.Noone in general has 110 th dls. in personal property.Each owner must declare their own PERSONAL property about 30 th and not authomatically 5o per cent out of the total premium.
 
We need a state wide fair insurance rate , and not pick and choose certain areas.
 
All insurance companies must issue policies for the whole state and not for certain areas as they please.Allow a moderate insurance increase to all companies, therefore we all have  a competition choice.
Have an outside    Audit , /Private citizens review committee for Citizens insurance , it seems not well managed.
 
Sink holes situation must be inspected by state or county inspectors.
GENERATE MONEY TO SUPPORT INSURANCE IN THE MAJOR DISASTERS:
STATE   LOTTERY     SHOULD JOIN A POWER BALL OR MEGA  MILLIONS IN ORDER TO GENERATE MORE MONEY, using such profits for  insurance and schools.
Revive the economy and turism and give a break to all Florida residents, visitors and turists.
Give fair a discount  for the homes with fire and burglar alarms and shutters and garage  doors up to the state code."more reseach about safety/secure roof products"

Dear Governor John Bush:

I am writing today to respectfully request your support for SB 772.
The portion of this large education bill that most concerns me relates to childhood obesity. I know that you care about this issue, too, as evidenced by the task force you created and the resulting Obesity Summits.
As your task force recommended, this bill will empower parents to help improve their children’s health.
In addition, SB 772 will help improve academic achievement in Florida. Healthy students are better students – with increased test scores, concentration and attendance, and reduced discipline problems.


SB 772 will encourage parents, communities, students and schools to work together in the fight against childhood obesity.  
In the U.S., the percentage of overweight children has more than doubled, and the percentage of overweight adolescents has tripled in the past 30 years. In Florida, the trend is similar.
Almost 60% of these overweight children have at least one heart or stroke risk factor, and 25% had two or more risk factors.
The implications of childhood obesity are far-reaching. If childhood obesity continues to increase, the current generation of children and the ones behind them will face devastating health and economic consequences.
Many studies and reports support the connection between academic achievement and student health. We cannot expect our children to excel if they are not physically fit.


Gov. Bush, I know you care about our children. Please demonstrate your support by signing SB 772 into law and helping us all work together on the solutions to childhood obesity.
Thank you in advance for your support.

Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] HomeOwners Insurance and Ideas to fix the problem

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I have e-mailed you in the past regarding the serious problem Florida is facing regarding its homeowners.  I have learned that our homeowners insurance company is leaving the state of Florida and will have to find new insurance (in the heart of hurricane season).  Citizens is the only insurance company that will insure us.  We have never put a claim in and we do not live in a flood zone or live never a water way or coastal area...yet we have to pay the price for those who choose to.  Our payment is being increased from $950.00 to 2600.00...this is unacceptable!   My husband is a teacher, in an "A" school, and is working two jobs and I work part-time because I am raising two children, one which has a physical disablity and require therapy 2x's a week, plus we see a specalist-in Houston-once and year or if he requires another surgery (he has had 4).  We are just making our bill now...this increase in our homeowners insurance is going to be overwhelming to say the least.
 
My idea for a solution is this...Insurance companys should not be allowed write auto, health, life or 401B policies without writing homeowners as well.  For example, if an insurance company writes 100 auto insurance policies that company should have to wrtie 20% to homerowners-20 homeowners policies for every 100 auto insurance polocies.  Right now they have their cake and are eating too!  Most of the larger companies are still making profits.  10% of all ohter policies they write (life/401B's) should be for homeowners - 10 out of 100.  
 
Our personal experience, we have our auto insurance with MetLife and a 401B, but they will not write any homeowners policies in the state of Florida...this is not fair.  They are making a profit on us through writing auto and other policies, but will not write policies for homeowners...there should be a penality for this or a fine.  Better yet,  there should be some sort of legislation stating they can NOT write some policies and not another.   If you want to write auto you have to write homeowners as well.  As our Governor I beleive this is up to you.  This is an election year and I believe whoever comes up with a solution to this terrible problem will be elected, re-elected.  
 
Please help our state and the people who live here!!!
 
Sincerely,

Re: Joint Resolution
 
Dear Sir:
 
Enclose recent letter dated July 10, 2006 from Governor Bush.  Governor Bush  explained in his letter, the structure of  Florida’s state constitution; We can only conclude, resolving the discriminates so imbedded in our current Homestead Act, is  that  each house must agree  on ameliorating this disparaging  Homestead tax frame work, so that a fair and equitable tax structures is rendered  for both  Floridians and Snowbirds alike.
 
In order to accomplish a palatable revised tax structure, acceptable by the majority of Florida legislators and property tax indebtednesses, we must emphasis, and believe it is the only course of action to take, is to contract a certified organization to assist in structuring plausible policies that are then submitted to the legislative bodies…. Such authority to seek expertness from without the State of Florida is granted to the Office of Economics and Demographic Research.
 
This letter will also be mailed to your office.  
 
As of this date, you have yet to respond to my letter dated July 10, 2006, E-mailed and mailed via postal Service. 
 
Please knowledge.

Subject:	A solution to the Insurance Crisis using Gap Insurance and Escrow accounts

Have the insured put the money that would have gone to insurance into an escrow account. Letting them drop their conventional insurance.

Give them Gap insurance that covers there house between the amount in their excrow which grows every year and the actual cost to rebuild their home from ground up.

 

Every year their Gap insurance would go down based on the amount they have accumulated in their escrow account. Eventually if the escrow account is equal or greater than the cost to rebuild their home they can drop the gap insurance and stop putting money into the account. Interest earned on the escrow account is deposited into their personal savings account or added back into the escrow account. If the account grows larger than the amount it takes to repair the house then the person gets to withdraw the extra money and put it into their savings account.

 

If the person sells their home they get to keep their escrow money transferring it to their personal account and may transfer the escrow account to apply to their next home. 

 

Why is this reasonable?

 

My parents have to pay the insurance company $6000 a year. Their deductable is also about $6000. When the hurricanes came through the insurance company said they didn’t meet their deductable even though their entire patio roof stripped off and a portion of the main house roof was destroyed. They aren’t able to repair their house. But they did give the insurance company their yearly $6000 which could have been used to repair the house which the insurance company elected to not repair. And yes, I do think the cost of repairing my parent’s home is greater than the $6000 deductable. I believe that the insurance companies are low balling people across the board paying only 60% of the actual cost of repairs and in my parents case just telling them they aren’t meeting their deductable.

 

Their house is completely paid off but they are retired and elderly. They can’t afford to pay for the repairs but that $6000 insurance premium could have been used to pay for the repairs. If the insurance company were to actually pay out my parents would have to pay $6000 for the premium and $6000 for the deductable. So $12,000 would come out of their pockets before seeing any money for repairs. This makes the insurance completely useless and even destructive as it prevents their home from being repaired.

 

Here is how this Gap insurance idea would work for my parents.

 

They put $6000 into the escrow account each year.  If they need to repair their home they can tap the escrow account to replace their roof and do maintenance like add hurricane shutters.  They get full use of the $6000 they would have sent to the insurance company. The gap insurance covers them for the amount of money between the cost of their home should it be destroyed or the difference between the total amount of repairs and the amount in the escrow account.

 

The $6000 earns interest which can be added back into the escrow or deposited into their personal savings account. 

 

If they die or sell their home the money goes into their savings account or to the heirs.

Subject:	[*] reason for SPECIAL session

Jeb,
   It is my idea to call a special session for insurance for the following reasons:
 
                     If insurance companies requires 50% to 100% increase for the reason of paying for damage, then they should figure into the balance NOT paying for the damage this way:    1) After two years of a relativity normal season, refunding 25% of this increased revenue.  2) Based on a normal (average) two (2) year period, a figure should be designed to calculate the "Normal" or "Average" costs that are incurred for insurance companies. This would set the standards for my idea. 
 
 
       For instance: I paid $---   last year for insurance and was increased 50% next year, nothing happened for those two years and the insurance company calculated that it would.   They would be able to KEEP 25% of that increase for future devastations, I in return would benefit from the calm season that we had. ( A two 2 year turnover might be subject to change!  , make it 3 or 4 year, but the idea is there.)
 
                   The Insurance companies still gain 25% and the general public still believes they should stay in Florida instead of moving to be able to afford the increases in this needed insurance. Once the insurance companies collects this increase that has been approved, it will never be seen again unless this is passed into law.  
 
              Anotherwords
  I will forgive where my money went over the past 15 years, but I sure want to know where it is going for the next 15 years. 
 
I have a lot more on this subject that WILL work
It is all in a win win situation

Subject:	FW: Wind Poll Coverage for Charlotte County

 

 

Dear Mr. Bush,

 

 

I am Commodore of the Charlotte Harbor Yacht Club in Port Charlotte, Florida.  We finally reopened our club on March 26, 2006  for the first time since August 13, 2004.  I am writing you concerning the lack of Wind Coverage available in Charlotte County.  I am writing not only  for our club, but for the many other businesses in Charlotte County that are facing the same problems.  

To update you on our situation, we have had 2 quotes on wind coverage. After incurring a $3.5 million-hurricane loss, our club has come back with great resilience. I have learned that Charlotte County is only now working on admittance to the Florida Wind Pool, which is very disconcerting since everyone realizes the great devastation caused by Charley has led the insurance companies to withdraw any reasonable coverage in our county.

 

Our insurance broker has been trying to secure wind coverage for many months and found only one option available to us. This option is through Lexington Insurance Company, Greensboro, NC. The premium for $2,500,000 in coverage is $435,375 plus interest with a $300,040 deductible.  Gary Sullivan, a member of our Insurance Committee also obtained a quote through Brown and Brown Agency. Wind coverage for the building for a 3.6M limit and contents limit of .5M at Berkshire-Hathaway for $205,000 with a $300K deductible.  Needless to say both of  these quotes are astronomical and unacceptable.

 

Frank Hokenson, a Yacht Club member and the Insurance Chairman for the Punta Gorda Boat Club, has also had no success with coverage, nor has the Punta Gorda Isles Civic Association, St. Vincent de Paul, and Isles Yacht Club. .  

 

Frank has been instrumental in talking with Robert Hebert , Assistant to the Charlotte County Manager.  I have also spoken with Mr. Hebert, as well as Wayne Sallade, Director of Emergency Management.  I was shocked that Charlotte County had done nothing following Hurricane Charley to get the total County in the Florida Wind Pool.  The barrier islands of Charlotte County are in the pool, so why with so many businesses trying to come back from the devastation do we have to be further delayed by the inability to get wind coverage?  I would hope that the State of Florida would put this grave matter at the top of their list.  While legislation to put our county in the Wind Pool cannot be done until next year, it is my understanding that the Cabinet could act on an Emergency Basis and put all of Charlotte County in the State Wind Pool.  I realize that the Pool provides only $1 Million dollars in coverage, but it makes a huge difference.  If our Yacht Club and other businesses in our situation could get the first million in coverage, then the underwriters would be willing to layer the coverage and it would be much more affordable. 

 

Charlotte Harbor Yacht Club has worked diligently since August 13, 2004 to bring our club back and to become a viable part of this county, I am sure we are one of many.  To now be forced to face a situation of unaffordable Wind Coverage is a very sad thing for this community.  In speaking with Wayne Sallade, he suggested that we email the you and the Cabinet and appeal to you to take immediate action, if we are hit with another hurricane and we have no wind coverage how can we “come back again”?  

 

Thank you for your time and consideration of this very grave situation.  I can be reached at this email address or by phone @ 941-575-6788.  You have been an amazing and caring Governor, and I am sure you will do all you can to help us at this time.

 

Sincerely,

Governor Bush I am a 100% Disabled American Veteran my name is James D. Godwin 162 Park Ave. DeFuniak Springs, FL. 32435, Walton County. I received a letter last week from Florida Family Insurance Company and was told after 14 years of having insurance through them that my Policy would be NON Renewable reason being was given Reduction of Policies in your Geographic area due to exposure management concerns. My insurance with them had jumped from $650.00 annually 2 years ago to almost $1000.00 last year. Now my wife works for Department of Corrections at Walton CI here in DeFuniak and now we are being faced with only 1 insurance company that will provide us Insurance at the $1900. 00 annual mark. And since we have a Mortgage on the house we have to have the insurance. We need some help from the State to help get these Insurance companies in to some kind of check. Basically looks like us Original Floridians born and raised here are being priced right out of the state with the punishing rates that these insurance companies are doing to us and then they just up and leave the state and your insurance is canceled and we end up being thrown to the wolves. Rep. Don Brown from DeFuniak has an Insurance company here in DeFuniak ran by his wife Dianne and they have no one that would insure us because the structure was older than 12 years. She told me that Rep. Brown had been on the Insurance Commissioners back for the last year or so on what these companies were doing to us but it looks like MR. Brown's concerns for his District and the State for that matter has fallen on Deaf ears. Governor Bush before you leave the state we are asking for some kind of help before we are put on the street because we are foreclosed on because we can't afford the Insurance mess here in the state...Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Governor Bush,

 

First let me say that I have been a resident of Florida for 13 years and have had the privilege of voting for you in each of your runs for Governor.  You did a fine job and you will be greatly missed.  Here comes the BUT, as a REALTOR in Hernando County the State’s inaction on the insurance crises has been devastating.  I know, you and the people in the House think they did a good job but go ask the people who are getting the 70-90% increases or can’t get insurance how they think you did.  Not an easy problem to solve and our state government didn’t come close to a good answer.  When talking to agents here in our area all they here about is people moving to TN or NC, our leads for people selling in this area are all for info on those states.  The reason, insurance and taxes.  People here in Hernando County can’t afford to move up because of the higher taxes and insurance and those who wish to down size have the same problem.

 

For your info, our sales absorption rate at the end of June was 13.1 months.  That is the time it would take to sell existing listings against the average monthly sales for first 6 months.  

 

Thanks for letting me vent and for your forum.

Dear Governor Bush. 
 
This is the second time I have written you in reference to the insurance issues in Florida. I wrote Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Tom Gallagher, as well, below is the response I received and my response.
 
----------------------------------------------
 
RE:   Homeowners Nonrenewal and Insurance Rates

Dear Ms. Bryant:

Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Tom Gallagher shared your e-mail with me and asked that I respond on his behalf. We certainly understand your concerns regarding the cancellation or non-renewal of your homeowner's insurance policy as well as the difficulty you are experiencing with the increase in your homeowners’ insurance premium.   

Florida law allows insurance companies to non-renew a customer’s homeowner policy, as long as they give the policyholder at least a 90-day notice, and provide a reason for the non-renewal.  Companies cannot non-renew a policy just for filing a hurricane claim.  However, they are permitted to non-renew the policy if the property no longer meets their underwriting guidelines, or if they choose to randomly select policyholders to reduce the amount of hurricane exposure the company currently possesses.  

In the aftermath of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season, the homeowner insurance industry became one of the most challenging lines of business.  CFO Tom Gallagher is meeting these challenges by working to attract new companies to write this type of coverage.  You can view a list of all the new insurance companies that have been licensed by the Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) via OIR's website at www.floir.com.  Once you are on the homepage, click on "New Companies" in the grey shaded area.

The devastation of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons have caused a most profound affect on insurance costs and availability in our state.  The reality of the situation is the National Hurricane Center predicted we will continue to experience a large number of hurricanes over the next 10 to 20 years.  Although an insurance company cannot raise rates to recoup past losses, they can use the probability of future claims to prepare for future losses.   This must be done in order to assure the company can continue to pay benefits to its customers provided by the policy.    

Another reason for the record increases is the cost of reinsurance.  Reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies.  As a result of the past two unprecedented hurricane seasons, reinsurance has become very expensive and difficult to obtain.  For an example, in 2004 approximately .08 cent of each premium dollar was used to purchase re-insurance.  In 2006, the cost has risen to approximately .92 cent of each premium dollar for reinsurance.  

Also, part of the increase you received may have been a direct result of the assessment for Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens).  Citizens is a Risk Apportionment plan.  This means if there is a monetary deficit for any plan year, Florida law allows Citizens to assess other insurance companies doing business in the State of Florida.  The insurance companies in turn pass the assessment on to their policy holders.  Citizens experienced a deficit of $515 million as a result of claims from the 2004 Hurricane Season. 

Please check with your agent to make sure that you are being given credit for any possible discounts such as hurricane shutters, hurricane clips, and storm windows.  You may also consider increasing your deductible to help lower your premium.  We also encourage you to continue shopping by contacting other agents in your area.  The Florida Market Assistance Plan may also be able to help you locate an insurance agent who is writing property insurance in your area.  Their toll-free number is 1-800-524-9023, or you may access their website at www.fmap.org.

Use the Office’s website (https://apps.fldfs.com/WindMitigation/) to compare the wind mitigation discounts offered by companies writing homeowners insurance in Florida.  Some homeowners have been able to save on insurance premiums because their homes have hurricane shutters and other wind-resistant features.  Low-cost financing may be available to assist with mitigation improvements. 

The legislature also set aside $250 million to help Floridians strengthen their homes to withstand hurricane winds, bringing the total relief for insurance costs to nearly $1 billion.  The $250 million allocation would be used to do free home inspections for homeowners and provide matching grants up to $5,000 for home improvements. This portion of the bill will establish the Florida Comprehensive Hurricane Damage Mitigation Program within the Department of Financial Services.  You may obtain detail information regarding this program via website http://www.mysafefloridahome.com.

If you have additional questions or need assistance with a future insurance concern, please feel free to contact our toll-free Consumer HelpLine at 1-800-342-2762 in state, or 850-413-3132 out-of-state.  An Insurance Specialist will be happy to assist you.  Current information on insurance, banking, and financial issues is available through our free Consumer eViews Newsletter.

My response:
 
Thank you for your response but none of this information helps me. CFO Tom Gallagher didn't even read this email, I bet. I paid my insurance company for six years and they canceled me, just because they felt like it. That is the way I feel and that is the way it is. My insurance company gave me notice a month before hurricane season began, which gives me a lot of time to find someone before hurricane season starts huh? You know I had homeowners insurance, so FEMA wouldn't help me repair the damage I had during those hurricanes of 2004 & 2005. Of course the damage I had was about $100 under what I needed to claim with my insurance company. Amazing, isn't it? I have contacted MANY other insurance companies in my area and EVERYONE is only writing Citizens until AFTER HURRICANE SEASON, which is the end of December.
 
I tried the FL Market Assistance Program,  and surprise I never heard anything from them when I signed up online and the lines were always busy when I tried calling, I had to call back because they would disconnect you. Hurricane season not only hurt insurance companies, which have been making millions over the years, but the people who struggle to live in Florida everyday. Insurance companies have been collecting all this money for all these years for emergencies just like these but when one happens they aren't prepared - Oh my gosh, there's no money. Hhmmmm, wonder where all that money that people have been paying all these years went? The Presidents and CEO's of all these insurance companies became rich on who? Oh yeah, the policy holders, how could I forget.
 
This insurance a joke and something needs to be done. CFO Tom Gallagher won't be getting my vote for governor unless something is done about the insurance issues in Florida and I will be sure to let everyone that I know NOT to vote for him unless something is done.

Dear Governor - Your office needs to take the lead and firmly push for homeowners insurance regulation before this crisis ruins us.   Working families can't continue to absorb the outrageous insurance rate increases we have had to endure; I can't imagine residents on an fixed income deciding to eat or pay their insurance premiums.  We are quickly reaching critical mass...and we are beginning the slippery slope downwards.   Once the housing industry, which has been a leading economic force driving this state's economy, starts to sputter...watch out;  I have already heard the warning signs.  Families like ours are going to be forced out, investors and seasonal people will think twice about coming here and my retirement years will probably be been in a nearby state.  We will be taking our buying power with us, and the educated youth, which we have worked so hard to retain here, will leave as well.
 
The time for talk is over.  We need decisive leadership now!  The voters will be watching and keeping notes.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Governor Bush,   
 
It is so unlike you not to respond to a request for help or send the request to someone else for a response.  Since I have heard from no one, I am resending the Email of 14 June and including two recent FL TODAY "Opinions" pointing out the dire need we have in Brevard.  
 
The new emphasis by the Department of Children and Families on Recovery and Resiliency is a wonderful idea but DIAGNOSIS AND STABILIZATION has to the FIRST PRIORITY.  
 
Best regards,

Subject: HELP Needed in Brevard for CRISIS BEDS/SRT

Dear Governor Bush,  

In August 2001, Trish Wimmer and I appeared before the Brevard County Board of County Commissioners to ask for a "crisis prevention program" for Brevard County after the death IN JAIL of her Son, Rob Ferris.  The Brevard County Commissioners sent you a video-taped copy of our presentation and established a Commission on Mental Health and Community Solutions.  Much has been accomplished by the Commission over the past four plus years but we are virtually at a standstill at this point without funding for proper treatment for the multitude of severely mentally ill people that we have in Brevard County.   

The below (in red) is a part of my report for the NAMI - Space Coast, Inc., Newsletter which will be published Thursday.  The report goes to NAMI members, advocates, Brevard County Commissioners, our Brevard County Legislative Delegation Members, Brevard Judges, Hospitals, Public Safety, Sheriff, etc.   

Crisis Stabilization Units Update: As of 8 AM today, 12 June 2006, Circles of Care, Inc., had 32 people waiting for a Crisis Bed. Wuesthoff Behavioral Health had 1 waiting. Circles’ bed capacity is 52 and there were 56 people there at 8AM. Of the 56 people in Circles‘ Crisis Units today, 18 of them are awaiting transfer to long-term care. Wuesthoff has 0 people waiting for transfer to Northeast Florida State Hospital (NEFSH). The Past Month “Worst Case Scenario” (greatest number of people waiting to be admitted to a Crisis Bed) was 32 for Circles and 6 for Wuesthoff. The average wait in Brevard Emergency Rooms is 28-30 hours. Although I do not get formal reports of individual “wait times,” I was told by a hospital “sitter” that one man waited for 6 days for a Crisis bed and 2 women waited for 3 days! We need HELP in Brevard County. 

Area Hospitals are having to hire 24/7 “sitters” for people with mental health crisis situations until a Crisis Bed is located. This is not a good situation for either the Hospital or the person in a mental health crisis. Brevard County desperately needs more crisis beds.  We have begged for 16 Short-term Residential Treatment (SRT) beds for FIVE YEARS NOW (that I have personally been involved with).   Hospitals in Brevard and Circles of Care are all reporting to DCF D7 the status of lack of Crisis Beds in Brevard by phone and via written reports. Despite the efforts of our Legislative Delegation for funds to staff  a 16-bed SRT for Brevard County again this year, no funding was approved.   My understanding is that inclusion in the budget for the SRT for Brevard was denied because the SRT would be "recurring funds."

We ARE in Crisis here.  People are in Jail because of the ripple down effect of lack of Crisis Beds (my own Son included).  I have Emailed you on occasion over the years and you have responded.  It is my hope that this Email is one that you will read and SEND HELP to Brevard.

Thank you for your interest.

Best regards.

FLORIDA TODAY Readers 

More beds essential for mental-illness crises

The June newsletter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness-Space Coast reported that on June 14, 32 people were waiting for a crisis bed at either Circles of Care, Melbourne, or Wuesthoff Hospital, Rockledge.

They are the only two places in Brevard County with beds for those people with mental illnesses who need immediate care and have no place else to go.

Their average wait in a Brevard emergency room is 28 to 30 hours but can be much longer. Those waiting must have "sitters" with them, 24 hours a day, every day.

When those in need finally get a bed, they are discharged when they are "no longer a threat," instead of being kept there safe until stabilized.

Many in crisis are treated via hospital emergency rooms, or worse, held in jails. The dollar cost must be staggering.

The emotional toll is unimaginable.

Circles of Care has committed to build a 16-bed short-term residential treatment facility in Brevard County, at its own expense, when funds for staffing are received from the state.

To make it happen, Brevard County's legislative delegation, county commissioners and hospital administrators need to communicate Brevard's immediate and pressing need to the officials of District 7, which includes Brevard County.

Mentally ill need more long-term local care

Mary Previti's July 10 letter to the editor correctly portrayed the mushrooming problem of lack of available treatment for people in mental health crises in Brevard County.

For example, there were 25 people waiting in area hospitals for a crisis bed on July 10, and 30 on July 11.

Some crisis center clients do not recognize their illness and demand immediate discharge. Others realize how ill they are and want treatment but are discharged because they are compliant -- eating, taking the prescribed medications, going to therapy.

Because Brevard has no long-term care facility, they're released because people deemed dangerous to themselves or others need the beds.

The pain these clients experience is horrific: paranoia, auditory and/or visual hallucinations, delusions, fear and confusion.

Many are unable to care for themselves, stop taking their prescribed medications, suffer hopelessness, abuse substances, and end up homeless, in jail, or dead.

It is so wrong to allow people to suffer needlessly. As first vice president of the National Association for the Mentally Ill -- Space Coast, I ask, what is the price of a life?

Do we pay now or do we pay later?

Dear Governor Bush, I have heard on the news that you are helping the homeowners in Tampa to get their unreasonably high property taxes lowered. I'm asking you to do the same for Polk County homeowners. I bought my home last year (2005) the property tax was $927.83 with homestead exemption. This year homesteaded, my tax will be $1917.95 minimum. One tax clerk said it may be as high as $2200.00. I think something is very wrong here, My house is less than 1400 sq.ft., 20 years old and in a neighborhood with no sidewalks and no street lights. My neighbors don't pay this much and most of their homes are larger than mine. My income is limited to a small pension and these kind of taxes make it very difficult to pay bills, buy insurance and groceries. Anything you can do will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. Yours truly, Margie Ortiz, 3513 Dale St., Lakeland, FL 33812

Good afternoon Governor. My name is Bill Allman. I am the Program Manager of a
Veteran's Program in Washington State that is providing a valuable service
to Medicaid veterans and their families. In addition to saving State
Medicaid dollars, it places Medicaid veterans and their families with the
veteran related benefits for which they are entitled. Our program was
selected as a "Best Practice" by the NGA (National Governor's Association)
as well as earning the State of Washington's 2004 Governor's Award for
Customer Service.

I feel that by garnering visibility, through our continuous outreach efforts, perhaps many

more veterans and their family members will become familiarized with our efforts and

utilize us as a resource. I'm attaching some information to provide you with an overview of
our program. 

One important benefit our program provides is often overlooked by clients
and/or their representatives. As you may be aware, families/estates of
veterans, as well as all Medicaid recipients receiving long term care
services, are responsible to repay the state for all of the Medicaid
services associated with LTC. This is usually facilitated through the
state's Estate Recovery process. While our program saves Medicaid dollars
and places Medicaid veterans with the benefits they are eligible for, we are
also reducing the debt that families and estates of Medicaid veterans would
otherwise have to repay. In many cases, the veteran clients and their
families are not aware that they are eligible for VA related benefits.
Additionally, there are even more that overlook the requirement to repay the
state for LTC related Medicaid services. 


In addition to the veterans, our program targets the spouses and dependents
that are also eligible for benefits. In the past year (FY 2005), our program
saved $4.3 million dollars. With access to the VA and Department of Defense
data for all of our Medicaid clients through our membership with PARIS
(Public Assistance Reporting Information System), we have the ability to
continuously identify the veterans, spouses and dependents that are eligible
for VA related medical benefits. We recently found that many of the clients
we have targeted were not only eligible for medical benefits, they were also
eligible to receive increased monthly cash benefits. The VA authorizes
increased Aid and Attendance benefits as well as Improved Pensions for those
that require a third party to care for them (in many cases that would be the
nursing or assisted living facilities). 

By providing visibility to this program, you will assist our outreach
efforts that we're confident will save skyrocketing Medicaid dollars, as
well as the opportunity to facilitate access to VA related benefits for the
many veterans, spouses and dependents who are entitled to them.  

 

There are many states that are replicating our efforts and I'm sure that there would

be many more if there were more awareness and outreach. In the meantime, our

efforts are concentrated on our 600,000+ Washington State veterans and their dependents. 

 

Feel free to call or e-mail any questions or comments that you may have.

      Dear Governor Bush:
 
     As you know, many senior citizens who live in Florida live in manufactured homes and to obtain home owners insurance is an experience to behold.
    
    In 1987 I purchased a manufactured home and sold it to my daughter and her husband in 1994.  I had home owners insurance on the home with a yearly premium of about $425. I purchased a piece of land and built a CBS home on it. The premium was approximately $625 for a home that was valued at $200,000. I moved into the home that I am presently living in which is located in a senior retirement community. My home owners premium cost me $475 when I moved into the  manufactured home located in Cocoa. 
 
    I received a termination notice for my policy in 2004 that I would not be covered in 2005. I was fortunate to find an insurance company that would insure me in 2005. However, early this year I received a notice that my policy would not be renewed and will be terminated  August 15, 2006.
 
    Now the fun begins. You call insurance company after company and they can place a person with the State of  Florida company called Citizens. The premium is approximately $2000 per year and the functional operational history has been horrible based on last years experience. Last week there was a front page article in  the Florida Today newspaper about this very thing I am talking about  Many retirees are being hurt and nothing is be done about it except to let it ride. 
 
    You would think that the state government would step in and confront the insurance companies to force them to develop a plan where by all the insurance companies contribute to a hurricane pot to assist in premium payments. I notice that the insurance companies are not going bankrupt but the poor retiree is taking the hit. With the Florida primaries coming up. you would think the candidates would make this a primary issue but I haven't seen anything to that end.  
 
    One point I want to make also is that insurance can be obtained in certain counties but not others. This to me is bias and criminal.   
 
    I hope you can help by getting more involved with the senior citizens plight.. For my wife and I, we are considering moving to Tennessee I would like to stay in Florida, be eventually only the rich will be able to remain there. I hope you can develop a plan whereby all people of Florida can be satisfied.
    Thank you---

Subject:	[*] INSURANCE CRISIS-YOU WANT IDEAS, HERE ARE SOME IDEAS

10 POINT PLAN FOR FLORIDA INSURANCE COST RELIEF

	
1.	Tourist tolls come into Florida on all major roads of $1
2.	Re-arrange the homeowners exemption to the second $25,000 tier to insure all residents are paying for services and use those new tax dollars towards insurance costs.
3.	Add tax on all hotels, car rentals, and liquor; smoke items, gambling revenues, etc.
4.	Re-arrange the lottery revenue. All school districts do not use the lottery money for add on support but take revenues away after lotto dollars come forth.
5.	Start a new insurance lottery game.
6.	Additional sale tax of ¼%
7.	State plan for low cost loans or credits to improve older homes to modernize up to hurricane codes.
8.	Put additional pressure on insurance companies to keep costs down. They should average costs on all their product lines vs. expenses.
9.	Sell secondary insurance policies to private insurance companies backed up by revenues collected from above suggestions.
10.	State owned casinos.

If the State Of Florida does not react homeowners will not be able to sell or afford their homes. A great exodus will occur because Florida seniors are on fixed income and for those working the salaries have not kept up with housing costs. Many homeowners are now paying more for insurance than their mortgage payment.

Mr Bush please read and do something
 

My homeowners’ insurance has just been cancelled. I expected it. It’s been months & our state government hasn’t even thought of helping residents with the insurance crisis. 
It’s my firm belief that if Florida will tell insurance companies that if they want to sell insurance in our state (health, car, life) they must provide affordable homwowner’s insurance. At this time the insurance companies are dictating to us what they want. It’s gotten out of hand. Either they provide all types of insurance in our state or none at all. 
Florida is a large state & the insurance are making plenty of gravy with the easy policies. 
We need help immediately!! 

 

We are totally caught in the middle can’t get insurance and can’t sell because the new owner wouldn’t be able to get insurance.. This is awful. Many people in this area and Florida in general are at a very high risk of losing homes.... Something should be done..and soon. If we are lucky maybe we can keep the house until the end of the year maybe.. or a little longer if we can find a way to afford what the mortgage company will want to insure the dwelling ONLY!! 

The answer to the insurance problem is actually rather simple. Not all insurance companies write policies. This creates higher rates for those who do. Not all homes are covered either. This is also a problem. And the main problem...rates are outrageous. What can be done? 
1.Eliminate insurance companies from the picture. 
2.Create a much larger base of payees. 
3.Canvass more dollars to pay for damage. 
This can only be done by eliminating homeowners insurance so to speak and replace the premiums through taxation. 
This could be an extra gas tax, sales tax increase or some other tax form of revenue. This in turn would make everyone pay including the tourists. This also would free up property owners funds to spend in other areas. 

REQUIRE ALL AUTO INSURANCE CO. TO OFFER HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. INCREASE THE THE STATE SALES TAX .5 % CREATE A INSURANCE FUND FOR THE STATE TO PAY THE FIRST 10,000 DEDUCTABLE FOR SEVERE HURRICANE DAMAGE FOR EACH HOMEOWNER. HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE PREMINUMS SHOULD BE LIKE SAVE THE HOMES IN FLORIDA A 3% INCREASE LIMIT PER YEAR HOME OWNERS INSURANCE SHOULD BE BASED ON 5% OF YOUR ASSESED VALUE. 

 

This is my 2nd suggestion. We can use the state run program to provide wind insurance only.  The insurance companies would issue all their policies x-wind which would bring back most of the companies which have quit writing in Florida. The wind pool would be handled by the insurance companies doing business in Florida under the same formula that I mentioned in my original suggestion. Seems like a win-win situation! 

Florida has been a dream for my husband and I for so many years,now it is a nightmare.How in heavens name do these insurance companies expect people to pay these outrageous prices. 
We never made a claim on our home so now we are being penalized because of the hurricanes.We want(need) to sell but how can we with the insurance skyhigh. 
michael J Reddington made a good point,EITHER YOU WRITE IT ALL OR YOU DON"T WRITE ANYTHING AND YOU WON"T GOUGE THE PUBLIC EITHER.When hurricane Katrina did it’s deed last year we gave a nice donation to help out citizens of the United States,now we need the help too.Why don’t every state pay for the hurricane disasters,a little bit from everyone will be fair.Our insurance went up a little over 300% we were paying 1,400 
a year,now it went up to 5,000,State Farm wants 5,900.Something needs to be done and it needs to be done now. 

 

I feel that if a insurance company can sell homeowners insurance in other states and only picks and choose what they want to sell here in Florida (auto, etc.) that that insurance company SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SELL insurance in Florida, period.

I've written to you before and at times BLASTING you.
I'm a seasoned Realtor (33 yrs) and what is happening
to this homeowner's insurance is a CRISIS beyond
belief.   You have put a 15 member committee to see
what you can do but let me tell something...the 
insurance CEO's are laughing all the way to the BANK!!!
You can put a CAP on these premiums, some sort of
CAP that homeowner's can at least PAY without any
burden on their budget.  If mine goes beyond the
POINT OF NO RETURN I WILL DROP THE INSURANCE
AND JUST TAKE MY CHANCES.  I am talking about the
middle class, NOT THE RICH.  The rich can afford
anything.   The real estate is practically dead, but I tell
a potential seller if they want to sell, the price of their
property must come down.  The problems of HO's
insurance and the doubling or tripling of the real estate
taxes are the  PROBLEMS.
DO SOMETHING
You NEVER answer my emails!!!!!!!!!!!

Governor Bush,
 
I am writing in support of US Representative Ginny Brown-Waite's request for special legislative sessions to address the  home owners insurance crisis for Floridians. My home is insured by State Farm (I have been with them over 23 years). As you are probably aware, State Farm is seeking a substancial rate increase. Although a 4th generation native Floridian, between auto insurance and home owners rate increases my husband and I are seriously considering relocating to another state. 
 
Please consider Ms. Brown-Waite's request for special session. The public is desperately counting on you.
 
Good luck and Godspeed

Dear Mr. Bush
I have heard that you signed a bill that states a $715 million in insurance rate relief for Florida’s property owners and $250 million to help Floridians strengthen their homes to better withstand hurricanes. I own a home in Pasco County and my Insurance is dropping me saying that they are no longer issuing homeowners in Florida. I cannot afford for my mortgage to go up by $300 or more a month. If this bill is for homeowners how can I apply for it? Also I was wondering if there is a list of insurance company’s that are still issuing new policy’s for Florida? 
I had also heard that there was a bill in the making that if a Insurance company wants to offer auto or life insurance they would also must offer home owners insurance. I don’t think that it is fare that they will write the moneymaker insurance but refuse to write homeowners. I have heard that other states have this in law. I would like to see this here in Florida as well.  Due to higher homeowners Insurance cost rising it seams that Florida is no longer the place to live. 
If you are not the person to help with this new dilemma can you point me to who is?
Thank you for your time in this matter,

Subject:	special session

regarding homeowner's insurance. I keep being told that our representatives
are trying but not getting help in having a special session over the
homeowner insurance problem. I have been told they    "go home in disgust
because I can't do anything". Why is that? Why and who is preventing an
honest open review of something that is effecting many homeowners and
business owners? I do not comprehend why the three most powerful people in
this state have done NOTHING. Speaker Bense and Senate President Lee and you
have received emails from me today. I want to know why, as a citizen, a
voter, and a homeowner, that I feel no one is actually representing me. That
no one is actually representing any of the voters/citizens of this state. I
do not see anything happening, other than a rate increase granted to State
Farm. I see the public being told the OIR is displeased that we didn't come
to their meetings, which we did not know about, so how can one attend? Are
the meetings deliberately held without public announcement? Giving a "press
release" and "leaving it to the media" to tell the people? I always took
pride in casting my vote, of researching the issues the candidates put
forward, how they responded to issues I was concerned about, but, it seems
that once elected they only represent themselves or their interests.
Insurance rate doubling or tripling in two years will destroy some of us. I
think I will have to look to the Governor's Office and the State's
Legislature as the reason. Enhance Citizens, restructure it as an all
inclusive company, sell all types of insurance and NOT at a higher rate than
the other insurance companies, and let them leave the state. It is a sad day
when we see the government of Florida forsake the people they represent!

Subject:	comments, concerns for South Florida

Dear Govenor Bush,

My e-mail is not of critisizm or complaint, but most definitely of concern 
of the future of many citizens of FL, some of which have either left or made 
plans to leave their homes and this great state. My appologies for it's 
length, I certainly understand your time is precious and this is 1 of many 
that you receive. I feel however that it is time I should write.

9 years ago, I emigrated to the USA from England with my Wife having 
succeeding in winning the ARC Green Card Lottery allotment and we had 
decided to move to FL as oposed to one of the other 49, albeit that we did 
not and would not have considered about 20 of those (weather/opportunity/way 
of life).
Having started a new life here, my 2 children being born here (Miami and 
Pembroke Pines) and working for 1 large corporation all this time since 1997 
until just recently, we have really enjoyed and considered FL to be home. 
Also, in December 2005 I became a US Citizen. In April this year I joined 
with 4 friends and we started a new business. With all these great things 
happening, the friendships and overall settling achieved in FL have been a 
great success.

So, you maybe wandering where I am going with this.........
9 years Ago I bought and built a house in Pembroke Pines. Three years later 
we moved to a slightly larger house in Davie and three years ago, I moved to 
Plantation to a smaller house.
In each case of moving house, my Property Tax went up from $2500 to $5700 
and now to $8200, having gone from a Brand New House to older houses and 
this time a smaller one each time. Each Property bought at $259k then $337k 
and to $379k respectively. It has cost me more to downsize than to have 
stayed where I was, much like many other Floridians.

Also I went from having a huge choice of insurance companies to choose ref 
to homeowners, to about 5 in 2000 downt to only 2 in 2003. each time with 
more restrictions, less coverage and more expense. $1500 in the 1st house, 
$1800 in the 2nd to $3000 in my current. This is about to rise to $6000 next 
month with Citizens by default. I have never claimed. Incidentally, the 
older the house, the stronger and better built it is, yet the insurance 
companies claim that they will not insure anyhouse in South FL built before 
2002 and one or two rarely before 1998 because these concrete built and 
"Andrew" survived houses are too risky to insure.

Mortgages, Lines of Credit or any loan at a financial institution requires 
home owners insurance, yet they do not offer nor assist in the process of 
getting this insurance. We all pay for motor insurance so we can go to and 
from work, forget the leisure at this point. We all have various other 
insurances, Life, Health etc....

The scenario explains it better.
Line of credit for $100k - yearly payment - $18,000
Property Tax - yearly payment - $8,500
Homeowners Insurance - yearly payment - $6,000
Motor Insurance 1 average car - yearly payment - $750
Health Insurance - $7,000

The above totals - $40,250 per year.

Add to this FPL at $250 /mnth ave - Food and supplies at $400/mnth ave for 5 
people - Aftercare, since we all need to work at least 8 hours and travel an 
average or 2 hrs per day - $530/mnth for 3 kids - $13,000 for the year

This new total comes to $53,250 per year.

Therefore, my house needs to earn BEFORE tax, at least $80,000 per year. 
this is before even considering taking a vacation or having any $$ left over 
per month to actualy live and have fun.

With business' not paying salaries or giving increases more than 2 - 4% per 
year,and not every year either, It is becoming almost impossible for people 
to live in South Florida. In starting a business, the last thing I want or 
need to do is to take a large salary or even any salary, if I want to make 
the business grow and employ people. I have 4 partners and one full time 
paid employee so far.

The Mayor of Ft Lauderdale recently announced that "if anyone wants to live 
here in S.FL they should be prepared to work more than 40 hours a week and 
stop being lazy, and get a second job". This same Mayor has announced that 
he wants to increase property tax to bring in another $18m next year. This 
same mayor who only earns approx $38,000 per year, does not have to worry 
about his citizens plight, because his wife is a Circuit Court Judge who 
supports him and has a decent salary for what she does, so he does NOT have 
to get a second job.

It is clear that there is more of an incentive to only allow the Rich and 
Richly retired to live here again, like it was 20 years ago. Of course if 
this is the case, then Business will not have anyone to employ, since the 
rich do not work and everyone else can not afford to live here. If business 
can not grow/survive or employ, then the economy here in S.FL will fall 
dramatically.

Many friends and extended friends have already relocated out of FL to 
NC/SC/TN/GA/WA as they are unable to pay the cost of living and they do not 
get paid enough to stay and work here in S. FL. I know that unless things 
get better, I will shut down my business and be forced to sell my home and 
relocate out of state. If I can not pay the Line of credit homeowners 
insurance and property tax, then the home in which I own 70% equity could be 
foreclosed because I have no positive cashflow, only equity and increasing 
debt.

I applaud what you have done so far in office, but one thing you must do 
before your term is up, is to get this insurance problem sorted out This 
Year before it is too late, reduce the ever increasing Property Taxes, where 
the system is unfair and unjust (more tax to move into a smaller house). 
There needs to be a tax reduction of significant proportions.
Incentivate Floridians to stay. Keep business stimulated so that they can 
pay more for their employees and help Floridians stay and be able to afford 
their homes that will soon be defaulted on due to increasing cost and debt.

While I can accept raises in costs/taxes at a controlled justified rate, I 
can not justify the raises that I like many others are having to face now. 
We work very hard, we have paid for what we have today and now we are being 
penalized.

Thank you for your time to read this, I hope that you may recognise that I 
am only one of many Floridians affected, one that can write of even knows 
where to write to, has the time or even the belief that this will be read 
and not a waste of time.

Sincerely,

Barclay Quatremain.

Is this a fact? and if so, who can I contact to inspect my premises as I need to get hurricane windows and a hurricane door for my condominium

Governor Jeb Bush
Office of the Governor
PL 05 The Capitol, 400 South Monroe Stre
Tallahassee, FL 32399

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you to urge you to support improvements to our
state licensing regulations for child care providers. I am
concerned that our state does not do enough to ensure that
children in child care are safe and learning.

Across the nation, nearly 12 million children under age 5 are
cared for each week in some type of child care setting. Many
parents don't have a choice; they must work to support their
family, so child care is a necessity. Research shows early
childhood experiences influence later school success, so it is
very important that care is of high quality.

As you may know, the National Association of Child Care Resource
and Referral Agencies recently undertook a national poll of
parents with young children specifically focused on child care.
The results of this poll found that the majority of parents want
their children to be safe and learning while in child care.
Parents logically assume that child care programs are regulated
to ensure child safety and educational value, but in reality
this is not always the case. Licensing regulations vary widely
by type of facility and by state. We need to strengthen our
licensing regulations to ensure that all children are receiving
adequate care. 

By requiring all caregivers to have training in child
development and conducting regular unannounced inspections, we
can ensure that children are having educational experiences in
safe environments. I urge you to support improvements to our
state licensing regulations for child care facilities to enhance
the quality of child care in our state. Please keep me informed
about your work on this issue.

I have added this year’s progress report to the attached publications.

 

The Florida Interprogram Task Force is continuing implementation of Florida’s State Plan for the Prevention of Child abuse, abandonment, and Neglect: July 2005 through June 2010 so that they can turn over a living plan and process to the Office of Child Abuse Prevention when it is established.

Subject: Governor's Office of Child Abuse Prevention

 

I am writing regarding the establishment of the Governor’s Office of Child Abuse Prevention.  The passage of HB 7173 elevates the significance of child abuse prevention to a new level.  Potentially, this new office can have a big effect on child well-being in our state.

 

Currently there is a great deal of momentum, both on a statewide and a local level, surrounding implementation of child abuse prevention efforts.  To maintain that momentum, it is important that individuals involved in these efforts perceive that their continued efforts are important.  For instance, the Florida Interprogram Task Force, the authors of Florida’s State Plan for the Prevention of Child Abuse, Abandonment, and Neglect: July 2005 through June 2010, has unanimously decided that they will continue their implementation efforts until they have the opportunity to turn maltreatment prevention coordination over to the new Office.  The groundswell behind plan implementation was very evident at the recent “Together We Have What It Takes” conference in Orlando.  A presentation about Florida’s planning and implementation efforts was attended by a standing-room-only crowd of enthusiastic supporters.  In addition, the Task Force was selected, through a competitive process, to participate in the PREVENT Institute at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control).

 

Throughout the two years of the Task Force’s existence the Chiles Center of the University of South Florida has facilitated its planning and implementation efforts.  Facilitation includes planning, facilitating and documenting meetings; drafting reports; planning and delivering training; and providing technical assistance.  We recognize that, although the specific details of the prevention plan that emerges from the new Office may differ somewhat from the current prevention plan, the ultimate desired outcomes will remain the same: reducing initial incidences of child maltreatment through a variety of primary prevention efforts and reducing the likelihood of re-abuse.

 

I am writing to both of you to make a dual proposal.

*	First, to continue the current momentum and to ease the transition for the new Office, I am requesting that, until the Office of Child Abuse Prevention is established, some of the budget dollars allocated to the Office be used to support the continued activities of the Florida Interprogram Task Force.
*	Second, I am committed to promoting well-being for Florida’s children and have experience in they type of coordination that will be required to make the Governor’s Office of Child Abuse Prevention a success.  It would be an honor for you to consider me for the position of Director of this new office (see attached resume).  

 

In case you are not familiar with the prevention plan, I have attached a PDF version of the full plan and the Executive Summary.  The 2006 progress report will be available before the end of this month.

 

I would be happy to speak to either of you about this proposal at your earliest convenience.  I will be unavailable during the first half of July but, during the time I am away, you can contact Julie Helter at 850-488-4768 to set up an appointment.

 

Thank you for considering this proposal.

Mr. Bush:
Southwest Florida is experiencing traumatic financial difficulties due to the insurance 
crisis caused by the inability of commercial property owners to purchase 
insurance .  Insurance companies who are willing to insure are charging premiums 
greater than 100% higher than premiums of just a year ago.  
 
Many commercial lease agreement provide for the Tenant to pay the property 
insurance. Most Tenants are saying they can not afford  to do so and will default 
on their lease agreements.  
 
We are hearing of and seeing businesses who are leaving the state and saying 
they no longer can afford to live and do business in the area.  This will have a serious effect 
on our economy!
 
Please make an effort to do something about this situation.

Dear Governor, 
I write to you regarding the outdated Family Court
System in Florida that enslaves one ex-spouse to the
other by awarding permanent alimony. The day has come
to end this type of welfare system. My ex wife has no
incentive to become more productive in society (or at
least in a legitimate tax paying way). She would be
more inclined not to work, or to make money off the
books to keep her income low. However, if I get any
promotions I can be hauled back into court to give her
more money. Also, I could not decide to change careers
for something that might be more fulfilling but makes
less money because of the permanent obligation put
upon me by the court. As painful as divorce is, one
wants to get on with their life without the other
person, but lifetime alimony permanently shackles you
to the other person. I divorced my wife because I felt
there was no partnership in maintaining our economic
condition. She unfortunately was lazy and worked less
and less the farther I progressed in my career. I do
not understand how her lazyiness gets her a permanent
paycheck from me every month for the rest of our
lives. I understand other states, like Texas, have a 3
year limit on alimony. Florida needs to consider such
legislation. I completely agree with the motto on the
Repubublican Party of Florida home page:
“Good government is based upon the individual and that
each person's ability, dignity, freedom, and
responsibility must be honored and recognized.”  My
financial freedom from my ex-spouse needs to be
recognized and honored by ending my welfare payment to
her, and my ex-spouse needs to show some
responsibility so she can get some dignity.

Dear Governor Bush,
Enclosed is a letter to the St. Lucie County Tax Appraiser.   It shows
the discrepancy in taxing regardless of homestead exemption or not. Our
house is a single story structure and our neighbor next door is two
stories and yet we paid much more tax than they did. Please see the
attachments also.  Please review this and I hope you can make some
adjustments for this past year and in the future.  Thank you very much.

RE: Ludicrous Taxes For Americans, But Especially Floridians
Dear Mr. Furst,
I know that you have been getting a lot of complaints about the increase
in taxes for the 2005 year.
However, our particular case really illustrates the disregard for
citizens of this state. Our tax increase was $1,720.11 from $3619.95 for
the year 2004 to $5340.06 for 2005. The amazing thing is that there was
no structrure on this property for that tax period. We didn't take
occupancy of our new house until July 18, 2005. Another point is that
this is a single story dwelling with a floor plan of 673 square feet. Our
neighbor to the East has a two story house with 1,444 square feet, more
than double that of ours. Their tax was $3597.02 for 2005. I know that
they have homestead exemption, plus other exemptions totaling $40,000,
but they had a two story liveable house as opposed to our vacant lot. The
cost of a Caddilac Elderado is certainly more than a Volkswagon Bug.
Therefore, can you explain the high taxes on our property to me? 
We were working in Miami when we bought this propery in 1976. It was like
a get-a-way from the big city and something to work toward for
retirement. We moved to North Florida, but I became disabled and needed
to be in a warmer climate for the winter, for the same reason many other
Americans that come down from the North. Our children and grandchildren
still live in the area and we use this place to stay and see them.
Most of the folks here were average working people. We both had an income
and could afford the credit union payments to buy the land, a small
trailer and keep up with the condo fees. The taxes increased as expected,
but we had a chance to improve our skills and also received raises in our
wages enabling us to be able to afford to pay the increase in taxes. I'm
a retired Florida teacher, so you know I'm not some big entrepreneur. Our
tax bill for St. Lucie County had gone up almost 48% this past year. Our
cost of living (COLA) increase from our retirement sources has gone up
about 3%, not nearly enough to pay the tax with ease. This last tax
increase of 2005 has financially strapped many folks living in this
community. I have heard of several widows that can not afford to pay the
increase in taxes and are unable to sell because the tax is so high.
What is to happen to them?
As the tax appraiser for St. Lucie County, you should be able to do
something to help people. I hope this letter doesn't fall on deaf ears
and that I receive a reply from you. Thank you very much,
Best regards,

Subject:	Sales tax holiday - school supplies 2006

Dear Governor Bush,

While I applaud the passed legislation implementing a sales tax holiday on school supplies for 2006, I feel compelled to communicate my confusion on items that qualify and items that do not. When I completed shopping for school supplies today, I noticed there was a small amount of sales tax on the receipt.  When I asked the clerk for an explanation, she informed me that markers/highlighters are not approved items and then proceeded to give me examples of clothing items that were not essential for educational purposes but were allowed.  To my dismay and disappointment, when i checked the text version of the approved bill passed by our legislators, I discovered she was correct! Now I realize it is impossible to compile a "perfect" list of approved items , but it doesn't make sense to disallow markers/highlighters which are proven to assist the student and legislator in understanding/organizing critical information in complex reading assignments and allow clothing items such as bows, berets, and even lingerie! 

Sincerely,

David P. Develle

P.S. You might want to inform our legislators that school books (new or used, text or otherwise) haven't sold for less than $50 since  1970

HELP!  My husband and I are both well paid lawyers in Miami, we have just placed our house, that we love, up for sale due to the crushing expense of insuring this 1800 square foot house (no pool, no dog, no flood zone, and the insurance is over 7K per year), as are our taxes. Maybe if the property taxes weren't killing us, it would help us pay the insurance.

I have lived in Fla since I was 5 I am now 48, I do not want to leave. All of my friends are selling out and moving to other states because they can not afford to live here anymore. Who will be left? I have an idea that would help keep working people in Fla and an incentive for people to move here, and possilbe keep big companys form leaving, example Chris-Craft in Bradenton is packing up and going to North Carolina.
Why not raise the homestead exemption to 200,000 this would give Florida working residents a break.
I brought my 1st house when I was 23 it was 25,000 then and still is. I think the exemption should go to match the raise in the home prices. Think about it makes sense

Importance:	High

Governor;
How would you respond to the following hypothetical ad? "Become a teacher - all you need to do is go to school for four years.  You will need to spend long hours studying and thousands of dollars. Near the end of your schooling, during the last semester, you will have to quit your present job and work for free with no benefits till graduation!"
 
Mr. Bush I am 53 years old and like many people I am not financially secure. Yet I am preparing to do my student teaching in January which requires me to definitely lose my benefits as I must quit my position as an ESE paraprofessional to do my student teaching. If possible I may be hired as a contract sub which means pay without benefits. Or another possibility is no pay or benefits while student teaching. 
 
I made no mention of the tuition cost as there are programs for tuition reimbursement or loan forgiveness. Nor have I mentioned that for all this sacrifice you get to earn less than the school admionistrative staff. How enticing is it to know that you have to work for free and have no benefits? How many positions do you know of that you get to work for free without benefits?
 
Thank you for the programs that are in place, but as one member of a group of students who will be doing their student teaching this coming spring the satudent teaching process needs to be overhauled. I am part of a group of students in Bay county who will be graduating from UWF in May 2007 with a degree in ESE/Elementary Education (if we survive student teaching).
 
In order to increase the incentive for people to become teachers this archaic rule needs to be abolished. An intermediate program with an appropriate pay scale with benefits needs to be in place in the educational system. For those already in the educational system a method of transition should also be in place so that there is no loss of tenure, pay and benefits.
 
We, the students of UWF in Bay county, are "Highly Qualified" as we have all passed our certification exams and at present time are only lacking 2 classes and a practicum prior to beginning our student teaching.
 
I thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.

Governor Bush:  I hope this e-mail finds you well.  As a teacher in 
Miami-Dade County, I want to personally thank you for the Sales Tax Holiday. 
  Many of my students are extremely poor and I believe the Sales Tax Holiday 
helps them obtain the uniforms and school supplies they need for the 
upcoming school year.  However, I think that the timing of the Sales Tax 
Holiday is a little off.  Given that many students do not know what their 
teachers will require them to buy in the way of school supplies until they 
actually get back into school, I believe the Sales Tax Holiday would be more 
effective if it were held just as classes resume in August.  The second week 
in August may be a better time to hold the Sales Tax Holiday.  Thank you for 
your time.

Speaker Allan G. Bense, Speaker

I have written previously and I have never received a direct communication 
from your offices.  The emails have just been passed on to the FDOE.  So I 
am writing again to let you know that the legislature needs to do more so 
that the FDOE can have better options.  I would like your offices to respond 
to me directly.  This is not just an FDOE issue.  It is a legislative issue.

Since February I have been trying to find a solution with the FDOE and 
general state government and I’m still left without a good solution.  My 
temporary certificate was issued when I worked at the virtual school 
Connections Academy.  I feel the state should have required them to have a 
professional competency program or that they should have been required to 
work with a local district so when I finished my year of teaching I would 
have met this requirement.

The FDOE has informed me that the two-year requirement is being changed to 
one-year of teaching but so far I don’t know if this will apply to me now, 
or not till next summer.  I’ve passed all the required tests and taken all 
the classes on my statement of eligibility so the second year of teaching 
and the professional competency program are all that stand in the way of my 
getting my professional certificate.  I have allergies that limited school 
options.  The newer schools that are good for my allergies have more 
competition so I tried to network by substituting at those schools.  I have 
252 in-school days as a substitute.  But my temporary expired on June 30 and 
under current laws I have to wait till July 1, 2007 to apply for a new 
temporary.  It is ridiculous that someone in my situation should have to 
wait a year for another temporary.  I was denied the opportunity to complete 
the professional competency program.  I have been ready to prove my 
competency.  I think getting A’s in all my classes and passing all the state 
tests are evidence that I know what I’m doing.

I’ve spent an excessive amount of time and energy trying to find a solution 
that is better than waiting a year.  After months of pursing this issue with 
the FDOE I was told about the EPI program.  I have been checking into it but 
there are a bunch of problems with this solution.  The biggest problem is 
that it requires me to take more classes and pay more money when I already 
took all the classes on my statement of eligibility.  There is no 
streamlined program.  I’m still trying to see if one local college can come 
up with a simplified program by accepting my other classes, but so far it 
looks like I’m still going to be in a situation that is very unfair to me.  
I should just be able to demonstrate my competencies without having to take 
more classes and pay more money since I completed the classes on my 
statement of eligibility.  But currently the FDOE says it has no legislative 
option to do this.  So I feel the legislature should fix that.

Anyone who has completed their classwork and state tests should immediately 
be able to renew their temporary for another 3 years so that they can get 
hired and complete the professional competency program with the school 
district.  Or the state should provide a free and convienent way that we can 
demonstrate competency in another way and get our professional certificates.

Donna Reynolds

I was glad to read that you have set up a committee to seek a solution to the property tax inequities.  I am an exception to the normal resident or snow bird, but like both I have a home where I live, protected by homestead and SOH, but we also have a retirement home in N. Florida that we built ourselves in 1988 where we had planned to retire.  The home where we now live will be sold next year and the new owners will be assessed up to the new value.  In the meanwhile our retirement home in the last few years has gone up in assessment value and raising our taxes over 500%.  Although there will be some relief when we again live there and have homestead on that house, the damage of rising assessments is already done.  My husbands retirement will be about 1/2 of what he now makes.  Paying the higher taxes so far are not a problem and hopefully when we sell the house we are in we will make enough to pay the extra taxes for a few extra years or else we will have to move to a more tax friendly state. I hope some help will come from your committee.  Thanks, Cheryl Myers

Jeb:
 
As Florida residents for the past 12 years, we have had our share of financial perils.  We have had tropical storm damages, hurricane damages, and now are facing the worst problem yet.  The INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY problem.  This could cause us, along with many other Florida residents, to pack up and head north or west where can afford to live.
 
In January of 2005 we closed on a new condo, Bayside, in Cape Canaveral, Florida.   At that time the maintenance fee was $250.00.  This month, July 2006, all residents, 101, of Bayside were given a special assessment of $1,850.00 each to cover the cost of Wind Insurance from Citizens Insurance.  The above figure of $1,850.00 is in addition to the $300.00 per month maintenance fee we still pay until the increase  to $500.00 per month takes effect Jan 1st, 2007.  In other words we have to pay $950.00 for August, $600.00 for the remaining months of this year.  Jeb, just how far is far enough?
 
Being retired and on a fixed income leaves very little choice for many of us.  Mortgage Companies require insurance or they will foreclose.  I expect this to happen to many Floridians.  Something needs to be done VERY QUICKLY to assist homeowners and make insurance affordable to all.

I have been a supporter of our Governor and believe it will be hard to find someone to fill his shoes.  I do have several issues:
I am a supporter of HR 818 The Federal Acupuncture Act which will add acupuncture treatment to Medicare and Government people.  Please consider this a request from a tax payer to consider this bill.
 
I am NOT a supporter of the way home insurance is being handled by Commissioner McCarty.  Being in real estate I have seen many elderly and first time home buyers being hit with their insurance payments double if not triple.  I have also witnessed a decrease in people moving to Florida because of this rising cost.  There must be some research being done, rather than increase prices 50, 70, 100%.  Does the Commissioner not realize that people will lose their homes and it is making the State of Florida not such an attractive place to live???

If you see these, these are people who are irresponsible with handling and shooting off fireworks. 
 
These people can also get hurt and killed. Consumer fireworks have been manufactured haphazardly.
 
If you want more evidence to ban fireworks, I got more for you.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush, 

 

As I am sure you recall, BOMA Florida was urging your veto of SB 142.  Please read the attached.  The very issues we were concerned about have come to fruition in full force.  As a real estate developer yourself, I’m sure you will appreciate the implications of what BellSouth is setting out to accomplish.  It is going to take a lot of work to undo what has been done.  I can only hope for the sake of private property rights and customer choice that BellSouth does not prevail.  If they do, Mandatory Access will be next.  I hope we can count on your support as we work to rectify this problem.

Subject:	Florida's  homeowners major issues!

Good morning Governor Bush,
 
              I am a concerned Floridian in regards to a couple of major issues. I would just like to share those with you. Perhaps, these can be taken into consideration a little more in depth, due to the impact they have an many of our lives. I am a Miami-Dade County Public School  1st Grade Teacher with a Master's Degree. I have been with the schools system for eight years now. My school has been a A school for three years now! Of course, that was not the case when I started there. Therefore, we work very hard despite of conditions and student teacher ratio(which was 27 for me). As a Graduate with seven of experience, my salary is still under $39,000 and I did not choose this career because of the money, but because I love to teach and be able to see the growth of knowledge of my students. This leads me to my next two issues property insurance costs and property taxes. I currently own a condo, but have conquered numerous condo issues, expenses and have outgrown the space. I know insurance rates are out of control, but as a state can't anything be done for us ? 
The property prices are very high and the taxes are a substantial amount that have to be paid every year. Again, what can be done for us?
These issues all correlate with the fact that everything increases, EXCEPT SALARIES. How can we continue?
 
On behalf of my family and myself I  truly thank you for listening. Have a good day.

Subject:	Citizens Monopoly causes Homeowners to move out of state

July 21, 2006
 
Dear Mr. Jeb Bush;
 
I would like to inform you about a problem I’m faced with that probably many homeowners in Florida will be faced with in the very near future.
 
A couple of days ago I received notice from our Condo Association that our development’s insurance through Citizens was being increased from $84,000 per year (for the past 3 years) to $320,000 for 2006/2007.  According to our Board of Directors, they only gave them 3 days notice.  As the association doesn’t have that kind of money laying around, each of the 100 homeowners within our development has to pay an assessment.  We have to pay the first special assessment of $650 per unit (in addition to our regular $300 HOA) by August 10th, 2006 (total of $950 for August).  Then the second assessment of $1200 will be spread out as $300 per unit for each month the remainder of the year making our HOA $600 per month.  THEN our HOA will remain at $500 for all of 2007.   And just to remind you that these increases are with 14 days notice!
 
Please allow me to explain my situation further.  We have lived in our development since it was built 4 years ago.  I am a stay-at-home mom with 3 years old twins.  The reason I stay-at-home with them is because daycare for twins is $300 per week, which would be the same as my take home pay.  I do work in the evenings for $7 per hour to earn some extra income.  But it’s hard going to bed at 3 am and being up with the kids at 6:30 am and then being a perky mom.
 
We bought our home for $190,000 4 years ago.  It is now valued at around $350,000 BUT the likelihood of actually being able to sell it in a market where there are about 800+ condos for sale in a 5 mile stretch are very slim.  NOW with the assessments and $500 future HOA fees it will probably be impossible to sell my house – even if I sold it for $190K!  We have talked about moving somewhere else nearby.  However, we can’t afford to.  If we were to buy a house for about $250,000 here locally, we would be lucky if we could find something that’s not in a very dangerous neighborhood.  The house would be at least 50 years old if not older and be smaller than what we live in now (which is only 1600 sq ft).  On top of that, although hopefully the mortgage payment would be a lot smaller than what we have now, because of the equity that hopefully we would get out of our existing home (in an ideal world), we would end up with the same house payment because of the increases in Home Owners Insurance and the ridiculously high taxes when buying a new house.  Our millage rate here locally is 2 mil.  
 
As I see it, the already shaky housing market is going to get even worse when people start listing their houses to try and bail out of Florida due to increases in insurance, HOA dues and taxes.  When people can’t sell their houses, and can’t make their payments, they’re going to end up foreclosing on their homes.  Is that what we want to have happen?
 
My husband and I have worked all our lives, to get to the point where we could have a home and raise a family.  Now that we’re finally there, due to circumstances beyond our control, we don’t know what we can do to keep a roof above our children’s heads!
 
The condo association apparently can’t even shop around to try and get different insurance coverage because Citizens is the ONLY company in Florida will write policies for high rise on barrier islands.  We don’t live in a high-rise condo, ours is a townhouse, however we all belong to the same association.  What happened to fair choice and eliminating monopolies?  How can this be allowed to happen?  
 
In addition to all of the above, my husband has been working on a CO2 Global Change project for the Smithsonian Institute (out of Washington) here at the Space Center for the past 11 years!  Now apparently the project is coming to an end in March 2007 because of lack of funding by the government because of all the money being used for the War.  He has a Bachelors in Biomechanical Engineering and a Masters in Project Engineering Management and can’t find a job anywhere locally because the job market/economy is so bad and nobody is hiring.  There aren’t any jobs out there unless you want to work for $6 per hour because those jobs are plentiful.  The reason why those jobs can’t get filled is because the people, who work for $6 per hour can’t afford to live here, rent or own a house.  And as most of them rent at that pay rate, they can leave the area whenever they feel like it.  Us as homeowners are stuck here!  I also hold a Bachelors in Business Studies and can’t even get hired to work for $6 per hour because I’m overqualified!  Employers know that you’re only working the job because you’re desperate and that you’re out of there as soon as something better comes along so they won’t even hire you.
 
What are we supposed to do?  Is there anything you can do about this crazy situation?  Thanks for listening.
 
Sincerely,
Pamela Johnson

Dear Mr. Bush:
 
 
I am writing to you to get your insight on the salaries the Department of Children and Families receive.  These employees are handling a very large case load.  They help the lowest social economic population.  They are pennies away from getting the same services they offer their clients.
 
Why are these State employees paid so very little?  In order to work in this field they are required to have a 4 year college degree.  However they are paid at the lowest level.  This is confusing to me.  I really need someone to explain it to us.
 
Do you have any plans for the Department of Children and Families?  Two years ago there was a large lay off.  Do you think this was wise?  My husband was one of the people who got laid off, however was rehired at a lower salary and lost his vacation time and now has to pay for his insurance.  Not to mention the service center was shut down and he is required to work out of town and travel 40 miles each way.  I don't need to tell you what the price of gas is doing to us.
 
Please look into this matter and get back with me.  We are a hard working family trying to raise a family and we are having a very difficult time.  If you have any openings in the Tallahassee area we would consider moving.
 
Thank you for your time.

Dear Jeb:
Four years ago my homeowners insurance premium was $642.  This year the STATE TAX alone on my premium is $351.  My total premium is $7878 (AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 12 TIMES).  Your man in charge of Insurance, Tom Gallagher is leaving the State property insurance  in shambles and expects get votes for another office???  What a joke!  Is there no longer such a thing as an INSURANCE COMMISSION?  There is no way that the risk is that high. 
What is your staff working on these days?

Subject:	Florida Homeowners Insurance

Dear Governor Bush,

As you are well aware, the home owners insurance huge rate increases are a major concern to my family as well as for all Brevard County residents.  Many retired couples are being forced to sell their homes because they can no longer afford to pay these high costs.  Our current State Farm homeowner's insurance costs $2800 per year.  With their proposed increase, we will potentially be paying almost $6,000.  This increase will place a significant strain on our family income.  The worst part is that many Floridians have never filed a claim because their damage has never exceeded the cost of their hurricane deductables.

We all must have home owners insurance.  Therefore, many of us have no choice but to pay the high price or leave our current residence.

However, I would like to propose an idea to you that would not only serve the residents in your district, but also be a wonderful re-election platform for my Republican party.  

Is it possible to petition for Congress to at least allow Florida residents to deduct all or part of this insurance from our Federal income tax as is with property taxes?  I believe this would provide some relief to all of us. Please consider this as a viable means to assist the people of the state of Florida.  Thank you for your consideration and your service to our county and state.  You will be greatly missed as Governor and we sure wish you could remain another 4 years!!

Subject:	Insurance Risk Assesment

Dear Mr. Bush,
   It has come to my attention Insurance companies who wish to conduct business in our great State of Florida - and by business I mean specifically "Collect Money from the residents (ie., constituents)", - with little to no risk on their part.  Viewing the situation from the consumer side of the issue:  I / We (hopefully) all citizens of Florida are obliged to and in some cases are bound by law, to purchase and maintain Insurance policies for a myriad of "What If's" that may and in 'most cases' never do happen.  Car; Life; Medical; Flood; Hurricane; Wind.... all "just in case something should happen".... Its nothing more than "Risk".  If I / We do not purchase Insurance Policies against to cover the "What If's", then we are choosing to take the risk of something happening which could potentially put us in the streets - homeless.  So, for the most part, we, as Floridians, like those who live all over this great Nation and in fact the World at large, make a decision on each of the potential "Risk" and choose to either role the dice and not "Insure" for our own peace of mind, or we pay a company, several actually, who for 99.9 % of the time, simply turn that money into their own capital gains in order to grow exponentially.  No one who has just half a brain is blind to the lavish extent with which Insurance companies treat themselves.  From huge beautiful office buildings that could easily outstate those found in any capital city in our land, over laden with management offices that rival the opulence and grandeur of Kings, spacious, comfortable, accommodations, Limousines, Mercedes Benz, Porches, Jaguars, Cadillac's and BMW's, all new and coming from some of the finest homes in America, covering the parking lots of these grand buildings, which are far beyond what the other 90% of Americans would call "Work" or our place of work and that house people who are so used to receiving tons of money for not actually doing "anything" to "earn" it, short of hiring heartless peons to pour over their policies looking for loopholes to get out of paying a teeny tiny bit of that un-earned money they are so used to sitting back and collecting "WITHOUT RISK", back to the people who actually do find themselves in a position where they need some of that money they have been pouring into these Insurance companies - THEIR ENTIRE LIVES!!!
   Mr. Bush, I implore you.  You seem, to me, to be a man who has a heart and a brain, despite coming from a wealthy background where neither are really necessary.  Clearly you decided, somewhere along your life's road, that there are people in this world that are not born with a silver spoon in their mouth and that it is those people who support the class structure but what sets you apart from those who would be in the same class as yourself, is your ability to "see" people who are clearly beneath your class, not just to recognize who is and who isn't but to see them and far more importantly, you can see through their eyes as they look up into the higher class structures, you have the ability to see through there eyes because you have chosen not to be hemmed in by those who are you equal in class.  Your not blind and you not ignorant and you choose not to be either.  Smug, patronizing, ignorant, self important people who have everything without having to do anything to get it, never earned it and will do 'anything' to keep anyone under them.... under them.  That's not who you.  I know it takes a vastly more elegant person to rise above those who are simply born above, those who take it and everyone for granted.  I understand the difference in class structure in our society and that money is not what determines which class a person is firmly a part of, the "pyramid principle" as sociologist call it and I can see you are one who has decided to be your own man.  Again I implore you... do not allow the Insurance companies, the people who run them, own them, get fat off of the insecurities of the general public, to come into Florida and squeeze us for more money.  We all know they "really" don't need it.  When one sits back and starts to figure just the average cost of a policy per household - even ten years ago - the figures are staggering, at least to one who understands them.  The Insurance companies only pay out on a sub-fraction of the policies they collect from.  I do not possess the facts to place a dollar amount on what the Insurance companies collect verses the dollar amount they pay out but I'm sure you have staff that can figure it out pretty closely.  We had a senses taken in Florida not so very long ago.  The numbers of households in this state should be easy enough to calculate and the average policy cost should be equally easy to obtain, simple multiplication will prove the only "real" reason Insurance companies want to increase their policy premiums, is to reduce the "risk" of not raking in a "long" ton (2,240 pounds) of money, instead they would only be raking in a "short" ton (2,000 pounds), never-the-less they will continue to rake in a ton of money, regardless of how many hurricanes hit Florida.  What I see this boiling down to, as a person who see's life for how it really is, any company that makes any money is ahead and any company that doesn't make any money is behind but Insurance companies charge money every year often never paying a dime out for decades and once in a blue moon they have to let a little bit of it slip away - 1 bad year in Insurance money terms, doesn't even put a dent in all the money they pulled in during all the good years - in short - they'll survive, barely feeling a nudge, even if we see a couple bad years here in Florida - they're just too used to getting all of our money and not having to pay any of it back, please, at least make them have to deal with a little portion of the "Risk" that they have been collecting from all of us, nearly all of our lives!!!  Thank you for your time.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor, State of Florida

Dear Governor Bush:

Thank you for appointing a panel to examine the inequities of Floridaâ€™s property taxes.  Thousands of people are affected by these inequities, and we know that many of the hundreds and hundreds of properties for sale in our city are partly the result of peopleâ€™s moving because they are unable to sustain high property taxes year after year.

My husband and I also are severely affected by property taxes.  We painfully watch tax assessments each year in our neighborhood, where the overwhelming value of property is vested in land, not structure.  Yet, under the Save Our Homes legislation, we pay close to $10,000 annually, while many of our neighbors pay $2,000 to $3000.  Unable to stand the annual drain on our retirement savings, we will be forced to leave the area as soon as our five-year residency ends.  

Thank you for looking into the matter of taxes, and I truly hope that a fair system of taxation can be established, with all taxpayers taxed at an equal rate, just as we all were created equal.  We do enjoy living in Southwest Florida.  

Yours truly,

Subject:	RE: FL Homeowner's Insurance Increases

Dear Gov. Bush: 
 
Just how much do you and our sorry excuse for a State Insurance Commissioner believe that the Florida  homeowner can take with these unjustified homeowners insurance rate hikes. These insurance companies have been allowed to re-structure their corporations and cook the books so that: 1) Their risk is not spead "nationwide," or "allstate," or "state farm." They created structured Florida corporations so they will always look broke! 2) Various published reports have appeared indicating the "non-made claims" on their balance sheets erroneously pump up their "losses" in order to justify these huge increases.
 
Florida has been a vibrant state and is evidently seen by the insurance industry as one big golden goose laying golden eggs.  For all their whining, they are still making huge corporate profits! 
 
You know if we had to pay "protection money" to some illegal gang, at least we would get "protection."  Now after paying decades of premiums with no claims, we are shaken down until we can no longer afford our own homes!  If that is not unjust enrichment, I don't know what is. Just who runs this state?  Has ANYONE considered what this situation is doing to homeowners, the elderly, the real estate market, real estate prices/sales, foreclosures, tax revenues, bankruptcies, inducing new industries to locate in Florida, and on and on?  Evidently selling out to the never satisfied insurance industry is all anyone in Tallahassee is considering.
 
The truth is these companies want out of the insurance business that actually created them into these monoliths and morph into "financial consultants."  How is the state of Florida going to handle it when folks cannot afford homeowners insurance and go "naked?" Already our deductibles are tremendous (greatly mitigating their responsibility) and litigation will no doubt be required on the honeowners' part to get the insurance weazels to pay up anyway!  This day is right around the corner. If these companies want to write any lines or do any business (auto, life, health, etc) in this state, then they need to put all their "risk apples" in one basket and run as one company, not basically "red line" Florida. Why isn't Florida tougher on these insurance companies?
 
From reading the newspaper it appears that all Tallahassee does is crumble at every demand made by every insurer.  I am a 7th generation native Floridian.  When I can sell my modest home, I am out of this state my family literally built.
 
Sincerely, 
Peyton Parker Williams

 There is grant monies for such parks and it could be a dream come true for al the generations to come if it was not for a County commissioner that thinks we are  all poor and not worthy of his time Michael Francis stated in a commission meeting  we were all broke and didn't farm and the land was dirt cheap . It seems he is against  buying a piece of property that is the idea place to build a good and long lasting sports complex  for all of the county to be proud of. I further state if it had been in his area he would be crying the loudest to get it  done. 
  A history of the part were our leaders of tomorrow are playing on and have for many years  was a county dump back in the 40s to mid 70s and any and every thing was placed in the site .Being a farming community   waste pesticides including ddt and other deadly poisons are  buried just a few inches below  our feet . 
  When it rains the place floods and the ground water smell bad  and got to be contaminated ,I ask would you want your children and grand children playing on such a place  I would say no.
    I am sure in some small way you can find it in your heart to maybe speak on our behalf to speed this park into action  and get the land acquired   the place is just across from the elementary school that is  running out of play grounds fast and could be even utilized is such fashion there could be used as out door  learning facilities  and other such learning experiences , plus it is a clean and pesticide free place .
   You may ask how I know this  I have lived here for 57 years all of my life and the parcel in question was farm land  yes pesticides were used but not in any quantity and allowed to go into pasture for 20 years or more yes I did carry pesticides to the dump as did most every one around here it was a expectable -practice back then.
   Much thanks for reading and may god bless

Mr. Bush, please take the time to read this E-Mail!

 

Hello Commissioner Winn,

 

I am a veteran teacher of 23 years five of which have been at Evans High School.  I came to the school to reestablish a computer graphics program.  The class was not taught for 2-3 years.  

 

We have been through many changes over the past several years starting with Dr. Lawson cleaning house of many individuals just not wanting to be in a school environment for more than making problems.  Some of these processes take time. Our school today has clear halls and polite students.

 

 Mrs. Karen Wilson has made a tremendous effort to provide programs not only for the students, but for the teachers to better equip them for all challenges in teaching.  She has been present to the individual needs of many showing a genuine love and concern for our students and faculty.  We missed the mark of a D or better, BUT HAVE YOU CHECKED OUR LEARNING GAINS?  WOW! students that didn't think they could write are composing beautiful paragraphs and putting their thoughts down on paper in an organized manner.  We didn't reach them all, but we did move forward.  Many have poor educational foundations due to a multitude of factors which results in poor performance on the FCAT or many standardized tests.  Many of these students succeed, though, by the time they graduate.  

 

Mrs. Wilson has SUCCESS intended for everyone of our students.  It takes time to implement new procedures and see if they are successful.  PLEASE HELP US KEEP A PRINCIPAL WHO CARES SO MUCH FOR THE STUDENTS AND FACULTY.  Give us another year to prove that we can make the mark.  

 

Sincerely,

Mrs. Katherine Gilmartin

Dear Governor John Ellis Bush:	
 	
I represent one of thousands of Floridians who understands the real impact to my community of untreated mental illness. Far too many people in our communities affected by serious mental illness continue to live without access to treatments and support services so critical to recovery. Access to mental health medications for people with serious mental illness in Medicaid is critical to the health, economy, and well being of our communities. Cutting vital mental health treatment and services may appear to save a dollar today, but the cost tomorrow in lives and costs in resources by police, the courts, hospitals, educators, and business will be far greater. Overturning a person’s right to effective medications in Medicaid through disastrous cuts in the budget will mean local costs in courts, hospitals, jails, and schools will increase. My community should not suffer the cost of a bad budget decision by the governor and legislators. As a citizen of Florida, I understand that the governor and you, with the legislature, have TOUGH DECISIONS to make to balance the state budget. I urge you to make SMART CHOICES and protect access to mental health medications in Medicaid for our communities and our families. Please fix the budget…protect access to necessary medications for people with mental illness by choosing to budget wisely.

 Gov Bush,
I am very concerned about all the Utility Companies and Insurance Companies (State Farm)
rate hikes we are being hit with. I am aware of all the hurricane claims! But, I am also aware that we need support from you and your office on putting a cap on some of these outrageous hikes. Todays paper in the Naples Daily News 7/20/2006 "OUCH! State Farm raises rates 90 percent"  yesterdays paper said,
"State Farm raises rates 50%"??? Okay which one is it? State Farm, is way out of control and FPL!
 
Who can afford to live here? Only the wealthy? I am sure you are really not affected by what I am
saying, because you have to experience the Insurance & Utility hikes and low wages in Florida.
 So, I work all week and at the end of the week, I have a negative balance instaed of a postive.
 
I work 60-to 65 hour a week and my husband works 45-50 hrs a week, so its not about working
it is about these Companies that are out of control that you need to get a handle on.
That is why we voted for you. So, please do something about these rate hikes, not just talk
about it on TV. Action speak louder than words!
 
Or give us a job transfer back to our HomeState.

Hi, My name is James Moltmann BM3 USN Ret.
I contacted the FWC to find out about a boat I found abandoned on a Tampa
waterway. The local office couldn't help me find out about the boat. They
asked me to call your 888-404-3922. The woman on the phone did not know
about abandon vessels. Now I was asked to call the local FWC. Look the poor
boat needs help there is no anchor on it and it could cause a hazard to
navigation. If there is any thing you can do to fix this problem I would be
very grateful.


The boat is on the river near the boat ramp at Riverview Dr. and US. on the
far side of the bank. There are no Fl reg Numbers.

 Just a short word on the subject. If insurance companies continue to raise rates for coverage it will be very simple, only the very rich will be able to afford to live in the state.

Subject:	Property Tax Committee

Dear Gov. Bush,

	I was pleased to learn that you are appointing a
committee to review our state’s property taxes.  It is
important that we repeal the “Save Our Homes”
amendment, and I hope that the review of the laws by
your office and the legislature will be an important
first step towards achieving that goal.

	I have just graduated law school and will begin my
service as an Assistant State Attorney next month.  In
the past three years, the median price for a single
family home in our state has gone up 70%.  It has gone
up 105% in the past five years.  A single family home
in my hometown of Miami has gone up 149% in the same
time.  The combination of my $127,000 of student
loans, the relatively low pay provided to ASAs, and
the increase in housing prices has driven me to work
in Polk County.  From what I can tell, it is a fine
place to live with a great deal to be proud of, but I
have a limited knowledge of the area because I have
never lived less than 2 hours away from it.  I am
working there because they have some of the lowest
housing costs in the state and working in one of the
counties with the least expensive housing is the only
way I might be able to afford a home.  Even using the
resources provided by the state to first time home
buyers, it is not certain I will be able to afford a
modest home.  It is bad enough that after seven years
in universities I may not be able to work for the
state and afford a home in one of our least expensive
communities.  It is even worse that I will be punished
by paying a disproportionate amount of taxes because I
chose to get an education rather than going straight
into the job force after high school.  That is what
the “Save Our Homes” amendment means to me.  It is a
punishment for going to school.  It is a punishment
for being young.  It is a punishment for not coming
from a family rich enough to buy me a house when I got
out of high school.  

	For my father, “Save Our Homes” is something
different.  For my father it is a trap.  My father is
living in the same four bedroom house that he bought
in 1986 when he had just had his fourth child.  At the
time, I was the oldest and would be over a decade
until I graduated high school.  Now he is a year and a
half away from his youngest graduating from college. 
He no longer needs the big house.  After being laid
off from FPL several years ago, he does need the
money.  In another state, he could sell his big house,
move to a smaller house and invest the proceeds so
that he could afford to live on half the money he used
to make for FPL that he now earns as a bailiff.  In
our state, it makes less sense for him to do this.  In
our state he will be punished for having finished
raising his family.  If he moves now he will have to
pay more taxes on a smaller house worth less money
than the one he currently lives in.  

	You were instrumental in repealing the bullet train
amendment several years ago.  That was a bad law that
came from good intentions.  “Save Our Homes” is
another bad law that comes from good intentions. 
Repealing the amendment would not lead to an increase
in taxes.  Repealing the amendment would lead to a
fair distribution of taxes.  I believe the citizens of
our state are smart enough to recognize that our
governments have certain budgets that needs to be met.
 They will recognize that if everyone pays their fair
share, then everyone’s millage rate will go down. 
They will recognize that some individuals will have to
pay more and some will pay less in the immediate
future, but this is the fair course of action that
will benefit almost everyone as years go by.

	Thank you for the attention you are giving this
matter.  Please inform me if there is anyway I can be
of service regarding this issue.


Sincerely,

Daniel Wehking

Subject:	One Man Wrecking Team?

Governor Bush:
   I read where the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council has said that you must call a special session of the Legislature to try and breathe life back into Florida's collapsed home resale market. Yes, the market has already collapsed. It collapsed because of your stubborn failure to call such a session right after the scheduled session failed to pass the only viable answer to the property insurance mess.
   The State of Florida needs a State Catastrophe Property Insurance Program with a state wide single per $1,000 of insured value premium rate that will cover all forms of natural or terrorist catastrophes. Yes, the same per $1,000 of insured value premium rate throughout Florida is necessary to solve the problem. Area, or regional rates are a part of the present problem, and they fail to recognize that Florida is a long narrow state that even "inland areas" are not safe from hurricanes, or tsunamis, earthquakes, or terrorist acts.
   Some facts: Over 25% of Floridian's have dropped their homeowner's insurance protection; Foreclosures have doubled, and the exhorbitant premium rates are the fault; Home for sale listings are up about 400% while home resales have slowed to a trickle as for sale signs litter our lawns.
   If you fail to call the special session, you will be labeled "The One Man Wrecking Team", the Governor who couldn't handle the single major crisis he faced during his period in office, as Florida's economy continues on it's way into the tank with the real estate market.
   Sincerely, Michael Fitzpatrick,

Subject:	Property Taxes

Importance:	High

Good evening, Governor.  I am concerned about the assessed values of property, as I own vacant land that I purchased in 1997/1998.  My plans are to build, but last year, my assessed value doubled, resulting in its taxes doubling.  This year, it is scheduled to go up another $50,000 – which will mean another $1000 (approx.) for me to pay.  I am single with only my income.  How can I budget from year to year?  My Aunt’s property that was valued at $15,000 five years ago will be valued at over $450,000 this year.  This year’s increase alone is approximately $120,000.  Her land has been in the family for generations – given to her by her mother as her father passed away before the transfer took place.

 

I hear about business property taxes, second homes, and “part-timers”, but what about those of us with dreams and goals?  What about those of us whose families settled here?  There is no consideration for family heritage.  For those of us who are real Florida Natives, land is not looked upon as an investment.  For us, it is a family treasure that has been handed down.  Something that is priceless.  Our descendants worked hard and toiled laboriously to obtain what we have been given.  It is a shame that we may have to consider “selling” because we can’t afford to pay the taxes – not because we’re trying to make it rich.  When you think about the fact that the property is paid for and that taxes are pushing us out, something is very wrong.  I guess that may explain why you very rarely run into a “true” native.....we are a dying breed.

 

Please express this concern for vacant residential parcels.  We should not be discriminated against.  In Charlotte County, I have found properties of similar qualities in which one parcel is experiencing constant increase in assessed value and the other a decrease – year after year.  The same parcel that decreases, the owner’s residential parcels also decrease.  All property should be assessed the same, and the market is going down.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

 

Sincerely,

Melissa C. Knight

Subject:	Isurance rate increase

This is to inform you that I do not need a rate increase on my insurance. nor do I need to pay for insurance of others in this state or any other state. I went through hurricanes Charley and Wilma and was damaged by both. Charley cost me $2400.00 and Wilma cost me $2000.00 OUT of POCKET (that's my pocket) NOT one red cent came from the insurance company; nor did I receive help from FEMA. What am I paying insurance for??? What happened to all the monies the insurance companies received from ALL the years we had know hurricanes??? and why am I paying for damages out of my pocket?? what happened to the monies I paid for protection??? How can this state or even the Federal gov allow these insurance companies collect monies and build expensive buildings , pay excessive salaries and tell the people they have to help and pay the increases they need???
 
I have never made that kind of money Nor have I ever been given that kind of pay increase. This will put a lot of good Americans out of there homes unable to afford their insurance or their tax's. What do you think of less and less monies going to the state to pay your retirements, health, salaries, ect; not to say anything about money to running this state..
 
I would like to have a 97% increase in my social security check do to the excessive rate increase on home owners insurance, water & sewer increase and yes! the excessive increase of GASOLINE; as well as all other products. Hell lets just price  Americans right out of house and Home...This is huge as You well know..And this will cause many home owners their homes, this will put the market in a worse sort than it is today  and most likely cause many mortgage companies huge financial problems as well..
 
I would like to know what's going to happen if this state is hit by another four or five hurricanes again this year; how much of a increase will be asked for then????
This kind of business is wrong! and needs to be stopped. The way I see things is insurances companies enjoy the fruits as long as they don't have to pay out and the minute they do have to pay, they claim were broke or we just need to pull out! And that's so wrong leaving us unprotected and damage not paid for, homes not repaired
and another hurricane season already in progress.
 
I'm trying to sell my home, but do to many  local as well as world wide events its not selling and most likely will not. Home owners insurance is to high, tax's are going to go up utilities are going up, interest rates have totally went out of control. And all because far to many are greedy!!!And yet you all expect the voters to continue to believe
that the elected officials have our best interest at heart.
 
Maybe its time for a state owned insurance fund, where all home owners pay into and all damages paid out for and we tell those insurance companies to get out of Florida and stay out...There's no reason why the state can't invest in the same way and have the necessary built up fund to do the job right and in the best interest of its people.

Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I writing regarding the proposed and given increases for the insurance industry.  How can you justify the increases in insurance premiums, it's getting to where it's going to be very difficult to afford insurance for ones home.  Also, we have to pay for the utilities companies insurance rates in the form of storm increases, when is the consumer going to get their break and have some else pay.  The state just had a 2 billion dollar surplus and you could have direct more toward insurance premiums, and after some monies were redirected then Citizens found a surplus.  When is the consumers going to get a break and not bent over and shafted?   I'm closing in on retirement, but that may be postponed due to your office and the rest of government passing the cost to the end consumer.  I thought the utility companies had their own insurance and why should I have to pay for theirs, they already have more ways to tack on extra cost like fuel charges ect..  Also, the people on the coast live in a high risk area and because I live inland I have to pick up their tab for being incompetent with common sense.
 
So I urge you to take another look at this insurance/utility companies raping of the people of Florida.

Libraries work hard to support your education priorities.  We work with providing the public with Voter Registration and Department of Children and Families Foodstamp and Assistance Forms.
We, as a small library do not have the staff, time, or money to take care of the underpriveleged patrons who need us to help them on the computers to fill out DCF forms.  We do not have enough computers to go around nor the space to put them.  It is very frustrating for us as well as the patrons.  It is also very frustrating for us to try to provide the communities with small libraries the same level of service as larger libraries.  We greatly depend on State Aid, County Funds and City Funds.

I am a resident of Green Cove Springs, FL.  I am a 30 year-old Parkinson’s disease patient and just returned from Washington, D.C. where I went for the press conference, debate and vote on H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Act.  

 

Many people and organizations have worked very hard to convince the House and Senate that this bill has the potential to cure many diseases.  We were all very excited when the Senate voted to pass the bill. 

 

However, it would be very disturbing if President Bush decides to veto this bill.  It would shatter that hopes of millions of people that suffer with Parkinson’s and several other diseases that must live with disabilities and a death sentence every single day.

 

I don’t know if you share the same belief that your brother does on this issue, but please try to see our side for just a moment.  I consider myself pro-life and believe that abortion is wrong.  However, H.R. 810 does not even support the act of abortion.  The only thing that H.R. 810 intends to use for research are embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics that are scheduled to be discarded as human waste.  This process of discarding excessive embryos will continue whether the bill is vetoed or not.  

 

My question to you is this, is an embryo that is going to be thrown away more important than a living and breathing human being suffering with a disease?  Is it more important than me?

 

Please take a few minutes to consider my position along with the millions of other patients that I advocate for and search your heart.  If you can find sympathy in there, please call your brother and pass on this message.  Ask him to reconsider his position on this important issue.  

 

We are desperate for a cure because as each day passes our disease progresses.  We are running out of time.  Please help us.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am part owner of a company that has prided itself on trying to make “it” better. Regardless of what “it” is, there is always room for improvement.  In 2004 when your state pass legislation to regulate the discount health care industry it appeared to be good thing on the surface and we were all for it.  I think when the dust settled all the evidence pointed to the fact that it was too stringent and made it next to impossible for any company to provide a quality service in the state of Florida, thus House Bill 1361.  When I read that there was overwhelmingly passed in congress, one could only assume that Florida was going to “right the ship” and find a more middle ground that allowed businesses with a sincere willingness to help people in Florida find a solution to some of their health care needs. 

 

You sited as one of your main reasons for your veto that complaints have declined since 2004.  Did you ever consider that maybe they declined because the 2004 legislation prevented any company from doing business in Florida?  

 

I agree that there should be some regulation on businesses providing health care.  This protects consumers and the legitimate businesses try to help, but regulating the business to the point that they can not conduct business because of costs of doing business only hurts the consumers’ choice in the market place.

 

Could you help me understand why you vetoed House Bill 1361.

 

Thanks,

First of all let me say, you need to run Mr. McCarty out of office for ever approving a 52.7% state wide increase for homeowner's insurance for State Farm. Unfortunately Martin County is going to receive a 121% increase, not how can that be! But that's what the Stuart News says today. I have already had 2 increases since the hurricanes and now this and then I was informed I didn't have mold insurance but I can get it for an additional $375 per year!!!!!!!  Have you and all the "Powers that be" lost your mind, how do you expect any average person to be able to afford this!!!  There aren' t going to be any people left in the state soon to vote for you or anyone else soon, cause they are going to have to leave the state no one can afford to live here anymore !!!! Just let the state go back to being an island full of oranges and pineapples and no people. And now I'm paying a small fee to get Citizens back in business, give me a break!!!  I think you have all lost your minds. I hope you don't run for office because you wouldn't get my vote that;s for sure and I will picket against McCarty at the next election and Gallagher as well!!!!
It's too bad you don't care enough to talk to your constituents, but obviously you don't!!!

Dear Governor Bush:
 The current situation regarding wind insurance has become a real crisis..  It appears that the various insurance companies decided to sell insurance except for wind (hurricane) insurance.  The only option left for condos, homeowners, etc is to turn to Citizens.  So the insurance company of "last resort" has now become the "first resort" making a mockery of the entire insurance system/business.  And when Citizens demands rates of such exorbitance, we no longer are discussing premium increases.  We now have a perfect example of extortion.
I urge you and the Legislature to do something about this very soon.  A few suggestions: any company wanting to sell insurance in Florida must also sell wind insurance; condos, homeowners, etc should have the right to buy insurance from any company located in the United States (not limited to Florida); insurance rates for wind and flood cannot exceed the rate of inflation (thereafter, if deemed necessary, the additional charges would be paid by the State via taxes).
I hope you take one moment to read the attachment to this email.  It is a letter I had to mail to all the residents in my building.  Governor, please do something quickly.  We need help.
Thank you,

Please support measures to decrease the taxes imposed upon inheritances. 

Earnings are taxed, interest/capital gains on those funds are taxed, and 
again taxed when passed on to the children or grand children of the 
earners. 

Why should we pay taxes AGAIN on funds that have already been taxed so 
many times. Often families have to sell assests (a business or family

Please end this double...triple taxation.

Mr. Governor:
 
When are  you going to address this aituation, when you are out of office and "in the clear" so to speak or are you going to leave your position knowing you did everything for the residents of Florida.  The people are tired of politicians and empty promises, lies and ignorance.  Your attitude of "well they are either going to have to leave Florida or pay the insuirance rates is one of downright insult and offense to the people who put you in office.  Your insurance commissioner has the audacity to run for your position.  You and your cabinet are ignoring a very crucial time in Florida history and all you can worry about is going over seas to promote tourism to a state that might not have many inhabitants very soon because you don't care about the people that put you where you are. The rumor going around that your office is helping to promote the eradication of Florida as we know it seems to be more truthful each day.  Why not let the insurance dilemma pretty much wipe out the poor and middle class, let there be foreclosures so the developers can come in and scoop up the houses for pennies on the dollar from the lending institutions and just rebuild Florida for the rich.  Who do you think will serve those affulent new Floridians.  Hey maybe you will just ferry in some illegal immigrants to work the stores and communiities,  Your responsibility is to the Florida now population, not to the future Floridians.  These people put you in one of the highest positions a person could dream of and you have taken away the dream that all have built.  Your ignoring this very serious issue only proves that you are not a man of your word. You promised answers and remedies- WE DO NOT SEE THEM-WE DO NOT SEE YOU WORKING ON THEM.  WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY SESSION NOW You still have time to make the last portion of your term remembered by all Floridians as the governor stepping in for his people.  Turn the negative into a positive. do it FOR THE PEOPLE

Dear Governor Bush:

Thank you so much for giving once again tax relief for school purchases. 
And for remaining so knowledgable as to the practices of the school boards 
of Florida. I have written to you before, unanswered, and un responded to. 
I wish to bring to your attention, that the school districts have not 
published the requirements for school supplies for the elementary, nor 
secondary schools, to date.

To whom are you giving the tax releif.? Are you in fact lining the pockets 
of WalMart and the like, encouraging school supply purchases, when the 
schools will not accept the items purchased?

Will you answer? Was there a school that you intended to help? Or was this 
a campaign to enrich the suppliers, to send unsuspecting parents to 
purchase supplies, that will not be acceptable by the school 
administrators?

Why would tax releif not be provided after the school purchase 
requirements have been disclosed? Should I believe that my Governor is 
absolutely unaware, but by my informing, that there is a schedule for all 
counties by which we are advised of school requiements for our children. 
And My Governor would inact tax relief, for a limited time only prior to 
this publiction.

Governor Bush, trhis is not the first question I have asked, that may 
remain unanswered. I am ashamed of you. I revere your Brother, and once , 
you as well. It has only been in the last year that I have discovered that 
the political climate may change your inclination to address the concersn 
of the community.

Maybe if I spoke this concern to you in spanish, you would hear.

I have lived in Florida for many many more years then you have and it now looks as though in our GOLDEN YEARS we could lose everything we have worked the 34 years we have lived here because of the INSANE insurance rates of homeowners insurance in this state. I wish we could sell our home and get out of this state but that is not even possible anymore as NO ONE wants to have to pay more than $5,000.00 a year for homeowners insurance. I live in Holiday and we have MORE than 100.000 population in this town and last week listed in the newspaper only FOUR homes were sold, that is pathetic! We do Not live in a fancy home in fact it was built in 1967 and is  a subdivision home. I am one of the very unlucky ones who live a few hundred feet west of US 19 and have to have the wind and hail policy in addition to homeowners. I guess I am lucky I do not live in a flood zone. I would like to know how that wind KNOWS how to stop at US 19 as if the people living just a few hundred feet across US 19 do NOT have to pay for the wind and hail policy and if their roof gets blown off their insurance WILL pay to put it back on. Something is wrong with this picture. I do not live near the water and I believe that people who can afford living on the water SHOULD pay for that but I do not believe I should pay so they can enjoy living on the water. Something is very bad wrong with the insurance in Florida and needs to be fixed NOW. 
You have ignored this problem from the beginning and NOW it is time to face the problem before you have 1000's marching on Tallahassee. I have said it before and will say it again that every politician in this state needs to hang their heads in SHAME for what they are doing to the citizens of this state who voted them in. I belong to HAC an we are trying VERY hard to let the rest of this country know what is going on here in Florida and let them know NOT to come here unless they have BIG BUCKS as that seems to be what you all want. Just remember even the rich need teachers, police,EMS workers, the hairdresser your wives go to the barbers, the farmers and where the heck are these people going to live as NO ONE in those positions can longer afford to live here. 
Politicians MADE this problem with greed and corruption and now THEY need to do something to fix it NOW Call a special session to do something NOW.

Subject:	State Farm Insurance Rates

I am a recently retired resident of Florida and have lived here for almost 12 years now and I am sad to say I am as of today considering moving to another state to avoid paying the new insurance rates your insurance commission approved for State Farm today.  As I understand it State Farm was approved for a 52% increase as of November 1st on existing policy holders.  Never mind the increases it received over the previous 3 years.  It appears it makes no difference that income levels for households have not increased over this same period except maybe if an employer reluctantly gave a cost of living increase which I was not privileged to receive however I did receive this year about a $40 a month increase in my social security (about +2.5%).  Since retiring I now have to pay $400 a month more in health insurance premiums versus what I paid when working, (about +60%).  Property insurance rates are going up and therefore higher property taxes are being charged.  Now you do the math!  I keep hearing how the poor little greedy insurance companies have to pay higher re-insurances rates. Okay, I understand their expenses go up each year as well, but what if they would satisfy themselves with less profit than they normally like to make?  What are they trying to do to lower their expenses?  How much are they paying their executives?  How many agents do they have in Florida that they could do without?  How can your insurance commissioner allow such a hike of 52% insurance rates?  What is just as baffling is that all of the governor candidates this year will not take a stand for the residents of Florida. How disappointing!

 

If someone in Tallahassee doesn’t get serious about supporting the residents of Florida instead of insurance companies, power companies, and sports teams the number of Florida taxpayers will start to drop because people can no longer afford to live in this state. I love living in Florida, but after 12 years I am now beginning to look at other states that do not seem allow insurance companies tell them how to run their state. I don’t really have any other choice as my insurance rates will go up an additional $1508 as of November 1st.  

 

 

It’s been nice living in Florida,

Subject:	Florida's Energy Act - Please help

Mr. Bush,

     Please forgive my e-mail as it may take me longer to type than I should.  First off let me say thank you for signing this into law.  I have wanted to do this with my 3 year old home but the costs, quite frankly, are more than I can afford.  When I saw the incentives that were available, I believe I now can do this.  I would like to re-vamp my entire home to the point where some energy could be sold back to the utility.  In a perfect world, this would work out just fine.  

     But, with anything that is too good to be true, I must say this frightens the heck out of me.  What I mean by this is there is only $2.5 Million allotted in incentives and if each home averaged a rebate of $15,000 then that would only cover 166 home in the entire state of Florida!!!  In order to do this I would have to pay the Solar company $30,000 USD THEN file a rebate application and basically hope that there is money still left over.  I am afraid that is a risk that is quite unreasonable.  I was told via an e-mail this afternoon…

 

The funding is 2.5 million for this year.  The intent is to fund the program for four years 2.5 million per year for a total of 10 million over four years.  Funds must be appropriated every year.  There is no earmark for rebates.  It is first come first served.  The amount of remaining rebate funds will be posted for the public.

…funding would be posted for the public.  I must say Mr. Bush, it has been nothing short of frustrating to get in touch with ANYONE that is willing to help from this agency.  I tried to leave a VM message for Jim and his VM is full.  I had to e-mail him because I did not have confidence that my written name and phone number would be received by Jim.  I followed up with several other questions, but no answer so far.

 

     I guess what I am trying to say Mr. Bush is this is a great program that has totally motivated me to spend a huge amount of money and do what is needed for our country, yet at every step to move forward, I am cut off at the knees with lack of response or the limited amount of “funds”.   I use “” for that word because as a taxpayer and a voter, I know how the government works and I do not feel confident at all that when I am not guaranteed the funds then that is code for “there will be no funds when you file your application”.  

     

     I hope you understand my frustration with this process.  I do understand the state’s issues, but if you want to give incentives to voters like me by saying the funds may or may not be there by the time you spend $30,000 of your hard earned money, then I must say; I do not trust it for a minute.  I am ready to pull the trigger but cannot afford to take a $30,000 hit and hope there are some funds left for me when this process is completed.  It would take 25 years to recoup the cost otherwise.

 

Please let me know if there is any other way to do this, or where is there information as to how much is even left over of the $2.5 million.  Again, I want to do this but cannot risk and hope funds are available.

 

Thank you for your time sir.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I live in Charlotte County, Florida and the local government is attempting to initiate a 400% tax increase in property tax for the year 2006.  It is unbelievable to me that this could be legal.  A tax increase like this will put a major strain on a local economy that has benefited from strong new home construction and land values doubling over the past two years.  This in itself has increased their tax base by 50%.The real estate market is about the only large industry in the area, and an increase in property taxes could be devastating, I feel someone should look into this as we as residents and business owners of this county have had no say, yet.  And the only meeting addressing this issue was closed and then canceled due to the overwhelming number of residents who came to the meeting.  There is another meeting on Thursday July 20, 2006 and I hope to voice my opinion along with just about every one I have spoken with about his matter. It scares me to think that something like this could happen and so many hard-working people still recovering from Hurricane Charley will suffer so greatly for the incompetence of a few.  I realize that they are elected officials and we as voters have an obligation to keep ourselves informed but this has come as a shock and blindsided a lot of people.

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
What are you trying to do to us???  We (my husband and I) are both disabled and as of May 31, 2006, our house insurance was cancelled as it was up for renewal then.  Now we are supposed to make up what the insurance company had to pay (3 times what it had been) for this year and then also let them put away enough in escrow to pay for next year.  Our house payment is almost $700 a month more just for Escrow plus whatever the regular payment is.  We net a little over $2200 a month between us.  I used to be a nurse and my husband taught school for 33 years before we both became disabled.   However, our Social Security doesn't give us a raise but once a year and that is so little that it doesn't help much.  How are we supposed to live.  We don't even get enough to have to pay income tax so a tax break wouldn't help us any.
 
Especially now that there is a law about dispensing physicians.  For the last few years, the Pfizer Connection to Care program has given us the most expensive medications that we have.  Now our doctor has dropped us because of this "dispensing physician" law and we can't find another one who knows what it is.  I have been on the phone for the last two days trying to find someone to help us.  What Pfizer does is:  The doctor signs a form that you have filled out and then writes your prescriptions for a 3-month supply, you send in all of this, and then Pfizer sends the medicine to the doctor's office and they call you to come pick it up.  It is ALL FREE.  Pfizer advised us not to sign up for the Medicare Drug Program or they could not give us our meds for free.  (Not that we could have afforded the drug program anyway).  Between the two of us we spend close to $2,000 a month on medication and doctor bills.  We make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to buy the medicine we need just to be able to take care of ourselves.
 
Please, can you help us out some way.  Pfizer says they cannot send the meds directly to our home.  That is one of the rules of their program.  I have asked them if they know of a doctor in our area that does this and they are not privy to that information.  We live in the Tampa area, but in Pasco County.  All of savings are long gone due to high medical bills and high medicine, before we found out about Pfizer.
 
HELP!!!

Mr. Bush,
 
I would like to know your opion on the off shore drilling here in Florida.  I live in Dunedin,  on the west coast, and am totally against it.
 
Being that you are from such an oil family, what is your postion on the very important subject.  Florida needs the tourism revenue, and drilling 120 miles off the coast could destroy that industry.  Just look at Texas!!.  The beaches there cannot even compare.
 
Please let me know your position.
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor John Bush:

I am writing today to respectfully request your support for SB 772.
The portion of this large education bill that most concerns me relates to childhood obesity. I know that you care about this issue, too, as evidenced by the task force you created and the resulting Obesity Summits.
As your task force recommended, this bill will empower parents to help improve their children’s health.
In addition, SB 772 will help improve academic achievement in Florida. Healthy students are better students – with increased test scores, concentration and attendance, and reduced discipline problems.


SB 772 will encourage parents, communities, students and schools to work together in the fight against childhood obesity.  
In the U.S., the percentage of overweight children has more than doubled, and the percentage of overweight adolescents has tripled in the past 30 years. In Florida, the trend is similar.
Almost 60% of these overweight children have at least one heart or stroke risk factor, and 25% had two or more risk factors.
The implications of childhood obesity are far-reaching. If childhood obesity continues to increase, the current generation of children and the ones behind them will face devastating health and economic consequences.
Many studies and reports support the connection between academic achievement and student health. We cannot expect our children to excel if they are not physically fit.


Gov. Bush, I know you care about our children. Please demonstrate your support by signing SB 772 into law and helping us all work together on the solutions to childhood obesity.
Thank you in advance for your support.

Jeb,

Iam an home owner in broward county and I just cant believe that the State of Florida or your  brother the federal government have no programs available to the residents of broward county to upgrade our homes to huricane standards eg. windows, roofs. I called every telephone number  that I could find on line and  every one told me that there is no help available until we get hit by a hurricane. The state or Fema(your brother) should have some kind of program either low interest  or interest free for low income familys, to up grade their homes before the huricanes hit this way it will cost less to rebuild. Instead you approve insurance hikes and allow companys like Allstate to cancel my auto insurance because I live east of us-1 i was insured with Allstate for 16 years.Unless you change your stand with the insurance companies, it will be a cold day  in hell before I would ever vote for you.Try to save face and do something for the residents of Florida,forget your brothers politics and do the right thing. Help the people that vote for you before the storm not after. as far as the insurance companys go you need to get some balls and stop guaranting them a profit in Florida, insure everybody or get the hell out of Florida, after all you are the governor of Forida not Allstate or are you following in your asshole brothers foot steps.As of today I would never vote for you,and unlike your brother you dont have any one to fix your election.

Thank you Governor Bush for your hard work and sacrifice you have shown towards the men and women abroad.  I am a veteran of 20 years of the United States Air Force.  You and your brother (the President), are awesome and God Bless You and your Family.
 
The reason why I am e-mailing you is to find out if there is any fact or fiction to this rumor.  I am in the process of upgrading my home windows to the impact resistance type purchased from Home Depot.  
 
I heard that I might qualify for a grant to help offset my expense to improve my home.  I was also told that if I go to www.flgov.com that I would find the necessary information to apply for such grant. Well I visited this web site and boy did I get totally lost.  It is hard to ask the right question if you don't know exactly what to ask or search for.
 
So would you please  or someone on your team provide me some guidance.
 
I surely do hope there is some truth to the rumor.

Governor  Bush,

 

Please convince your brother to make our insurance crisis here in Florida one of his last acts before leaving office.  You delivered the State of Florida as he expected and asked.  Many of the people I convinced, I did so based on the theory that he would be very Florida friendly having his brother as governor.  This is payback time.

 

Our crisis is not temporary and is not going to be corrected unless it is nationalized.  There are fires and hurricanes out west.  Snow and ice damage in the northeast.  Tornadoes in the Midwest and south.  At the very least it should be by region.

 

The insurance carriers conveniently invest the excess premiums for years in real estate and other holdings.  These investments have made them huge sums of money, yet that profit is not looked at when running loss ratios and determining which markets are profitable.  They show losses against premiums and ask for rate increases.  It’s not right.

 

Please convince George to help you fix this problem.  Florida is headed for an economic problem on a huge scale in the real estate market if this is not solved and solved quickly.

 

Sincerely,

 

Concerned.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am sure you receive thousands of emails each day.  I am doubtful you will personally read this email; however, I have never felt so compelled to write to a political figure as I do you at this moment.
 
I have been a resident of Brevard County, Florida since 1977.  I own my home, pay taxes contribute to my community and consider Florida to be a delightful place to live.  Recently, I received a letter from Nationwide Insurance Company outlining how the insurance industry is facing challenging times in the Florida marketplace, and as a company, Nationwide has had to make some tough choices.  I happen to be one of their "tough" business choices and had my homeowners policy canceled.  Please note, I have been a loyal customer for twelve years, have paid my premiums on time, never filed a claim and hold automobile coverage, an umbrella policy, boat insurance and a maritime policy with Nationwide.  
 
Nationwide further goes on to state in their letter that my agent may be able to assist me in finding insurance protection with another insurance company.  Guess what.  My current insurance agent can quote me a rate from Lexington Insurance Company.  I was paying $7,000 per year.  The quote from Lexington is for $17,293.16.  I looked at Citizen's Insurance and received a quote over $20,000.  Other insurance companies I contacted were not writing policies at this time.
 
Do you, as governor of Florida, see anything wrong with this?  I understand the principle that a company is in business to make money; however, when a company can arbitrarily drop a customer for no wrong doing and by that action places an undue hardship on that customer, where is the justice?
 
I am well aware insurance is a hot issue in Florida at this time.  I am well aware that insurance companies are worth big dollars.  I just think it is time to place sanctions on insurance companies that conduct business in our state, make a tidy profit and decide to drop customers because "the insurance industry is facing challenging times in the Florida marketplace."  GIVE ME A BREAK!  That is the cost of doing business.  What about the hardship Nationwide has thrust on the customers it has canceled.  Nationwide talks about its overall catastrophic loss.  Well, guess what, it is catastrophic for homeowners to be placed in a position where they must incur expenses they cannot afford or did not plan for.  For the homeowner who has been canceled, there is no choice but to pay.  So glad it's all right for insurance companies to control a homeowner's purse strings in the state of Florida.
 
Governor Bush, I understand you leave office in January of 2007.  I understand running a state is no easy task.  I just think our state government needs to put more thought and action in to protecting its citizens from the insurance companies who are currently in our state and deciding to take flight leaving citizens in a compromised position.

Debra Clarke

Governor Bush,
 
The insurance industry for many years enjoyed prosperity and used their Florida profits for investments and expansion nationwide. Along came Hurricane Andrew and a few years later
came Charlie and all his relatives. Then like the biblical prodigal son, they claimed they’re now broke and got the state to carry the load at the expense of the policyholders. Now they’re requesting horrendous premium increases, a serious hardship particularly on retirees. Many insurers are dropping property insurance, leaving the state while being allowed to cherry pick other lucrative insurance plans.
 
A long term solution will take some time and compromise, however temporary short term emergency legislature stating:
    
      “Any insurer dropping property insurance and leaving the state, be also required to drop ALL other   plans and no longer be permitted to sell in the state of Florida, assigning those policies to competitors who are staying”.
 
My guess is the ‘immediate result’ would be some creative re-thinking on the part of the industry spreading their P & L’s nationwide rather than by local or state profit centers,
 
Respectfully,
Don Janda

Dear Gov. Bush:

I'm writing you to see if my suggestion could be implimented concerning
Citizens Insuranc.

I'm president of my small condo association (20) doors, and in the last 2
years I've seen our insurance premiums go from just under $6,000 a year last
year with Allstate, to this year with Bankers insurance for $14,500.  My
agent says Bankers will not renew us next year and that we will have to go
to Citizens Insurance and it'll probably be around $25,000.  We all know
that there is an insurance crises in Florida (particularly Pinellas County
which is where we are) and we are willing to bite the bullet and pay the
$25,000 but we just found out that they do not accept payments and we'll
have to finance our payment and pay another $1,000 for that privledge.

I feel that as long as we have to pay such high rates that the least they
could do is let us pay a certain amount down and for $3.00 to $5.00
additional each month make payments for 10 months like most other insurance
companies do.  After all we can't pick up and go out of town and skip out on
the bill.

I've called the Dept. of Finance  to complain and they tell me there is
nothing they can do about it, so I'm writing to you and my legislators to
see if this can be accomplished.

Please let me know.

Dear Lt. Governor Toni Jennings:	
 	
I am writing to express my appreciation for your voting against reductions to the Medicaid program. As a member of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), I am grateful for your efforts to oppose cuts to this critical health care safety net for the most vulnerable. As you know, the budget reconciliation package contains provisions which would be disastrous for Medicaid beneficiaries living with severe mental illness. Of greatest concern are provisions in the legislation (S 1932) that will allow states to impose higher cost sharing for critical services such as prescription drugs, physician services and emergency room care. These higher cost sharing requirements are certain to result in large numbers of Medicaid recipients with mental illness not being able to access basic treatment and supportive services. The bill will also allow states to limit coverage on existing Medicaid services for many beneficiaries, placing at risk critical early intervention services for children. I urge you to continue to oppose these reductions to the Medicaid program. It is simply unfair to impose higher cost sharing and additional benefit cuts on the most vulnerable.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing you about the serious Insurance crisis in the state of Fl., and to request your help in any manner you are willing and able to give. I am a condo owner at Lake in the Woods Condo Association in Melbourne Fl. The grounds and 106 Condo units have been insured by State Farm Insurance Co. for 19 years, and to the best of my knowledge, have never filed a claim. Our current premium is $35,000 a year. We have been informed by State Farm that they will not renew our policy for 2007. After extensive searching by our Condo board, the only insurance company willing to insure a condo association is Citizen's Insurance. They have informed the board the premium for 2007 will be $167,000 !!! This is a 477% increase !!! And they have required the premium be paid in full by Dec. 2006. This will require an assessment of about $1500 per condo unit. I am a working person and will find it difficult to come up with $1500 by Dec. But there are many senior citizens in this community who will be unable to pay this at all. 
 
I implore you to intervene in any way you can and/or offer us some direction in this matter. You are currently in public office and may seek other public office in the future. "We the people" need assistance right now and I'm sure gratitude would be shown on election day. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
We have been residents of Florida for 17 years and are registered Republicans who helped elect you.  We are also retired, on a fixed income and in shock over having been told by our condo management that we are facing a 400% increase in our condo insurance rates.
 
State owned Citizens, which is our insurance of last resort since our current carrier went bankrupt, has instituted a new "A" rating for complexes valued at more than $10,000,000.  Based on data provided to us by Brown and Brown of Sarasota, this will result in about a 400% increase of our budgeted insurance premium from August 15, 2006 to August 15, 2007.
 
We are residents of Ashton Lakes Condominium Community in Sarasota Florida.  There are 223 units:  86 of them are occupied by full-time owners, 44 are investment units, and we estimate 50% of the remaining 93 units to be owned by voter eligible homesteaders.  That is a block of 130 eligible voters for local and State elections.
 
There is no doubt that many of our residents will not survive this huge additional expense.  We sincerely hope that you will give your full attention to this very serious situation .

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I work as an emergency dispatcher for the Royal Palm Beach Police Department and am asking for your support on an issue that is of extreme importance.  
 
House Bill 9 (sponsored by Representative Robaina) and Senate Bill 936 (sponsored by Senator Bennett) will provide enhanced retirement benefits for 9-1-1 operators and emergency dispatchers. 
 
Each day, citizens throughout the State of Florida dial 9-1-1 to receive urgently needed assistance in times of crisis.  Specially trained public safety telecommunications personnel must answer each call quickly and make instant decisions on the deployment of law enforcement, fire rescue, and EMS resources.  Public Safety Telecommunicators are under constant stress as they make life and death decisions based on what limited information is available over the phone. They also work each day with the realization that an error could result in a serious injury or even death to law enforcement personnel, firefighters, paramedics, or a member of the community.
 
Senate Bill 936 and House Bill 9 will allow employees like me to receive benefits under the Special Risk category.  This change would enable a dispatcher to retire with twenty-five years of service in the Florida State Retirement System.  As I am sure you know, today in Florida an emergency dispatcher is forced to work thirty (30) years in order to retire with only 48% of their average salary.  


 
The skill level and mental acuity required to function in a busy 911 center makes it very difficult for dispatchers reach thirty years of service. Medical problems relating to constant shift work and other stressors frequently require our employees to retire early, and face significant penalties in their retirement benefits.
 
As a citizen of your district, I know that you care about public safety and the importance of the 9-1-1 system as the first line of defense in any emergency.  I hope I can count on your to lend your support to this most important bill.
 
I would be honored to answer any questions that you or your staff may have regarding the 9-1-1 system and our employees.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am presently a snowbird in Largo Florida and will be a Florida Full Time resident beginning in November.  You have to do something pertaining to then insurance crisis.  Our insurance has skyrocketed and were only able to obtain Citizens coverage without any theft or robbery insurance or any damage from broken pipes.  We people on a fixed income need help as soon as possible in obtaining decent coverage to protect our few belongings at a reasonable rate.  
 
Any assistance you and your legislature can  render is appreciated.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am extremely disappointed at how the legislative session ended. Finally, we (South Floridians) had enough votes in the Senate for the Florida Marlins tax rebate but the transparent political maneuvering allowed the clock to run out consequently killing the bill. I am upset that the usual suspects used their power to impose their will and, once again, prevented a vote from happening. 

 

Our state’s lack of support for anything that is meaningful to South Florida continues.  The tax dollars we generate are used throughout the state and yet we seem to be the red-headed step-child that is looked upon as a separate entity.  This has been going on as far back as I can remember and I am almost 50 years old.

 

As a registered voter for 31 years and a Republican, I ask you to stand up for us seeing as how you are a former South Floridian yourself.  If you don’t, who will? 

Any action you could take to help keep our 2-time World Series Champions where they belong would be greatly appreciated and never forgotten.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	The cost of living in Florida

Dear Governor Bush,

I lived in Florida for 35 years having moved there in 1970 after 4 years in the Military.  I wanted to go to college and coach high school baseball so I knew from the beginning I was in the right spot.  I was the assistant baseball coach at Tampa Jesuit from 1992 until 2004 when I decided that I and my wife could no longer afford to live in Florida.

I retired from coaching after helping our team win 3 state championships and 1 national championship and loved every minute on it even though I was an UNPAID assistant coach.  The reason I retired from coaching was that I could no longer afford to live in Tampa and I asked my company Sprint to allow me to move to Columbus Ohio.

My wife and I are so sad that I can no longer contribute to the success of young baseball players in the Tampa Bay Area but I had to sell my home in Palm Harbor because of the terrible increases in insurance costs.  So we took the opportunity to sell our condo villa in Palm Harbor and moved to Columbus.  We sold our unit for $245,000 that was 20 years old and never had an insurance claim in the 35 years that I lived there and purchased a brand new condo, bigger and nicer for $145,000 with home owners insurance of $345.00 per year.

During the time I lived in Florida the Insurance industry made plenty of profit, more than they ever had to pay out and you and I know that is a true statement.  Today they hold the hammer because their profits are not so good and you allow them to raise their rates so high that I had to move away because I could no longer afford to live there.

What about all of the profits they made over the years because you and I both know that there have not been that many destructive hurricanes hit Florida since 1970?  Yes there was damage the past two years but that did not wipe out the profits from the previous 35 years.

Anyway, to close, my wife and I love it up here and the other day I received a letter from a young man who I held a coaching session with a month ago which said I taught him more about hitting in the 4 hours I spent with him than he ever learned from any other local coaches.  

Florida’s loss is Ohio’s gain.

You will lose many more before it is over.

Respectfully,

    WITH THE RECENT NEWS OF A MAJOR HOME INSURANCE COMPANY DROPPING HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND HOME PROTECTION POLICIES, BUT RETAINING THE LUCRITIVE AUTO INSURANCE POLICIES IS A MAJOR SLAP IN THE FACE OF THE RESIDENTS OF FLORIDA.  I FEEL YOU SHOULD INFORM THIS COMPANY THAT IF THEY WANT TO DROP HOME PROTECTION POLICIES THEY WILL ALSO DROP AUTO POLICIES.   TELL THEM ITS ALL OR NOTHING.  IF THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS, MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL FOLLOW SUIT.  LET THEM  INSURE HOMES, AUTO AND BOATS IN NORTH DAKOTA, NOT IN FLORIDA UNLESS THEY WILL INSURE ALL PROPERTIES, NOT A SELECT SEGIMENT.

I  HAVE A CONCERN, I BOUGHT MY HOME A YEAR AGO IN AUGUST AND RECEIVED AN INSURANCE POLICY FROM POE INSURANCE.  THEY KNEW FOR AWHILE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CANCEL EVERYONES INSURANCES, WHY DID THEY WAIT UNTIL THE HEIGHT OF HURRICANE SEASON TO DO IT.  THEY TOOK MY MONEY ALL YEAR AND THEN WHEN HURRICANE SEASON CAME UPON US THEY SENT OUT THE LETTERS.
 
BECAUSE MY HOME WAS BUILT IN 1994, I CAN NOT GET INSURANCE UNLESS I PAY 3 TIMES OF WHAT I DID
LAST YEAR.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WILL NOT WRITE POLICIES THIS TIME OF YEAR.
 
I AM A REALTOR AND I CAN SEE THAT THIS WILL HURT OUR SENIOR CITIZENS.  I KNOW WHEN AND IF
I GET TO RETIRE IN A FEW YEARS I WILL HAVE TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT STATE, OUR TAXES ON OUR HOMES HAVE SKY ROCKETED AND THE INSURANCE HAS TRIPLED.  JUST TO LIVE IN MY HOME I WILL HAVE TO PAY ALMOST $900.00 A MONTH NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE IN A FEW YEARS WHEN I READY T0 RETIRE.  SINCE I CAN'T MAKE MORE THAN
$19,000 ON SOCIAL SECURITY HOW TO DO THE GOVERNMENT EXPECT AN AVERAGE HOME OWNER TO SURVIVE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW MY CHILDREN WILL DO IT.
 
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES THEY ARE ALSO CHARGING US THESE HIGH PRICES BUT ANYTHING THAT HAS COST MONEY DOING HURRICANE SEASON THEY ARE EXCLUDING (LANAI'S, ROOFS, ETC) THIS IS NOT RIGHT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT.

Hello Mr. Bush,

My wife and I moved from Massachusetts to the Fort Myers in late March.   We have always wanted to live in Florida and finally made the move. (We are in our 40's w/o any children)

You are very well aware of the insurance issue, but I was hoping you would listen to a suggestion.  Some people say to charge an extra 1% on Fl. State Tax.   My proposal is something on a Federal Scale.   

When we file our yearly taxes with the IRS, how about if 50% of our insurance costs are tax deductable?

Thank you for your time,

Governor Bush
I am glad to hear that you are attempting to resolve the issues with the 
state insurance program.  However , some thing must be done about the 
private insurance companies. If the rates continue to increase both 
companies and residents will be leaving this state in droves. Additionally 
no company will consider moving into the state because of the ludicrous 
insurance rates.
Insurance is not the only issue. Additionally the utility rates and rates 
for water are too high. It is bad enough to be threatened by hurricanes, but 
it is intolerable to be ripped off by insurance companies, phone companies, 
and utility companies. Greed is running rampant in Florida and I have not 
seen either you or the legislature do any thing about it. I hope that you 
will not sit by and do nothing like the federal government.

Governor Bush,
 
I have resided in Florida since 1993 and have been quite happy here.  My husband passed away recently and now I am in the same position as many other Florida widows and there are many of us.  Some of our income has been discontinued.
 
If the insurance on my place continues to rise as it has this year, $54,000 to $244,000  I will not be able to remain in this beautiful state.  I am sure that this is very upsetting to the people who head our state and counties and I hope you can find an answer  to keep the people here.  As you know the state has many retired residences who are on fixed incomes and cannot pay these extreme increases.  
 
I live in Steeplechase Condominiums in Kings Lake in Naples Florida and the only company that would insure us with wind after we were dropped by our previous insurer is AmRisk( subsidiary of Lloyds of London).  We were hoping to get a quote from Citizens but they could not give us one until our other insurance had expired for about one month.   The new insurance demanded a 80% fulfillment of our contract so we could not take advantage of one from Citizens if it was lower.  The Board of our group is in a impossible position.  They cannot allow us not to be insured so there is nothing left for them to do.   The insurance companies can make the demands and we can do nothing about it.  Heaven knows what the rates will be 2007.
 
This is a short email not to give you all the details but to let you know how hard it is for the average resident.  I am emailing you and other heads of our State and County to please find a way to allow many residents the chance stay.

Subject:	possible solution to the wind insurance problem?

Dear Jeb,
 
After watching the news last night, I already knew that we had an insurance problem. We tried to purchase land and building for our business and could not find any company to insure it. That mean't we could not close on the property and were are stuck in an insurance mess. We had to cancel the deal because our bank required the insurance to close on the property. 
 
After watching the news... I had a thought....Think about this... What if... The State of Florida established an insurance escrow fund payable by the homeowners and residents of this state?  Lets say that when a property or land is purchased or even sold... a certain amount of money goes to this escrow account and it... lets say... becomes mandatory in Florida or in any State near the water coast...(you would think with the amount of people in these states) it could grow to an amount that could cover damages in the event of a major hurricane? A department of the state government would be responsible to administer the funds and recieve them. It would be placed in an account controlled by the state and dispersed by order of the governors office in an emergency? A minimum escrow amount would be set from 25 to 50 billion dollars. A paper with your name on it from the state lets you know that the funds and your account is current. Enough money hopefully to cover rebuilding lives and property. Homeowners and residents could fill out claims and submit them to the state agency for processing who in turn could hire independent or have contracted adjusters to inspect the damages to homes. Also, The homeowners may consider hiring a licensed and insured contractor to apraise the damage and submit proof to the state to recieve the funds needed for repairs. The funds should then be distributed in installments as each stage of repair is completed and inspected and approved by the State office who controls the funds. Try to picture this in your mind because I did. I know it may seem a little bit out there but I truly believe it will work. You may have to make some adjustments because you know our State government better than me or you can throw just this out because theres some legality issues.
I do hope that an answer lies out there. I hope I may have helped you with my suggestion. I want to thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail.
Take care now... and God bless Florida... and all its residents this hurricane season. We all have suffered enough.

I do not want this answered by that form letter your flunkies are sending out.
 
Isn't it time that you faced the fact that not being able to afford the cost of Homeowners insurance is putting many people in the position of either losing their home to the bank or to the possibility of losing it to a storm?  What's the difference?
 
You said you wanted solutions in your address on TV.  So far the ones that I have heard are just so much political rhetoric!
 
Try these!  Who knows, they might make some sense, but action better be taken fast or the legislature better start getting their resumes up to date because they will be out of work!
 
First and foremost freeze all premium increases, immediately, retroactive to 1/01/2005 and refund them back to the policyholders in cash or advance premiums.
 
Second: Call in an outside auditing firm for a complete, immediate audit of Citizens Insurance back to its inception.  This would include investigation of the known and hidden graft of bribery, paying full claims on underinsured properties and other known instances of criminal activity.  The Attorney General, who is a Governor want to be, could make a good name for himself issuing indictments and demanding retribution in these cases.
 
Third: Instead of making Citizens Insurance an insurance company of last resort, make it a reinsurance company for regular insurance companies.
 
Forth:  Forbid any insurance company, doing business in other states, from spinning off a company such as Allstate of Florida etc, to only do business in Florida and use that as an excuse to charge high premiums.  The principal of insurance is to spread the risk over a large area.
 
Fifth:  Forbid cherry picking.  If an insurance company sells Auto insurance as well as Homeowners and other lines of insurance, it must offer them all, in all counties of the state.
 
Sixth:  The State Insurance Dept. should be led by an experienced Insurance person, elected by the people, who would have a committee of experienced Actuaries and Underwriters that would be able to sensibly approve or disapprove rates and increases.
 
Seventh:  To make the state more attractive for companies to do business in, put teeth in the Auto insurance laws in this State.  Make the minimum insurance requirement $20,000-$40,000 liability with strict fines and/or punishment for non compliance.  Also require proof of insurance on any traffic stop and for issuance of license plates.
 
This inactivity of you and our legislature is on the verge of wrecking the economy of this state and could very well hand this state over to the Democrats on a silver platter come this next election.  This is a crisis that is proven by over 10,000 signatures on petitions signed by people about to leave the state, losing their homes and facing financial ruin and it sure won't attract business or tourism.
 
Isn't it about time that you stop listening to the insurance lobby and do right for the people of the state?  I can't believe that insurance companies are going to pass up the money they can make in this state by doing legitimate business.

Dear Jeb,

I know that you and your staff are getting a lot of letters and emails regarding the Huge homeowner and business rate increases we are receiving in the mail every day.  We as a state, must limit these increases.

A concerned insured recently wrote in our Melbourne, Florida Today opinion column that "Even with a record number of storms last year, the insurance companies made a record $43 billion profit in 2005, the highest net income since 1991"! If this is true, we must approve much lower rate increases!

In my case:

In Aug. 2003, I paid $1,559.00 a year, for my homeowner's insurance policy. In previous years, I paid considerably less.

In Aug. 2004, I had to pay $3,836.00 due to the fact that Prudential sold their causality business to Liberty Mutual.

In Aug. 2005, I had to pay $6,058.00.

In Aug. 2006, now I must pay $9,464.00!

Also, in the past four years, the deductible, where the insurance company pays me nothing for a claim, which actually acts as a increased premium, has increased by many thousands of dollars, on my homeowner's insurance policy! 

This state of affairs represents, to me, a lack of responsible oversight on the part of our department of Insurance Regulation.

Please help us!!!

Subject:	Citizens Windstorm-


Governor Bush- 

I saw the interview with you yesterday regarding the insurance situation in our state. Here's what I believe needs to happen as it relates to Citizens Property / Windstorm coverage and the entire insurance issue in an effort to stabilize the market:

In order to attract insurance companies back into the state, we need to have a tiered type coverage format: 

1. The insured needs to have higher deductibles (both residential and commercial). 

2. Companies (including Citizens) need to rate policies by different levels of exposure. South Florida policy holders need to pay more than Central and North Florida policy holders. Beachside policy holders need to pay more than inland policy holders. Types of construction as it relates to rates needs to be revised, etc. I know some of this is already being done, but these guidelines need to be revised and updated……….NOW. There needs to be substantial credits and surcharges for types of construction and location. If a person elects to build / live in a high exposure area, then they need to pay for the premium. Not everybody else!

3. Companies should take the second layer of coverage which will get them in a comfort zone by limiting their exposure. 

4. The state company, Citizens, needs to take the higher (catastrophic) layer. And, we as residents of the state need to contribute some reasonable amount of dollars each and every year to create a CAT fund that will have the ability to pay for this layer. We need to surcharge hotel nights, college and professional sporting events, and conventions, etc. to add to the CAT fund. If it's $ 100 per year per policy, and $ 2 per hotel night or sports ticket…that's the way it is.

5. Companies need to have rates approved that will give them the confidence to come back or stay in our market. 

6. Finally……..and this is IMPORTANT……..Citizens or any other company should NOT WRITE COVERAGE for any properties over a certain age unless that structure has documented updates. And, if it's over a certain age of let's say…………30 years, and it's not joisted masonry construction or better….it doesn't get written or it has another higher level of deductible.

I know this may sound simplistic, and I'm giving you the "quick input" here, but come on………………let's get this done! All the politicians say we don't need to be in the insurance business, but maybe what we need to do is change the way we are in it. Then, if we can get out down the road……great. But, for now we are in it, and changes must be made. Let's look at the alternatives instead of just keep on saying "we don't need to be in the business".

You said you wanted suggestions! 

Thank you for your time.

I understand that you recently vetoed funding for the priority research projects recommended by the Florida Ocean and Coastal Resources Council, created by the legislature in 2004.  The veto also included funding for operating costs for the Council to continue it's work.  Since most, if not all, of the research projects that were recommended for funding directly address issues that are of critical importance to advancing the work of your "Governor's Action Plan for Healthy and Resilient Coasts," as well as advancing the work of Gulf of Mexico Alliance, what is the rationale for vetoing the funds for this research, as well as the operating budget of the Council?  How can we protect Florida's coasts without developing sound science specifically directed at improving management, which is what the Council recommended, and the Legislature approved?

Dear Sir:

 

I think that the position in which the insurance community has placed our citizens, is unconscionable!! Some of us can decide to go without home owners insurance if we don’t have a mortgage, but the vast majority of home owners are forced to carry insurance by the mortgage holder and at this time, quite often are stressed to the point of breaking, by the increases in monthly mortgage payments. Most of the increases are due to outrageous insurance premium increases. I have friends who were notified that their carrier wasn’t going to renew their policy and “good luck” finding someone else to cover them.

 

I have heard that the Citizens company, by law, cannot write policies for less than any private company. This is also ludicrous. Why is the state protecting these greedy companies? We pay premium for years and years….some of us have never had a claim against the companies and yet we still suffer for their so called “need to succeed”.

 

It is very frustrating for us and I’m sure to you too, but something MUST be done to help us. Surely someone in your “Brain Trust” should be able to find an equitable solution. We the voters  are demanding that something be done to protect our homes and pocket books.

Subject:	Insurance Crisis and Property Taxes

Dear Governor Bush:

 

The insurance crisis here in Florida has reached a crisis level which I’m sure you are already aware.  It is my intent in writing this email to you to express the sentiments of myself and many of the residents of our community.  I am the president of the Island Estates Civic Association, a waterfront community residing in Clearwater Beach.  In the past three years, our residents have experienced exponential increases of their insurance rates and escalating property taxes.  Obviously, most all are insured with Citizens Property Insurance Corporation as they have no alternative.  Many who live in our community are long time residents, retired and living on fixed incomes.  This situation, along with the rising property taxes, is forcing many homeowners with fixed incomes to contemplate selling their homes causing them to be confronted with other menacing challenges.

 

The insurance issue is not one easily solved because the large private insurance companies have segmented and declined high risk customers in efforts to optimize their profits.  The pure concept of insurance is sound, to spread the costs and risks of loss over many homeowners so that when catastrophes happen, there are adequate reserves, derived from those who did not experience losses, to take care of those unfortunate victims.  In the case of Florida, the losses in the past few years have been many more than anticipated by the actuarial analysts.  As a result, the insurance companies have been cancelling policies and withdrawing from high risk markets.  In keeping with the concept of insurance, the risk assessments cannot be micro-managed to squeeze every nickel of profit out of a particular market or withdraw from the market.

 

I believe the government must urgently focus on this crisis and force the insurance companies to write homeowner policies or ban them from writing other lines in Florida (those multiple line companies that offer homeowner policies in other states but not Florida).   However, it is acknowledged, there is a risk that these insurers will simply discontinue doing any business in Florida for all lines of insurance thus leaving Florida with additional challenges.  

 

If the State governing bodies are unwilling to confront and stand up to these insurance companies withdrawing their homeowners’ lines, another alternative is for the State to take over all homeowners’ policies thus spreading risks throughout all of Florida.  Currently, the way Citizens has been established, to underwrite only policies in high risk areas, is a recipe for certain failure.  It will require constant subsidies and increasing rates that ultimately will require such high premiums, eventually homeowners will be unable or unwilling to afford them and will be forced to self insure.  Self insuring is not the answer for when a catastrophe does occur, many of these people will have lost everything and turn to the government for assistance thus adding to the problem.  The Citizen program also defeats the concept of insurance to spread the risk over a wide range of risk factors so that no one element bankrupts the program.  

 

If commercial underwriters are able make decisions to abandon our markets, and the States Citizens Property Insurance program is not modified, then the insurance industry should be taken over by the Federal Government!  As an alternative of a national insurance program, I can hear the people in California, Kansas and New England objecting to pay for our hurricane damage in Florida.  But what about Floridians paying for losses caused in other areas?  Examples are the earthquakes in San Francisco and L.A., or the mudslides in Malibu, the wild fires destroying homes in the west, the tornadoes in Kansas and the Floods in New England?  Under a Federal program, we would all be in the same program, spreading risks to a wide variety of people and potential maladies to ensure the welfare of each other.  I liked your idea of a national disaster pool and believe it should be strongly promoted and supported.  Too bad you aren’t advocating it from Indiana instead of Florida, maybe then others would listen.

 

The other issue I wanted to bring to your attention was the escalating property taxes.  Of course the main driver to these increases, in most cases, is not millage but the increasing property values due to the influx of population migration to Florida.  Again, I would like to respectfully call your attention to this dilemma affecting our older population (if not our younger).  With the save our homes cap in Pinellas County, the property tax cannot increase more than 3.0% or the inflation rate, whichever is less.  However, in our community, as mentioned previously, many retirees are squeezed by the insurance rates and over time the property taxes.  Those who have lived in their home for many years and bought before the property boom have relatively low taxes but they are still increasing yearly.  If they are forced to sell and purchase another property even at perhaps half the price of what they sold their existing property, their new tax base will be at current escalated market value and they will pay even higher property taxes than they had before.

 

Two items to consider are the Homestead Exemption which was implemented many years ago at $25,000 and portability of taxable value.  The $25,000 exemption in real dollars today is worth far less than it was when it was implemented and is not relative (percentage wise) to today’s average home values.  Consideration should be given to adjusting and increasing the homestead exemption so that its “real” value today is what it was when it was implemented.  It is suggested on a going forward basis, this exemption should be adjusted each year (by the inflation or deflation rate) so that this original benefit inures to those for whom it was intended.  The other consideration should be to enable our senior citizens to carry the “taxable value” of their current property to another home (perhaps limiting this to a one time event) so they are not relegated to substandard living conditions because they cannot afford the property taxes.

 

Thank you in advance for your thoughtful attention and consideration to these matters.

Governor Bush- you owe your the citizens and residents of Florida an answer- we can't all be wrong and even if the rates before were not accessed correctly- you cannot expect people to come up with money they do not have and they don't deserve to lose their homes because the insurance industry cannot run their business correctly.  Many of these people might have been able to sell as the rates started going up and have gone somewhere where they could have started again or retired in peace.  Now you have seniors starving, without meds and still losing their homes. Is this how you want to be remembered. I was taught that it is not how you look or how much you have, but how much you do and give. Your term is not up and you are not yet done.  All the positive things you and your cabinet have done will be for nothing if this is not addressed soon. Just look below at how Florida sees this situation.  These are the people that put you in office. They deserve your response to them publicly, spelled out, questions answered, you need to explain all the options, what they can expect and where it is going to lead.

Subject:	Insurance and lack of Florida control over companies and cost

Florida is killing the golden goose that help make Florida what it is today.  
 
Why would anyone think about becoming a Snow Bird and buy in Florida or move to Florida?  Insurance is a MESS and a laughing stock to people outside of Florida.  Citizens Insurance is totally in the pocket of the insurance companies plus they are in debt for millions.  My condo in Melbourne has just been dropped by our carrier of 20 years and we have to go to Citizens at a huge price increase.  We are having a special assessment of $1200 that needs to be paid by December so we can give Citizens a check for $168000 (Citizens doesn't even offer monthly payments.) THEN we have to increase our condo fee from $195 to $325 monthly to build out reserves for insurance!  There are older people who can't pay this and will be forced to sell (at reduced prices because of the condo fee and insurance cost) and go elsewhere.
 
Property taxes are out of site due to lack of control of growth.  If the snow birds ever get tried of being screwed over Florida is in big trouble -- I know they don't vote so Florida does care but they will vote with there feet.
 
I have been telling my friend back east to forget Florida or rent for 3-4 months don't buy.
 
This year I can vote and will organize voter in my area to vote to change Florida and to vote for those who care about the people and not the insurance companies.
 
At the same time educating the snow birds about how badly they are being screwed.

Dear Governer Bush,

PLEASE VETO HB 699.
This bill only outcome will be economic gain by a small handful of physician 
groups.
There is NO evidence based reason for the development, nor the passing of
this type of bill, and legislators should only discuss these types of bills 
supportive evidence.

I believe that this bill will create a significant split in the way our 
rural and
urban populations as well as NPs will be treated.

HB 699/SB 1216A  This  bill is unnecessary, it "protects" one population, 
but supposedly leaves another vulnerable. Clearly a violation of every 
ethical standard we hold  in health care.
This bill creates two classes of citizens, the elite urban and the throw 
away rural resident of Florida.
Only a few, selected physician groups will benefit economic gain from this 
legislation.
This bill is interpreted by many as a restraint of trade, and the effects 
will be felt by physician and
mid-level alike.
The list of exempted facilties include college programs, continued care, 
rural health clinics or health clinics in federal or state programs- this  
disparity questions why is it safe here but not in wealthy private medical 
practices in affluent areas? all this indicates that this bill is economic 
driven directed towards urban dermatology practices.
This bill was sponsored by Senator Joe Negron without any significant 
research or data to support the proposed concern for patient's safety, there 
is abundant research to support the safety
and efficacy of Nurse Practitioners for over 30 years. This research has 
been offered by individuals at house bill 699 hearing, but NOT requested by 
one legislator.
Please continue your support for the nurses in Florida, and VETO this bill.
Sincerely, Michal Nizan

A suggestion would be a congress / senate vote that any company thats sells Auto insurance ( a lucrative market)

I understand from the State Tax Office that the above bill was passed several months ago by the State Legislature and sent to you for signature but that you have not signed it as yet. Is there a reason for the delay?
Many taxpayers, including my wife and myself, are trying to do year end tax and budget planning and would like to know if your signing is imminent. Would you please let me know by return email?
 
I suspect that the announcement of your signing would be likely be picked up on the AP and could be helpful as an encouragement to the housing industry - particularly for out-of-staters who might be on the fence about buying a home and moving to Florida at this time..

Subject:	another insurance saga

I'm sure you have been inundated with stories of insurance coverage woes.  I just wanted to add my saga to the growing list of stories.  I am a single parent and I have struggled financially to provide for my children.  
They are teenagers now who are becoming fine citizens and I am extremely proud of their accomplishments academically and in the area of community service.  

I was finally able to become a homeowner of a modest home in September of 2003.  At that time, only Citizens was writing policies in my area and my annual premium was around $700.  Then, at the 2004 renewal time, my premium increased to around $900.  Still ok.  When the 2005 renewal came around, the premium jumped to around $2100.  At that time, I was able to get a policy with USF&G for approximately the same amount but with increased coverage on my home (increasing replacement value coverage) so I changed carriers.  That was a bit of a struggle but I borrowed the money to pay the premium because home owners insurance is not really a luxury I can do without.  Just last week, I received the bill for the premium that is due in September 2006 and it is for nearly $3800.  I'm still working out how to pay that.  And, even if I come up with the premium, I will not have the deductible available in the event of a claim.  Savings is not in the foreseeable future with premiums like this.

I'm sure this weighs heavily on your mind.  You seem to be a fair and concerned person when it comes to the well being of your constituents.  I wish I had a simple solution to offer for this growing problem but I don't.  Because of the increases in the costs of insurance coverage, I am one of the people who might have to relocate to stay afloat financially.  My salary has increased at an average of 2-3% per year, as it has for most everyone I know.  

Perhaps a federal tax deduction or credit would ease the pain of the premium.  In the long run, I can see that as a benefit to homeowners.  In the short run, it doesn't help to come up with the premium, though.

Thanks for listening.  Sorry to ramble.  You have been a fine political leader.  I will follow and support your career when you leave us.  You and your family are in my prayers.

Dear Governor Bush,

As you can see by the response below (which is slightly in error as I did 
e-mail Mr. McCarty directly from his department's website), the buck is 
being passed.  Maybe rightly so, but I am not an expert on the matter so it 
"feels" like a brush-off.  I did check the legislature site, but for some 
reason I was not able to get the e-mail page to work.  I will try again.
Since first e-mailing you, I received a few calls from friends who saw my 
name on the local NBC affiliate's evening news.  Apparently, Channel 8 here 
in Tampa is investigating the homeowner's insurance issue and part of my 
e-mail was used.  Of course, I was thrilled.  But, more importantly, my 
hopes were raised that something significant might actually come of my newly 
undertaken e-mail crusade.

Mr. Bush, I implore you, as I will my legislators, to intervene on behalf of 
Florida's citizens who own homes.  Personally, I think that last year's toll 
of hurricanes was an oddity.  I have lived here in the Tampa Bay area since 
I was 13 months old and have never before experienced what we did last year. 
  My older siblings were all born in Tampa and two of them have lived here 
all their lives and have never experienced what we did last year.  According 
to local history, the last such events were in the 1910s.  How can insurance 
companies, whose profits are probably close to those of the petroleum 
companies, justify all the past years of collecting premiums and the 
percentage of pay-outs to some projection of future hurricanes?  If this is 
how Florida law works, then it needs to be changed.  In my mind, no amount 
of projecting future losses can justify our personal homeowner's policy rate 
jumping over 100% in one single year.

Let me close by saying that I will continue to communicate with you as long 
as the need to lower homeowner's insurance rates in Florida exists.  Thank 
you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Guy:

Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Tom Gallagher shared your e-mail with me and 
asked that I respond on his behalf.  We understand and appreciate the 
frustration you are experiencing.

As a Floridian and the stateâ€™s chief financial officer, he is concerned 
about the lack of affordability and availability of insurance coverage in 
Florida.  However, CFO Gallagher is not the stateâ€™s insurance commissioner 
and does not have a direct role in rate setting.

Florida law requires all admitted insurance companies to submit their rates 
to the Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR), under the direction of 
Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty, to justify the need for a rate change. 
  The OIR is obligated to review these rates and ensure that they are fair, 
not excessive, and non-discriminatory.  The law does not permit the Office 
of Insurance Regulation to deny a rate increase on the basis the rate 
increase will create a financial hardship for customers of the insurance 
company, even though we understand that higher rates create hardships in 
many cases.

Therefore, each rate filing receives the most careful attention the OIR can 
give to review every component of the filing and to make sure the rates 
being charged are not excessive.   Please be assured the OIRâ€™s actuaries 
closely scrutinize these filings, and if the rate is not justified, it is 
not approved.

Florida law outlines the basic considerations in premium rating for 
property/ casualty lines of insurance.  Some of the items the law requires 
OIR to consider in reviewing rate increases are a companyâ€™s anticipated 
losses, expenses, investment income, adequacy of loss reserves, and cost of 
reinsurance.  Rate increases are not permitted to be used to recoup from 
previous losses, only to prepare for current and future expenses.

We realize this does not resolve your concerns.  However, we hope this 
information helps you better understand how Florida law affects your 
insurance premiums.  Please keep in mind that this Department is 
administrative in nature.  Therefore, we are only capable of enforcing 
existing laws.  Establishing a new law or amending existing laws takes the 
action of our state legislative representatives.  CFO Gallagher and 
Commissioner McCarty can make recommendations to the House and Senate 
legislative bodies and the Governor, but it is the duty of those offices to 
create or amend Florida law.  As such, please contact your state legislators 
to express your specific concerns regarding the existing laws, and to 
propose possible new laws.  If you need assistance locating your 
legislators, please visit the Florida Legislatureâ€™s website at 
www.leg.state.fl.us.

If you have additional questions or need assistance with a future insurance 
concern, please feel free to contact our toll-free Consumer HelpLine at 
1-800-342-2762 in state, or 850-413-3132 out-of-state.  An Insurance 
Specialist will be happy to assist you.  Current information on insurance, 
banking, and financial issues is available through our free Consumer eViews 
Newsletter.  If you are interested, you may subscribe by visiting our

Subject:	[*] Disaster Fund

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I have written to your brother, the president, about my idea but of course I haven't heard a thing about it.  Maybe I can put the idea into your head and you can toss it around.
I live in Pinellas  County where the sales tax is 7%.  All the counties are different and all the states are different.  Why not raise EVERYONES sales tax by 1% and put that money into a disaster fund somewhere?  When a disaster strikes that state would draw from the fund, no matter the disaster.  This would be fair to everyone and every state.  That 1% would add up in a hurry and that money could ONLY be used for this purpose.  Not to be used for schools, toilet seats or new jets. 
I have been in Florida for 22 years and have always paid my fair share but with the new insurance bill I'll be getting I may have to move out as many others will have to too.  With this new fund the insurance companies could draw from there and possible keep the rates down for everyone.  People that don't carry insurance would also be putting into this fund, not relying on everyone else to fix their house or buy them a new car.  
When I got married 42 years ago, we came here on our honeymoon and I said that I want to die here,,,,,,,,,I love it!!!!!  Well the way things are going right now I don't see that happening.  So please, please, please, think this over and maybe pass it on to the person that could get the ball rolling.  Thank you for your time.

I just read an article that the insurance company I have, Statefarm is going to amend it's rate increase it is asking fr to a higher rate. If this happens we will be moving out of Florida as soon as we can sell our home. I am a fifth generation Floridian who is being run out of Florida by the GREEDY Insurance companies. As it is my parents who own their home and are stuck with Citizens Insurance will be without ANY insurance as of September because the policy has gone from $780....to $1200...to $3200 to $5000!!!!!
 
Virginia Stevans
Floridian & Homeowner for now! 
 
 
 
"He has reviewed State Farm's filing, which the company now intends to
amend because it says the rate increase it asked for isn't high enough
to cover its reinsurance expense.

State Farm had actually asked for two rate hikes -- one, an average 58.8
percent statewide, was to cover the increased cost of reinsurance. The
company will amend this filing. The company is dropping the second
request -- 12.7 percent statewide -- which had been intended to cover
higher storm costs this year."

In particular, the ones most impacted will be those most vulnerable and least able to pay. My previous Citizen’s Windstorm Policy was costing me $7,200/yr with surcharges of $1,206 for a total of $8,406. I have received notice from HomeWise that 

my new premium for windstorm coverage will now be $21,747/yr. That is pushing a 300% increase in premium that they demand be PAID IN FULL UP FRONT before they will even send you a declarations page, or statement of the details of coverage much less acceptance!

 

When I contacted the Office of Ins. Regulation, CFO Tom Gallagher’s office, and the Office of the Consumer Advocate,  I was apprised of the following facts:

 

(1) The insurance industry lobby is extremely powerful in Tallahassee and has been able to push legislation that has removed much of the Ins. Commissioner’s power to regulate

them in the last couple of years.

 

(2) The insurance lobby has been able to keep and inspire a Use and File Law which allows an insurance company to elect whatever premium they wish to charge for a particular coverage such as windstorm.They can also bill their policy holders IMMEDIATELY without state approval of that increase demanding full payment up front. Should the State, at a later time, deny the increase previously charged the policy holders of the State of Fla., the only obligation of the insurer is to refund the difference in premium due the policy holder. The fly in the ointment, however, is that the insurers get to deposit millions and millions of dollars of the citizen’s money into their own accounts 

with the accrual of all interest thereof going into their coffers and not returned to the rightful owners.

 

(3) The insurer has the right to re-appraise the insured property each year and accordingly raise the policy coverage amount reflecting their unchallenged assessment. This also affects the determination of the amount of contents coverage which is automatically set at 50% of the property evaluation figure. For example, if your house is

appraised by them at $580,000 than your contents are valued at $290,000. How many of us have contents worth ½ of the value of your home?

 

(4) If you elect to increase your deductible from 2% to 5% or 10%, than your premium is NOT reduced by a comparable amount to justify the arbitrary premium reduction offered by the insurer. 

 

(5) By law, Citizen’s Ins., the State insurer of last resort must have the most expensive premium for the coverage offered in the State of Fla. Therefore, if these outrageous premiums are allowed, then Citizen’s must match or be slightly higher than any others allowed for admitted insurers within the State and must raise rates accordingly.

 

(6) If you have a mortgage on your property, you are legally and contractually bound to have all necessary insurance required by the mortgage entity. Failing to have that coverage, the mortgage entity has the right to call that mortgage in or to even foreclose 

on the property.  What is an elderly person living on social security of $15,000/$20,000

a year in the same home for 30 yrs, which has esculated in value and taxes, supposed to do? He’s already trying to decide how to spend his available moneys between his medicine or food. You may say,  he will have to downsize and sell. Of course, you are now confronted with the prospect of having to by something else with triple the real estate taxes because he lost the advantage of the 3% increase rule due on his old homestead residence. What does he do, lose his home to the mortgage company or in foreclosure? Can you imagine what this will do for for the real estate market coupled with the interest rate increases, condo glut, soaring insurance costs! Foreclosures should 

skyrocket.

 

(7) Insurers have been able to cry poverty and distress because they have been allowed to diversify their corporate structures from, for example, State Farm Ins. Co. to State Farm Ins. Co of Fla. so they can show legislators and regulators that they have sustained great losses rather than surpluses overall nationwide. They can then make their case for increases more reasonable.

 

(8) You have no right of choice or option but to accept the insurer’s inflated offer, other than to go bare if you don’t have mortgage obligations. Citizen’s Ins. will not take you back if another insurer is willing to assume the risk. There is no competitive market here to control premiums. Take it or leave it!

 

(9) Ninety percent of all hurricane losses last year were less than $25,000. When you factor in the cost of  windstorm coverage and the deductible, that’s like having no coverage at all.

 

 

What are the fixes:

 

(1) Make our legislators keenly aware of the fact that the Use and File law is grossly inequitable and unfair to the Citizens of the State of Fla. and do away with it. It would 

be fair to mandate billing only after an increase has been approved by the State. Failing that, at least all interest accrued thereof is the property of the policy holder and not the insurer and should be returned to him with his premium adjustment..

 

(2)  Create a Catastrophic State Reinsurance Fund to replace the ultra expensive offshore reinsurance funds currently causing the insurers to escalate their premiums so aggressively. This should be financed by a State surcharge spread over the entire State so that it helps lower everyone’s premiums and doesn’t fall so heavily on certain counties.

Not an easy task for less hurricane prone county legislators to swallow, yet fairer to the general population at large.  

 

(3) Make the insurers offer installment payment options for the asked premiums instead of asking the already stressed policy holders for full payment up front. The only other option for some of these people would be to take out additional loans, which they could ill afford, to satisfy their insurance and mortgage obligations.

 

(4) Tell the insurers that if they want to write any other types of coverage in the State of Fla., they must also write windstorm coverage and spread the cost of business to their other lines of insurance state wide or nationwide.

 

(5) Eliminate the Fla. corporate loophole allowing them to call themselves a separate Fla. ins. co. instead of a national ins. co. They could not then bypass certain financial proofs and justifications they would otherwise have to meet in order to attain increases.  

 

(6) Make the insurer’s premiums more accurately reflect the amount of deductible you choose when you increase it.

 

This is a problem that will affect all the citizens of the State of Fla. in one way or another now or in the immediate future. Maybe, you might want to do some further research into 

this as it is sure to be a hot button election issue with the Ins. Commissioner running for 

Governor.

Subject:	Florida's Official English Law

It is my understanding that the constitution of the State of Florida established "English as the official language for the State of Florida" in 1988, as per Article II, Section 9 (a); and that the Florida legislature has…"the power to enforce this section (a) by appropriate legislation"---but, has failed to do so since this law was adopted seventeen years ago. Data on file shows that 85.5% of Floridians voted in favor of the State of Florida's Official English law.

Data shows that there are 134 languages spoken in Florida today. Why would we try to accommodate them all (other countries don't) by extra taxpayer costs in a designated English speaking state and country? Data also shows that 46%, close to half, of all Florida residents cannot speak English well. This seems illogical.

I respectfully request, as a citizen of Florida, that as Governor of Florida, you use the power of your office to mandate Florida's Official English Law as expressed in Article II, Section 9, of the sate constitution, to be fully enforces and protected, for the logical clarity of a state's and nation's identity and function.

Thank you.

I am writing to ask when you are going to do something about the 
outrageous premiums being charged by this Company!   Small businesses 
will not be able to cover these costs and I, as a senior citizen living 
on a fixed income, have been forced to shell out one thousand dollars 
to help reimburse the reserves of our condo association, because our 
association is looking at an insurance premium above and beyond 
anything we have had to pay in the past.  Our maintenance costs will 
increase by $100.00 next year and this, coupled with rising gas and oil 
prices, electricity, telephone and just about everything else will soon 
force me out of my home and out of the State of Florida.

Please let me hear from you as to what you propose to solve these 
problems for me and the rest of the Senior Citizens in Florida.

tank you,

dear governor,I am a 100% disabled veteran,therefore I live on a fixed income.I have been buying homeowners insurance for 43 years, in that period of time I have one claim. I am not a native floridan but  i have lived here about 40 years. i have just received my quote from "CITIZENS". I have gone from $1400.00 to $3529.00 a year, this is a 250% increase.In the last 6 years, I have not received a 3% raise a year in my benefits. I have called my bank, they sell insurance,theyalso hold my mortage. Iwas told that the only quote they could give me would be from "CITIZENS". I have called several other agents,they tell me the same thing.I can remember hearing that monoplies are not legal. If "CITIZENS" is not a nmonoply i don't know what is.A lot of the insurance companies do not want to sell homeowners in Florida, but they are allowed to sell auto and other products, this should be illegal.The "BIG" picture is that everone is going to be affected by this circumstance' including "TOURISTS". Rents,motels, grocery stores etc. "ALL" businesses will have to "RAISE" their prices.If you, AS GOVERNOR", allow this to happen, you are a poor example of a sharing & caring "GOVERNOR".How long do you think that people living on fixed incomes can survive? I do hope that you read this e-mail, I know that you have probably have or will receive thousands of e-mails regarding this matter.

Dear Governor Bush:

Dear elected officials,

Please help people living on fixed incomes not become "Street People" most of us just can't afford anymore increases. FEMA needs to delve into paying for the Hurricane victims. Or figure out some sort low interest payments of some other kind. we are the richest country in the world and are always willing to help foreign countries with plight for the poor. How about helping our own for a change. I moved to Florida 2.5 years ago. My new Villa that I had planned on staying in until death, I can no longer afford,because of increasing property taxes and home owners insurance. My home is forsale and I am going back up north to Maryland. Maybe Mr. Sarbanes and MS. Mikulski will work for me. They have tried in the past done so. Since me and millions of other Americans pay your salaries(and you in 
Congress) just gave yourselves a big raise, while the rest of us are just trying to live and make ends meet.Finally, I think you should listen to your constituants instead of Big Business that don't care about even their employee's. Oh yes please stop outsourcing our products to countries that have 24/hr day sweatshopS and are inhumane like China. I really think this country will go to hell in a hand basket if you elected officials don't take action NOW!!

As a taxpayer and voter, I'm writing to urge you to consider long verdue sentencing reform as a means of balancing the state budget.  Incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders cannot be justified from either a fiscal or public health perspective.  Jail cells and criminal records do not cure addiction.  Non-violent drug offenders are eventually released, with dismal job prospects due to criminal records.  Turning drug users into unemployable ex-cons is a senseless waste of tax dollars.
 
Please take a leadership role and add your voice to the growing nationwide movement towards alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders.  As long as there exists an unmet need for effective drug treatment on demand, it makes no sense to continue the "lock 'em up" approach, an approach that has done little other than give the former land of the free the highest incarceration rate in the world.  The tax dollars wasted on incarcerating Americans with substance abuse problems would be better spent on effective drug treatment.  
 
Thank you for showing leadership on this issue.  Miriam Greeberg

I wrote you a letter dated April 10, 2006 along with a petition signed by approximately 300 residents of our condo complex.
 
You answered my letter regarding the rising cost of homeowner's insurance. 
You told me to contact the CFO which I did and it did me absolutely no good at all.  This issue has gone far beyond where I live
it has spread over the entire state of Florida.  The only people that are quite are those who have so much money it doesn't matter or the MANY who have now lost their homes and left the state.
 
I have sent an email to every Florida state representative (121) do they care no they don't care.
 
I have sent letters to the State representatives do they care not really
 
Please look at a few of the terrible things that are going on in this state. 
Go to TBO.com and there are pages of people who are going to lose their homes
their jobs, their business's etc.
My insurance has pulled out of the state, now I have to find someone to write 3 insurance policies.
If I can't get them I will have to go without insurance
 
You stated in your letter (dated 5/30/06) that you wished you could be of more assistance well Mr. Governor you can and
I sure hope you do before it's to late for millions of people in the state of Florida.

Dear Mr. Bush,
              I am writing to you on behalf of my husband and myself. We moved here from California in 2003 and bought the houseof our dreams in Port Saint Lucie. Things were a bit rough at first with employment and we ended up having to file bankruptcy in 2004 , but every problem leads to an opportunity!!! My husband got laid off for the 3rd time and I said that's it he needed to go out on his own and start up his business and do things the way he was taught in L.A. Our business is called The Audio/Visual Guy,Inc. and has become a very successful home based business! We do the adopt a street program in our neighborhood and are very active with community beautification.
Now the reason i'm writing............2 months ago my Cobra health insurance ran up (I work for my husband now) so on to searching for medical insurance. We were denied from several companies due to the fact that my husband was just diagnosed with high chlolesterol!! Along with the other millions of people!! I was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse in 2004 along with millions of other people and take no medicine for it! Neither one of us smoke etc. So finally we get medical insurance but .......$1125.00 a month for a decent policy!!! O.K. we accept that and pay it.We have shutters, a hurricane double insulated garage door and a hurricane front door that we put in all withine the past year, At the end of August we are having a Generac with a 500 gallon propane tank installed, as well as solar panels afor our pool and solar hot water heater and a metal roof!!!! All for better of our property in case anything happens?? Today I received a home owners insurance bill for $4,158.68!!! Last year it was1,468.14. Why??? Please help us. We pay business license fees, sales tax fees, unemployment taxes, payroll taxes we abid by all the rules!
We are just trying to make ends meet and have a decent living but know our mortgage will increase approx. $250.00 per month!!! We do not feel that we should have to help bail out Citizens Insurance or feel that any increase is justified. Many years go by without any policy being collected on and just because of a couple of rough years does not give anyone the right to up a bill by $2600.00.

Mr. Bush,
 
Both myself, my husband and my 18 year old daughter are registered Republicans.
We are a family of five residing in South Florida, where all of our children have been born and raised. We chose to send our children to private schools for their elementary years and now have one that just graduated with an IB Diploma and a 100% Bright Futures scholarship, though it will still cost our family $6000 to $8000 a year to send her to college for housing, meal plans and the cost to do a load of laundry at the University of Florida.  So thank you Florida Lottery for that benefit and for her hard work to get there.
 
Because our household income is just over 100,000 a year we are considered the middle class Americans who get the least amount of benefits.
 
Just this month I received notice that my real estate taxes will be increasing, my electric bill was $600, which was $150 a month more than last year, my insurance premium on my home went from $3400 a year to $5400 a year and my auto insurance just recently increased $170.00 a month more.  My middle child will begin driving next year and in South Florida it is my understanding that this will cost me $3600 a year even if he doesn't have a vehicle, and then the health insurance costs for our family because we don't work for the state or a large corporation is $700 a month, another out of pocket expense.
 
My husband owns his own A/C company, fighting the competition from the big corporations and I am a real estate paralegal, trying to keep from being the person that gets laid off in the stagnate market due to higher interest rates and the rising concern that the economy is wavering, thus people are not rushing out to buy homes.  
 
I could not purchase my home again at our income bracket and pay real estate tax rate as it would cost me $800 a month in real estate tax alone, along with that, the increases as I noted above just this month and the rising price of gas I am at a loss.  
 
Employers cannot increase the salaries fast enough make ends meet and I cannot even ask for a raise this year due to the market. I will instead of saving for retirement and my children's college education, will taking everything I earn and then some to pay the rising costs to live in this wonderful state.
 
Please explain how we are supposed to endure the excessive and increasing costs to live in So. Florida and what you plan to do to help us middle class, small business owners and working citizens of this state.  We need a drastic plan before our heads are under water.
 
P.S. We are prepared for the next hurricane, but can't afford another increase or expense.  Pray that we don't have need a new roof or one of the kids needs dental work.
 
Frustrated in Delray,   Jonna Kilbourne

Subject:	HOA LIABILITY INSURANCE IN FLORIDA

Dear Governor and Chief Financial Officer,

I am writing to you both on the behalf of my home
owners association, as their president.  Laurel Run at
Meadowridge is located in Titusville, FL., Brevard
county and operates as a non-profit organization.  As
a newer subdivision, 2002, we have not had insurance
problems in the past and Nationwide Insurance had
taken care of our needs in a reasonable manner. 
Recently we received a notice on non-renewal from
Nationwide and our local insurance agent, Kim Jones,
set out to find us new coverage.  I spoke with her
this afternoon after she went through an exhausting
search for someone to underwrite my HOA.  Bottom-line
our policy went from $261.00/year for general
liability and property coverage to over $2069.00/year
for liability only.  Now, that may not sound so bad in
some areas but this new quote is for a general
liability policy ONLY; absolutely no property coverage
is included.

I have spoken with Minerva Santana in Mr. Gallagher's
office; I have personally gone down my local phone
book and called agents searching for anyone writing
policies only to be turned away.  They tell me if I
had property that could help me but not for a strictly
general liability policy. 

What has happened in Florida?  I know we have had our
share of bad luck storms over the years but that can
only account for property damage coverage and not
general liability, such as my case, just to cover the
HOA in case someone trips on my associations
sidewalks.  

This is out of hand and tearing our wonderful state
apart and I would like answers as to what is honestly
being done about this. Why do we allow companies to
sell lucrative vehicle insurance in this state yet
they don't have to cover homes, properties and
businesses.  Why not tie their hands and make it all
or nothing instead of allowing the huge conglomerates
the ability to make a profit where they deem desirable
while leaving the citizens hung out to dry and praying
nothing bad happens. 


Sincerely,
Allen Harris

With all the complaint and people trying to sell and the Hotels complaints I feel it is very necessary for the State of Florida. If you would go on www.tbo.com and to the hurricane blog site you will see pages of people complaining about their House Insurance and not being able to afford it. To me this is PRICE GOUGING. There is a complaint website especially for this complaint. We need something to be done NOW THIS YEAR THIS MONTH. People who have already come up with the money to pay the 300% increase they should be reimbursed for this years premium paid out.
It says in the laws that you can call a special session: "The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, acting jointly, may also convene the Legislature in special session. A special session may not exceed twenty consecutive days, unless extended beyond such limit by a three-fifths vote of both houses.

The proclamation (known as the “call”) limits the Legislature to specific items of business. The scope of the items specified in a call is known as its “purview.” A bill must be within the purview of the call or receive an extraordinary vote to be considered in a special session.

PLEASE HELP THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE FLORIDA

Dear Governor Bush
 
Please advise what is being done to help us with homeowners insurance. 
 
My daughter just purchased a home in Pasco county 40 miles away from coast and they want to charge her $4,200 for homeowners insurance for a $250,000 home. If she knew this before she would not have bought the new home. Her current home only costs $1,200 for same value. Because here existing ins co does not write in FL and no one else seems to we have to go with Citizens. At this pace she will not be able to make her monthly payments. We are now thinking of canceling the contract we have on the purchase due to the dollar amount of insurance, but don't know what legal action will be taken against us we know we will lose the 10% we put down.
 
Also I am told that my insurance company also is not writing in FL and I may have to switch when my current policy expires.  I am retired on fixed income and will not be able to afford more then I pay now.
 
Please help us before you leave office in getting insurance rates where we can afford them. PLEASE HELP
 
Thank you

Dear Gov Bush:

Please call a special session of the FL legislature to address the insurance crisis.

Something simply has to be done.  The insurance companies will not sell me  fire insurance, liability insurance, or theft insurance unless I also take fantastically expensive, high-deductible wind-damage insurance as well.

There is the smell of collusion amongst the underwriters and the re-insurance companies and only strong legislative action will correct it.

Subject:	Homeowner's Insurance

Mr. Governor:

 

I just moved to Pasco County from Broward thinking that the housing situation here in the Bay area would be better. Very quickly I have realized how wrong I was in my assessment! I bought a brand new house in Land O Lakes, which I should be closing on in the next 2 weeks. During the past week I have been trying to get homeowner’s insurance. To my surprise, the only option I find is Citizens. As you may know the price of this insurance is much higher than other companies.

 

The unfortunate reality is that this will be my only option. For a State that prides itself on friendliness and affordability to the elderly population, it is amazing how many stories I have heard of retirees that had to drop their insurance coverage because buying it would have meant having less to eat or less prescription medications to improve their quality of life. In my case, I have the means to buy from Citizens and I’m sure I will. However, there are many others that are not that lucky.

 

I understand that your term ends this year; however, it seems to me that part of your legacy to this state should be resolving this problem. THIS IS A CRISIS.

 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Subject:	[*] Home Owners Insurance In Florida For  Mobile Home Owners

Dear Mr. Bush,
      
My family has lived at here for over 20 years, we are residents of Duval County Jacksonville Fl. I am really concerned and really do not have any clue where to get Home Owners Insurance for our home, we recieved a letter from Nationwide Ins.Co.as of Sept.24,2006 we 
would be a non renew policy.We have been loyal customers of Nationwide for over 20 years and never had a claim.I feel that this is totally wrong for the state to let these Insurance companies pull out of florida and leave us without any type of coverage for our families and homes. As of now we pay around$700.00 a year for a 150,000.00 policy,the only company that I have found that will even insure us is Citizens, They want 1,600.00 for only 50,000.00
worth of coverage .I can"t Believe that a state organized company would be allowed to charge these prices for such little insurance. How are families suppose to pay these premiums??????Not to mention horrible coverage. I dont  know if you are  aware  of this crisis in Florida ???? But i know that there are many more people out there in our situation.So our only choice is not to have insurance , so if our home burns down or a hurricane hits our area our family will be sitting on the grass outside. There seems to be that there should be something that our government can do to help the people out in Florida that are faced with the same crisis that our family is faced with.Even if the insurance Co were able to offer homeowners a Fire policy or a Contents policy similiar to a rental policy this would at least be better than nothing,I was told that they can"t write a policy without wind  coverage . If you could please give me any information on this or help I would appreciate it.
Our home  in my opinion is in a safer area than some. We are on the westside of Jacksonville in the country.The risk in our area is alot less than someone who lives at the beaches.

Subject:	Re: Wholesale Insurance company scamming

Dear Governor Bush, Your Honor:
 
My wife and I have been struggling to acquire insurance for our home after our insuror, Balboa, has terminated their underwriting in the state of Florida.
 
We have spent a lot of time on the internet and on the phone calling many insurors. The answers are all the same. Either they won't underwrite a home older than 2002, or they won't underwrite if one has filed a claim due to last year's hurricane. 
 
Yesterday we had our home inspected by a certified home inspector in anticipation of having to provide that type of document in order to get insured by some company out there.
 
We are lucky because my wife is still working at Disney and I am receiving disability for my severe hearing loss. Others who aren't as fortunate are struggling even more under the latter aforementioned prejudices imposed and implimented by the insurance companies. 
 
I can pretty much read between the lines herein. They are applying pressure to homeowners so they can get an increase on their rates. This amounts to a petty blackmailing and black balling scheme perpetrated by these insurors upon the old and those who have suffered devastation.
 
Again, we were lucky after the hurricanes did their damage. Our insuror, Balboa covered the damage that was wrought upon our home. We have a new roof, new walls and new paint on the exterior of the house.
 
We passed the certified inspection with flying colors and are now awaiting the inspector's paperwork.
Again, others may not be so fortunate.
 
I am imploring you and the state of Florida to enact laws that will protect consumers of home insurance who have been struck by natural disasters.
 
Thank you for your time and for your kind attention.
 
Respectfully,

Subject:	INSURANCE CRISIS

Governor Bush,
 
I have sent you, the candidates, the House of Representatives and anyone else out there in the state of Florida seeking help as well as many other Floridians.  We need HELP, and we need HELP NOW!  People are being bombarded with extremely high premium costs for homeowners insurance and no one is helping us.  
 
For me personally, I am on disability and receive a monthly check, of which, barely covers my living expenses.  Yesterday I sat down with reality and realized that I would have to totally give up my September disability check to Citizens.  I have absolutely no choice in the matter because either I pay it or I am forced into lender's insurance through my bank which is even more.  We are not talking about a multi-million dollar home here, its a single-wide trailer with an add-on and coverage of $15,000.00.
 
It doesn't stop there because then I still have my September mortgage, association fees, FP&L, gas for car, food, PET Food, medical supplies, medication, car insurance, phone, etc.  Where the heck do I find the money to pay my September bills?  How do I survive?  Is there a manual out there to "Survive The Crisis of the Homeowners Insurance", like there is a manual to "Survive A Hurricane"?
 
Florida is going to be in the same situation like the low-income families in New Orleans when people had to evacuate their homes and they couldn't buy food or supplies because they didn't receive their monthly checks.  Then you'll see Florida on national TV again begging for help because we can't eat, take our meds, and so on and forced on the streets to live homeless because of our homeowners insurance premiums.
 
You can not turn your back on us Governor Bush, you need to help us and show us you care about this state and the effect homeowners insurance has on the people.  Call a special session and get this issued resolved.  Force the insurance companies to reinstate the policy holders at the same rate until Florida comes up with a better plan to protect the homeowner.   Force Citizens to honor the insurance premiums that people paid before they were canceled.  If we have to all go into one pot at least let it be fair to everyone.
 
Perhaps you will have some sleepless nights when that major hurricane is brewing out in the Atlantic or Gulf and your sitting there hoping it will pass up Florida.  But then there will be those days before a major hurricane as you go on TV and ask the people to evacuate their homes, get needed supplies and so on and we say "oh sure Jeb, with what food, what gas, where can I go, all my money is with Citizen's." 
 
Right now I ride around with a sign in my car telling people NOT TO VOTE in the primary election until the homeowner's insurance issue is resolved.  This will continue until we get some results.  
 
Help Us And Help Us Now!

Subject:  Windstorm insurance and taxes
                We are in a housing crisis - what we can do about it
 
            While we rejoice in the  dramatic housing value  increase seen in the past couple of years,  we are  concerned about the  skyrocketing  insurance premiums. Some residents on fixed income  can’t afford the  windstorm premiums which can easily exceed $5,000/year  and it gets worse  when the basic fire insurance premiums have nearly  doubled over the past year with more increases coming.   
            Maybe it’s time to sell, take our huge profit and move somewhere else?  But this gives us another problem. Who will buy our house even at  $550,000, a drastic reduction from the $650,000 seen just a few months ago when the prospective buyer faces a $10,000 tax bill and a gigantic  $5,000 plus insurance cost?  This tax is a huge 300% increase over what many of us are paying,  thanks to  the 3% tax appraisal cap our wise legislature gave us some years ago.  The new buyer faces a tax appraisal based on what he pays  and that's the $500,000 plus.  There are people who can afford to pay these high expenses but they must be making salaries well exceeding $100,000/year  or have deep pockets.  But there are fewer and fewer of them. Employers have a problem attracting new employees because of these costs and especially the massive windstorm insurance.  This leads to further depressed housing values and worse still, a potential economic recession for the area as  employers,  unable to attract people to work for them pack up and move themselves thereby placing even more houses on the market.  
            This is a serious problem for all of us  and it’s time for all of us individually and collectively do take strong  and immediate action.  Palmetto Bay is a great community and fortunately, we have strong leaders in our mayor and others who already are working hard  to help  alleviate these problems.  
            What can be done?  The insurance companies help themselves by simply raising our premiums while silently praising the hurricanes all the way to their bank. We must  force our state insurance commissioner to switch allegiance from the insurance industry to us, the  citizens who  he is  supposed to serve.
             Our municipal  leaders, especially Miami –Dade Metro Commissioners  smile privately as they see tax revenues rise  while they take great credit for not raising our millage rates. It’s time for us to ask our leaders what they are doing with the extra money from the super high new taxes being collected. For example,  if we sold our house, the local governments would receive  about $10,000 more  tax revenue  from the new owner and that’s each year.  As more of us sell our houses for many reasons over time, the  tax revenues from this gradual process  can give significant new money to our local government.  Unless we reign them in,  they will just spend what they can collect while we see our property values stagnate or decline even further. 
 
What can we do about this?
            Plenty can be done and fast.  These are some of the options available  which could dramatically and quickly alleviate the housing cost crisis and secure our property values once again.
 
Insurance 
There are two options. One is for the federal government to  create  a national disaster insurance plan similar to its existing flood insurance or combine the two risks into one policy.  A second option is for the Florida insurance industry and  State of Florida work together to create a two tier system whereby  the insurance companies offer high deductibles (such as $75,000) disaster coverage while the State controlled Citizens Property Insurance Company   offers coverage  below that high deductible but also with its own deductible.  This would be statewide, not just for  storm prone areas  with premiums based on individual risk factors,  as is normal for insurance.  The state could provide  assistance  for low income families but make coverage mandatory.  Although there is a cost to this, there also is a saving because  resulting  from a drastic reduction in  tax  funded  public assistance now costing the governments billions.  
 
Taxes
The local municipal governments must realize  there are adverse consequences to simply collecting and spending the windfall tax revenues it is increasingly receiving as property owners sell their low tax appraised houses to new owners who must pay  tax based on what they pay for the houses. These consequences include depressed property values and at best a stagnant local economy and possibly an area recession.  The local leaders should recognize this problem by placing a cap on the amount taxes can be raised  to the new buyer.  
             What can we as individuals do?  It is urgent that we communicate our concerns and specific recommendations to the people who can do something about it.   To help you do this, I have attached a list of state and federal elected representatives including their names, addresses,  fax numbers and in some cases, email addresses.  You should get busy telling these people what you think and above all, tell them that they will no longer get your next vote unless  they declare this a top priority and get the job done. Specifically, I  would urge the Governor to call a special session of the state legislature to address these issues.
            What can our local Palmetto Bay government do?   Our officials are already communicating with state and federal officials. But I suggest  that Palmetto Bay declare  this a crisis by issuing a proclamation intended to bring added public local and national focus on this problem.
            Folks,  it’s time to act to preserve our great community for what it has become and make it an even better one. Shirley says it’s time to stop  complaining. Let’s start today to be heard.

Subject:	Save Our Homes

Dear Honorable Governor Bush,
 
I am writing you to express my opinion related to the Save Our Homes matter.  I was born and lived in Florida for 48 years before living outside of the State of Florida for the last 1 - 2 years.  We will be moving back to Florida and have found a significant issue related to property taxes within the county (Broward) where we believe that we will live.  Unfortunately, the property taxes have skyrocketed because of moving out of the area and we are forced to start all over the Save Our Homes rules.
 
It seems very unfair to me that after living in Florida for 48 years and paying real estate taxes for over 25 years that there should be some provision in legislation which would allow some grandfathering issues such as mine.  For example, if you live in Florida and return within 2, 3 or 5 years there should be some allowance rather than having to start all over again.
 
It seems very unfortunate that a life long resident of Florida is severely punished monetarily for moving away for a short period of time.  I do not believe that this would cause a significant effect upon any budgetary matters by city or county since most people are moving to Florida for the first time anyway.
 
I have contact the property appraiser's office within Broward County, but as they indicated that it is a legislative matter as they are only following the rules that have been adopted.  In addition, I was informed by a Florida representative that certain issues were addressed in the legislative session but were not passed.  They will be providing additional information in the future to me.
 
Thank you for your consideration and any additional assistance that you may be able to provide related to this matter.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] Status of HB 209

Dear Governor Bush:
 
    I have tried to learn from the State House Clerk's office what is the status of HB 209, the repeal of the intangible personal property tax.  However, the House staffers with whom I have spoken cannot offer any explanation.   HB 209 was passed and enrolled on April 27, according to the legislative links on MyFlorida.  According to the schedule posted on your official web page, this bill is the only remaining outstanding item from the 2006 session.  It appears to me that the bill has not yet been transmitted to you.
 
    Is there any way to learn what is going on here?  Can you require the legislature to send you a bill?  Is there some reason unknown to the public and House staffers in the Clerk's office why the enrolled bill would have been delayed?  Do you plan to sign the bill?
 
    The reason for my interest is that I have an out-of-state attorney friend who advise several clients about tax and estate planning matters, and he has heard of the pending repeal.
 
Thank you.
 
Sincerely,
Robert Koch

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I wanted to take the time to thank you personally for my recent appointment to the FICCIT Council. I am truly honored that you have entrusted me with such a task and having recently attended my first FICCIT meeting, I want to assure you that I do not take this appointment lightly and will work to the fullest on behalf of a very vulnerable segment of Florida's population. 
 
On an unrelated note: Are you aware of any move at the legislative level to address "loopholes" in the FMLA law? I would be curious to know whether anyone has looked at how this law has been abused by some and how crippling it has been for some small State Programs and I am sure some small businesses who do not have the financial means to keep hiring in order to carry out workloads impacted by the actions of those who go on to use the FMLA blanket protection to remain absent almost indefinitely. I would love to know whether this issue has been raised by anyone else.
 
Best Regards,
 
Dominique Fethiere

Subject:	Your help is needed

I understand your office is being flooded with cry's of help from the homeowners of Florida because of the insurance industry's upcoming hike of 71 percent. Most Floridians are considering moving because they can no longer afford homeowners insurance here.
 
My sister is the only family I have left. The two of us moved to Ocala three (3) years ago, purchasing separate homes.  Now she is contemplating moving out of Florida, stating she can no longer afford to live here. I moved to Ocala from Miami where the cost of living was too high.
 
I am disabled and cannot afford to make another move, due to finances as well as my poor health. Besides, I love it here in Ocala. 
 
I will be placed in the position of not being able to afford insurance, plain and simple. May, 2006 my homeowners insurance went up almost 40 percent and now I am facing another increase. 
 
The citizens of Florida depend on our elected officials to help us and protect us from any and all impending doom. Lately, it seems we have been forgotten and expected to fend for ourselves.
 
I do not want to lose my home, nor do I want to be forced to leave Florida. I have lived in this great state for over 44 years.
 
Please help us. The insurance industry needs guidance and I feel in my heart, you are just the man to protect the people.

Dear Governor Bush,
I must say I have to agree with all of the letters attached below.
My home is 15 miles from the Gulf, I'm not sure how high above sea-level I am, but I know you are winded when you climb the hill I live on. Several of my neighbors on our hill have had their insurance dropped, and are finding it very difficult to obtain any.
I feel this is unconscionable when they (we) are expected to subsidize in helping those who have floating homes, and sand that has blown away, get things back to where it was before the hurricane hit.

Dear Governor Bush,

I have a home in north Walton County, more than 30 miles from the coast and 200 feet above sea level.   Hurricane insurance on my home has "gone thru the roof" this year.  

While I have no real beef with those willing to risk their own money in extravagant construction on the uncertain sands of south Walton, I do raise a hackle when I'm forced to help subsidize their folly.   

Citizens Property Insurance has become a scam on Florida's more prudent homeowners.    Please do something to rein it in.

JULY 2006 ISSUE 
An Unwise Growth Subsidy?
Insurance
By Mike Vogel

Citizens insures $5 billion worth of construction projects in places many believe are unwise to build. Should Florida homeowners be on the hook for a $74-million condo project?

 

Most attention to Citizens Property Insurance focuses on the insurance coverage it provides to home and condo owners who can’t get insurance in the private market.
Citizens also provides other types of insurance, however — including a type of insurance to developers that critics say stimulates building in high-risk areas and will leave residential policyholders all over the state on the hook for the bill if a storm strikes the projects.

That “builders risk” insurance provides coverage to developers while their buildings are under construction. And the exposure Citizens has under those builders risk policies is growing rapidly — up by some $800 million this year alone. At the end of May, Citizens was covering 5,723 construction projects — condos, single-family homes, commercial buildings — with a total exposure of $5.1 billion.Without Citizens’ writing builders risk coverage, the state could see some of that $5.1 billion in development, and its jobs and economic opportunity, curtailed.

But critics say that by writing coverage in areas that private insurers find too risky, Citizens encourages development where it shouldn’t occur. And it all but guarantees that when the projects are done, the owners will wind up having to get their homeowners insurance from Citizens. That thwarts, rather than advances, the state’s goal of shrinking what has become Florida’s largest insurer.

In addition, because Citizens can assess non-Citizens policyholders everywhere in Florida to cover its losses, inland homeowners could pay more than what they already do to cover losses of coastal developers building projects the private market won’t cover.As with Citizens windstorm homeowners policies, the builders risk coverage involves properties in high-risk coastal areas. One builders risk policy covers a $74-million condo under construction on the beach. (Citizens is prohibited by law from identifying its customers.) Earlier this year, 1,000 of Citizens’ policies were for more than $1 million each, and the 10 biggest projects Citizens insures total $447 million in exposure.Geographically, Citizens’ heaviest risk is in southeast Florida, where it has $2.1 billion in vulnerabilities, and northwest Florida, where it has $1.3 billion in exposure. Typically required by lenders, builders risk has a sliding scale of vulnerability for an insurer — almost nothing when a project is just coming out of the ground but a large risk in the final days of construction.Like traditional homeowners insurance [“Breaking Point,” June, FloridaTrend.com], builders risk has gotten expensive and scarce after eight Florida hurricanes in two years. “It’s not so much that they won’t write, but the pricing is … there’s sticker shock,” says Matt Wester, agent relations administrator for the Florida Surplus Lines Service Office, a state-mandated non-profit association of agents who sell the specialty insurance products that fall under the surplus lines designation. High-priced projects, for which insurers turn to the reinsurance markets for support, are particularly tough to insure, he says.Pat Chouinard, a vice president and insurance broker with Amwins Brokerage of Florida in Tampa, says private carrrier coverage that cost 30 to 40 cents per $100 of value a year ago now costs as much as $1.50 per $100. A few carriers have stopped writing new builders risk coverage that includes windstorm insurance in Southeastern coastal states. Noting the condo buildings proposed for Tampa, Chouinard says, “You just wonder, who’s going to write the coverage on those?”

Builders risk coverage that used to cost 30 to 40 cents per $100 of value a year ago, now costs up to $1.50 per $100, says insurance broker Pat Chouinard.

Unlike Citizens, with its $74-million exposure on a single property, private sector insurers usually layer coverage on large projects, with different carriers taking different pieces of the risk — one taking, say, the first $5 million in losses, another the next $5 million.The Florida Insurance Council, an insurance industry group, has urged the state to get Citizens out of the builders risk business in high-hazard areas. “If Citizens is the only source for this coverage, it will be the only insurer available for the homes or businesses when they are completed,” according to a Florida Insurance Council report in February. “These are structures that are essentially uninsurable and should not be built.”The state’s insurance consumer advocate, Steve Burgess, says Citizens might want to consider the advisability of continuing builders risk insurance. “I would like to see the policymakers take a look at it and let every stakeholder bring forward their arguments. When you talk about $5 billion of exposure, I think it’s worth a look.”There is precedent for Citizens to leave a market in which the surplus lines industry offers coverage. The Legislature this year required Citizens, beginning in 2008, to stop insuring homes that are valued at more than $1 million. The state was trying to lower Citizens’ exposure to expensive properties [“Too Many Mansions?” February 2005, FloridaTrend.com].Citizens’ board supported eliminating coverage for the $1 million-and-up market and in a meeting in late June was scheduled to consider getting out of the builders risk business in high-risk areas. Citizens spokesman Justin Glover acknowledges that “eliminating coverage would be a way to reduce exposure.”

Mr. Bush,
 
We are writing to you to request something be done about our horrific home owners' insurance problem.  The skyrocketing cost of home owners insurance is devastating economically, emotionally, and financially to many home owners in Florida.  It is way past time to do something about this.  How can you in good conscience not call a special session of the legislature to address this problem?
 
We personally will work to defeat any member of the legislature running in Florida from being elected unless this crisis is resolved to the satisfaction of the population trying to live in this beautiful State.
 
We look forward to your cooperation in convening a special session to work through this problem and resolve it to the satisfaction of all in this State.

Governor Bush:
   Every day, Florida's resale housing market spirals down, and down, faster, and faster toward ultimate collapse. Do you care? It is quite obvious that you don't.
   The only action that will stop the collapse, if it isn't already too late, is for you to call a special session of the Legislature to pass a State Catastrophe Property Insurance Program with a state wide single per $1,000 of value premium rate. While you sit with your comfortable income and your well to do political friends, the little Floridian is being financially ruined.
   Those thousands of ruined lives, which includes thousands of children, are your fault and will haunt you to your grave unless you are completely soulless.

Subject:	[*] Insurance Crisis and other matters

Dear Governor Bush,

Like many homeowners in Florida, we are being informed that if our 
Insurance Company does renew our homeowners policy we can expect a rate 
increase of nearly 90%.  I live in Cape Coral, Florida, and have a 
number of additional expenses.  They are installing water (city and 
irrigation) and sewerage.  As such, the assessment for such is $19,000 
plus for me.  Then there is the charge of $4,500 due the city within 6 
months.  The charge to pay of another $4,500+ for a licensed plumber to 
disconnect from the old septic system and connect to the new city wide 
sewer system.  So, I must find nearly $10,000 for immediate outlay.  
Then I must come up with $200 in addition per month to offset the cost 
of the installment payment that will be added to my tax bill for the 
next ten years.  Then I have to add the increased cost of my homeowner's 
insurance that may double if it is renewed at all.

Eventually, people who are working and supporting college age children 
and are part of the middle of middle class will not be able to live in 
cities like Cape Coral or Florida.  We are being overwhelmed with costs!

First, an increase of 90% by an insurance company is simply too much.  
Yes, they have had substantial losses due to hurricanes over the last 
two years.  This is why they must spread their risk over a large area so 
that their losses will not overwhelm them.  The State of Florida's 
Office of Insurance regulation is really a joke.  We need a State 
Insurance Commission that can regulate what Insurance Companies can and 
cannot do!  Presently, I have most of my local insurance with 
Nationwide.  I pay my car insurance monthly.  Now, I have been informed 
they can legally charge me interest on my unpaid balance because our 
legislature has allowed such!  When I wrote the Office of Insurance 
Regulation I was told that I must write the legislators.  They could not 
do anything to help me or offer advice.  They are quite useless.

Sir, our state government has failed its citizens.  I am just about to 
be priced out of Florida because of the expenses listed about.  It is 
time for some emergency actions to regulate these insurance companies.  
The State must tell them what insurance they must sell if they wish to 
do business and what they can charge.

Action must be taken immediately.  There is a crisis at hand.  I know 
homeowners who have been canceled and can no longer find coverage! 

Soon Cape Coral will be like Naples.  No one in the Middle Income level 
can afford to live in the city.

Action is needed now...not later.

The Rev. V. Creighton Evans, Jr.

Dear Governor Bush:

Please call a Special Session of the Florida legislature to resolve our
insurance crisis before the Florida economy disintegrates further.  The
condominium I own, at Spinnaker Cove, in Tampa, has seen an increase in the
hazard insurance rate from $36,000 in 2005 to $350,000 in June, 2006.  This
is an increase of over 900%.  Citizen's was our only option for coverage.
We had no coverage while we were awaiting Citizen's slow response.

We expect our elected officials to come up with a way to offer financially
viable options for insurance of condominiums, such as ours, which has been
insured since 1978 with no large claims.  Please help.

Subject:	Home Owners Insurance

To All Elected Officials:

 

As a taxpaying citizen I am thoroughly disgusted by the nightmare insurance has become in the state of Florida.  Insurance companies are constantly raising their rates by obscene amounts (although in the business section most of them also seem to be declaring record profits) and all the politicians seem to say is absolutely nothing. Gee, there’s nothing we can do.  Baloney!

 

Why don’t you establish two types of insurance?  One is standard homeowners for theft, fire, liability and the other is natural disaster coverage for everyone in America!  Get rid of flood insurance and combine it as one whole all inclusive natural disaster coverage policy.  Stop the companies from arguing whether wind, water, whatever caused the damage and cover it – nothing like a good old gee did the chicken or egg come first argument to leave everything screwed up forever. Just as flood insurance rates are regulated, so should the natural disaster coverage be.  True, some areas may be higher, but with everyone in the pot rates could be reasonable for everyone.

 

And for any landlocked state saying we don’t have hurricanes, why should we pay – find me a state that does not ever experience natural disasters of some type.  There are tornadoes, flash floods, excessive rain/snow/hail storms, brush fires, forest fires, earthquakes etc.  This past year the northwest and northeast suffered incredible flooding damage from record rainfalls!  If some ones roof collapses from a record snowfall how is that different from my roof being torn off by a hurricane?   One way or another Mother Nature got mad. Yet, states not affected by hurricanes that experience tornadoes are not being regularly raped by the insurance companies.

 

Enough is enough, get off your lazy behinds and do something!  My insurance company is going to request a 54% after a twenty something increase last year.  I don’t get 54% increases in my pay, why should they?  Along with that, they play silly games.  I called to find out if I could get a discount if I installed hurricane impact windows.  They said no, only shutters count – and only if every opening to the house is shuttered.  Interesting concept.  I guess we call someone to bolt us into the house never to emerge again as you can’t shutter all your doors from the inside. What's more strange is that local legal building code accepts impact resistant glass acceptable, yet here we go again, they get to play loopholes.

 

Don’t any of you have a single solitary sensible thought in your heads and even one iota of human decency and morality to stop this ridiculous and insatiable greed?

 

Many people, and possibly myself, will lose our homes if this craziness is not stopped!

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you with great concern about  the rising cost  of 
Property Insurance in Florida.  We live in Tampa an area called Beach 
Park.
We do live in a flood zone and Citizens Insurance is the only company 
that will insure our home.  WE do not have the luxury of shopping 
around for a better rate.  However;  it seems as though one has no 
choice.  If one's property is older than 35 years you have to go 
through Citizens, If one's property is in the suburbs they claim you 
are in a sink-hole area this is becoming a serious problem.  It seems 
as though
we Floridians have no choice and whatever the Insurance Companies are 
asking it gets granted no matter how much the increase in our premiums 
are.  This is not fair to us residents and  we feel as there is no 
resolution in the matter.  There are so many houses on the market
because people cannot afford the  increase of premiums and the 
taxes(another problem).
We live in a modest house and we are paying $4000.00 for both flood and 
regular insurance.  Citizens is wanting to increase premiums even more 
perhaps 40-70% as well as all the other insurance companies such as 
State Farm & Nationwide!  My husband makes a decent salary
of 65,000.00 a year and we seem to be drowning between real-estate 
Taxes of 7000.00/year, Health Insurance $6800.00/year,House Insurance 
4,000.00/year it does not leave much to raise a family on?!  Allowing 
these insurance companies to continue raising there premiums is going 
to make MANY homeowners lose their homes and the rate of foreclosures 
will increase.
Governor Bush,  I have ALWAYS respected and admired you as you have 
done such a fine job with our State.  Your compassion truly shows in 
your work.  I know that you will soon leave us as Governor,  please lay 
a foundation to help resolve this devastating problem we as Floridians 
are having to face.  We love living here in Florida and would hate to 
be forced to move out of State.

With Much Respect,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I thought the following information would be of interest to you.
 
My husband, Bill Taylor, is the Broadcast Services Supervisor for the City of Gainesville. In this capacity, he is responsible for providing the citizens of Alachua County access to state and local government programming.  
 
Additionally, as members of the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors, Bill and his department have been selected as one of four national finalists for NATOA's 21st Annual Government Awards in the category of "Excellence in Government Programming"!  In his category, he is the only finalist from Florida but Tallahassee is a finalist as well in their category.  Good for Florida!
 
Bill is very concerned that Florida's legislators are trying to enact a bill that would eliminate local government's ability to continue to negotiate local telecommunications franchise agreements. Such legislation would deal a mighty blow to local government broadcasting by inhibiting their ability to provide the very excellence for which they are being honored.  Without the capital grants available through the local franchise agreements, excellence in government broadcasting would be severely affected. Please use your considerable influence to inform the legislators in both Tallahassee and Washington of the danger of such legislation.

The Capitol, 400 S. Monroe St.

Dear Governor Bush:

The Florida legislature and the state insurance board’s  failure to take 
action to protect its citizens against the horrendous rise in 2006 
property insurance rates is irresponsible. 

I received a notice that Homewise Insurance  was assuming my Citizens wind 
coverage policy. Then two weeks later I received notice that they were 
increasing the rate by 99%!  When I checked with my agent, she tells me 
that as long as a private insurance company offers to buy a policy, the 
owner can no longer get Citizens coverage, regardless of how much the 
assuming company charges.   They could increase the rate 500% and I would 
either have to pay it, or go without insurance.

She also informed me that several large insurance companies are continuing 
to write property insurance in Florida, but are refusing to write wind 
coverage. 

The impact of allowing these incidious rates to continue will be far more 
costly to Florida’s citizens than the cost of continuing Citizens Property 
Insurance. We are already hearing about the Snowbirds-upon which a lot of 
our economy depends- deciding to sell their Florida property and change to 
other states which are more affordable, notably Arizona and Texas. Now 
even several of my full time resident neighbors are considering the same 
thing! If this becomes a trend, property values will plummet and so will 
tax revenues , jobs, and incomes. 

Action MUST be taken, and swiftly. My request to you is:

1.	Introduce legislation requiring any insurance company wanting to write 
property insurance in Florida to also write wind coverage on that 
property. 2.	Introduce legislation to require any company that takes over 
a Citizens policy to agree that any increase in premium will not exceed 
20% of the most recent Citizens premium, and premium increases will not 
exceed 20% per year thereafter. If they refuse to do that, they should not 
be allowed to assume the Citizens policy. 3.	Make these laws retroactive 
to the date the companies took over the Citizens policies.

Please advise me of you opinion and any intended actions. Thank you for 
your consideration




Sincerely,

Subject:	[*] Special Risk Membership

Dear Sir,
I am writing to you to make a request that you consider adding Department of 
Corrections Classification Officers,Senior Classification Officers and 
Classification Supervisors to the Special Risk Membership under s.121.0515.  
The criteria under section 2 states in part, a member, to be designated as a 
special risk member, must meet the following criteria:  (e) community based 
Correctional Probation Officer.  Classification officers were Correctional 
Probation Officers in the institutions until we went through Reorg and our 
titles changed.  There are still alot of us who continue our CPO 
certification as Auxillary CPO.  We were purposely removed from the special 
risk membership even though we have never received high risk retirement.  
This does not seem fair to us who have 75% contact with inmates in 
correctional facilities/institutions as required by s.121.0515 (2) (f).  We 
deliver bad news to inmates on a daily basis and without pepper spray, 
handcuffs and radios as protection aids.  We hold progress reviews and 
interview inmates in our offices without security escorts to discuss 
transfers, discipline, gain time ratings and other things that can cause an 
inmate to become upset and possibly try to assault us.  We tell inmates that 
they cannot have a transfer closer to home near their mother and family 
members who are often ill or who cannot travel to visit them. This upsets 
them frequently.  We are present in confinement units and are part of the 
disciplinary hearing team that delivers the penalties of loss of gain time 
and disciplinary confinement to the inmates. Classification Officers process 
visitation forms and decide who can visit the inmate which is a major issue 
for inmates.  The Supervisor as a part of the ICT visits confinement units 
several times weekly and reviews and decides which inmates remain in 
confinement and for how long. They also make decisions regarding visitation 
suspensions due to discipline action.
We visit the compound often and without escort to answer inmates' questions. 
  We decide if an inmate will get all of his potential gain time award on a 
monthly basis which affects his release date.  This too upsets inmates on a 
frequent basis.
I don't think the intent of the legislature regarding special risk 
considered things such as I've mentioned above.  Pharmacists are in the 
special risk membership and they deliver medication from behind a glass 
window.  Unlike Classification they have no direct contact with inmates.
Sir, s.121.0515 (3)(b)2 states in part, when a class is not specifed by the 
Dept. as provided in subparagraph 1 the employing agency may petition the 
state retirement commission for approval in accordance with s.121.23.  Can't 
someone do this on our behalf?
(3)(b)1. states in part, DMS shall specify which current and newly created 
classes of positions under the uhiform classification plan established 
pursuant to chapter 110 entitle the incumbents of positions in those classes 
to membership in the special risk class.
Sir, Classification Officers, Senior Classification Officers and 
Classification Supervisors are a newly created class/position to the Dept. 
of Corrections. I am asking that these positions be classified under special 
risk just like psychological specialists, pharmacists, etc. This is not only 
fair but the right thing to do.
Thank you for considering my request and any future action taken.  No one 
has ever considered us important in the institutional setting and yet we are 
as essential as Security in the prisons.  Without us, the prisons would not 
run smoothly.

Dear Governor,
I know you won't be able to help us anymore soon, but I am trying to get some answers and help from you anyhow. I am a disabled person due to a work related accident. My SS disability is $670. I  live in a MH on my own property for many years but can't  keep it up due to my physical limitations. I have been trying to sell it but now had to take it off the market because I would not know where to go. If I find another place for the money I get out of the sale, my property taxes would be 5 times as high with the new property tax law!!!!! I cannot afford to go anywhere where I won't have any physical upkeep, not even a studio apartment!!! The taxes on a $150,000 place would be $3,000 per year! It would be $ 250 a month and now I haven't even payed my utilities, not to mention food! When I called Hernando County in regards of a break in property taxes for a disabled person, they told me it would come to about $12 a year for that!!! That is not helping very much! Someone has to do something for the Floridians so they can afford to keep living here! My friend in California only pays $ 4,000 per year on taxes for a $ 400,000 home, which means that Florida's property taxes are now TWICE AS MUCH AS IN CALIFORNIA!!!  There really is no justification in this, what is this state trying to do? Only wealthy people are going to be able to live in Florida! I have been a nurse for many years and served my community, now I cannot afford to live here any longer. Some of my nurses friends are planning to move to other states and my best girlfriend who is a middle school teacher just moved to North Carolina because she can't make it here anymore. PLEASE HELP US WITH THIS CRAZY TAX LAW BEFORE YOU LEAVE OFFICE!!!!! You will be remembered forever! Let the snowbirds or people who only have a 2nd residence in Florida pay the high taxes, they can afford them! Thank you for listening, Max

Thanks for the newsletter.  On another unrelated note.
 
The problem with homeowners insurance in this state is reaching crisis proportions.  I am a Nationwide Insurance policy holder and I have experienced a) about 150 percent increases in premiums during the last year or so b) Nationwide has announced increases up to 71 percent the next time around and c) my homeowners insurance premiums NOW EXCEED MY PROPERTY TAXES.        
 
How is a retired person to survive, remain in our home and pay higher and higher premiums that we clearly will not be able to afford in short order?  The only choices we have are to sell our homes, take the profits, buy a smaller home and then have to pay back all the profits into higher property taxes and hope that homeowners insurance in a smaller home are reduced.  Fat chance!!!
 
The other option is clearly to leave the state.  I have a condo in Tennessee that has a) no income tax and b) property taxes assessed at 25 percent of assessed value.  I would prefer to remain in my home, but the odds are getting smaller and smaller.  Unfortunately in this scenario the state of Florida loses, not the homeowners.  The solution to this problem is a choice among poor choices, however, one thing that can be done to alleviate some of the pain is to lobby for a National Disaster Fund that covers states exposed to hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. that is comparable to the National Flood Plan.  
 
I strongly urge that you and your cabinet recognize the disaster scenario that lies ahead if homeowners are being evicted from their homes because of the excessive cost of insurance premiums in this state.  My wife and I have lived in Florida for 10 years, we love it here and came here for all the reason that seem to be evaporating before our very eyes.  But, given the choices, we may be forced to move to another state.  Too bad.

Subject:	[*] Outrageaous Property Taxes and Insurance Rates

As a long term Florida resident and also a retired (20 yr) U.S. Marine and (20yr) Border Patrol Agent, I am truly suffering as a result of out of control property taxes and insurance rates.
As a retired type on a fixed income, it has been increasingly impossible to keep up with these increases, especially when factoring in the cost of fuel.
I only see the glee in which our officials welcome the increased monies they have available through the property tax increased assessments/rates.  As a resident of Inglis, our Police Chief, in an article in the latest "The Newscaster" already has spent the increased windfall and plans increased future spending.  This is especially difficult as only 27% of the population of Inglis pay property tax.
When will one or MORE of our elected officials enact a bill that lowers this out of control assessment and take a stand to bail out the numerous retired, fixed income voters in Florida.  
Lower the mileage and reduce the assessments, refund some of the past outrageous taxes to those who financially support the government. 
Why can't politicians find ways to provide relief in this situation instead of finding new ways to spend, spend, spend and eventually allocate $2.00 for every $1.00 in the coffers.
Thank you for your attention and possible assistance.

Subject:	Insurance

My insurance company, Nationwide, is asking for a rate hike. This will likely be granted. They are asking for at least a 70% increase. The problem I have is that this is an "Across the board" increase. This type of increase does not take into consideration the specific condition of an individuals' home. My home was built in 1963, before the current hurricane codes, and my insurance company says that is why my rate was already increased. But no one has surveyed my home to determine if this is a true statement.
   The house is all concrete block walls, even most of the interior walls. The roof is all hip design, with no eaves, and a low pitch, which offers little area for the winds to act on. In addition, I am at an elevation that virtually eliminates flooding concerns. I am on a hill, which is surrounded by higher hills, which serve to block the effects of high winds. I have 15 sheets of plywood stored for covering windows and doors, which are all numbered and fitted. I have two generators, one wired to the house with a transfer switch, and one as a spare. I keep over fifty gallons of bottled water on hand, as well as enough food to feed an army. This house has never suffered any damage due to any of the storms which have made direct hits on Hernando county. The power went out during several storms in the past, sometimes for a week. I had power the entire time. I work for the federal government, maintaining the emergency power system for a Veteran's Hospital, I know how to keep the lights on.
   Now, I am facing an another increase in my property insurance, which will break my budget. The first casualty will be my retirement plan, which is the first place I can cut expenses. Then the "For sale" signs will go up. Part of the expense I am experiencing is a bailout of the Citizens insurance plan. My health insurance has gone up. My auto insurance has gone up. And now my homeowner's is going up again. The same thing happened in New Jersey. Auto insurance rates were raised until most of the insured were on a state run auto insurance plan, all while the policies were being serviced by the agents of the same companies that caused the problem in the first place. The companies got paid to write and maintain the policies, and the state fund paid any claims. A clear win-win situation. Now we have Citizens, so companies can raise their rates without fear, because the state will take up the slack.
    Why did I bother to take all these Hurricane prevention measures, when I am being made to suffer for all those who don't do a thing to help themselves? I put a new roof on my house last year, because I wanted to make sure that I could withstand the storms. I put it on with my own two hands, and even Code enforcement was impressed by the measures I took to go the extra mile. I even stored bundles of shingles in case some should blow off, Not likely since they are all held down by twice the nails that code requires. Where is my reward for all this extra work and expense? It's sticking out of my back, right between the shoulder blades.

Subject:	My Request as a Concerned Professor

Dear Gov Bush: The cost of living in Florida is extremely high. You know the gas prices here.  We are teachers. I travel a long way from Boca to Miami to teach classes. PLEASE, Gov, UDDATE the teachers and college adjuncts salaries here in Florida. If you look at any website, you will find that the average salary for a normal person is 60,000 (Where?).  Check how much adjunct faculty with a Master's degree get at the colleges here (MDC, BCC?).  
 
I find that our purchasing power has diminished by 50% throughout the years. Our salaries have not increased or have increased by a very small percentage.  
 
My advise as an American citizen CONCERNED about education is that you update the salaries to a minimum of 60,000 for full time teachers in the schools and colleges (This is the same or below to what teachers get in other states)  and 3000 per course for adjuncts (Now being 1800).  Otherwise, we are going to close the colleges. There will be no teachers( since they will move to other states) and no students.
 
Change Board of Trustees, do something to update education and give teachers and professors in all districts and colleges the pay they deserve! There should be MORE action in education towards the benefit of our students.
 
Thank you, Gov. I know you will think about this.

Was reading today about how state farm pulled there proposed increase to propose an even larger one. The original was;
The proposed increase would have hit its 58,000 local customers even harder -- an average 117.3 percent in Charlotte, 116.1 percent in Sarasota and 113 percent in Manatee counties.

That would have added $1,741 to a $1,500 annual premium in Sarasota County.
First it is becoming extremely hard to stay a resident of Florida with these costs.
Second could someone explain to me that all there supposed losses & State Farm for one had an extreme proift this year as always why that they are allowed to increase the total homeowner costs of the policy when their supposed losses came from the hurricane part of the policy but they are increasing not only the hurricane part but the fire/theft, etc part. This has to stop, with Citizens surcharge we can also expect a yearly increase with thatr subsidy. I can't see why I am subsidizing someone with a million dollar plus home on the water as well as paying increase policy costs on my own insurance. This has to change.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am asking you to please VETO CBIRS #793, St. Johns River Trailhead Park – Putnam County. This request is in reference to HB5001, page 257/258, "1885 I & Putnam County." I am asking for a line item veto of the $250,000 appropriation.

This request, with a total expected future need of $6 million, does not conform to the criteria, nor did it go through proper review by the Florida Recreation Development and Assistance Program, even though it appears in their budget. In addition, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Office of Greenways and Trails is opposed to a development of this magnitude at the Buckman Lock Visitors Center. 

The proposed location for the park is in the Ocala to Osceola wildlife corridor, considered one of the most important wildlife corridors in the SE United States, and would adversely impact listed species such as the Sherman Fox squirrel, Florida black bear, Florida manatee,and bald eagle. 

State planners and biologists should determine the best location for 
facilities in state parks, not special interest groups. Please don’t use the public’s money to fund what violates the public’s interest.

Subject:	Insurance

I am concerned about the recent decision by Citizens' Insurance not renewing polices for Builder's Risk. I am very concerned about how this is going to effect the entire state of Florida. 

How can the insured's last resort be allowed to make this decision. I am licensed & work in insurance. I have been concerned with the recent lack of coverage by all companies regarding wind coverage and now that Citizens, who is the last resort has decided to stop writing builders risk. How can the bank loan money on new houses or buildings? What is the fate of all new construction at this point? What will happen to buildings in progress that will not be renewed at renewal? Will we have many unfinished construction sites? Will this cause many bankruptcies? What is the solution? Time is running out as the deadline to write any builders risk in July15,2006.

I am concerned about the lack of wind coverage in general. There is no coverage at all in Palm Beach County unless you are in the wind pool area for Citizens. This will put many businesses out of business. This will have an effect on all of us as this will surely increase the prices of everything as businesses will have to increase their prices to cover the up to 300% increase in property coverage August 1,2006. What will the homeowners that are just getting by now do? Will this cause them to lose their house? This is in fact already sending many homeowners to live elsewhere, other states.

The current hurricane forecast is alarming? The current resources are limited and as you are aware from past hurricanes the damage just one hurricane can create in a metropolitan area is astronomical. 

I am asking you as Governor of the State of Florida to take action to protect our great state! Perhaps this is also a time to come up with a viable national solution for wind coverage for all coastal states. All Politicians have an obligation to protect the people they serve. You have the power to help us if you so choose to do so.

Please take action now, help the people now!! If you act now, the people will love you for it and remember that you were the one that cared about them, if you don't …….then the people will not like you at all and they will remember that as well, probably even more!

Thank you very much!

Subject:	Builders Risk with Citizens Property Ins. Co.

We are an independent agency owned by a community bank in Palm Beach County. 

I understand that Citizens Property Insurance Company was formed as an insurer of last resort. When all of the companies writing insurance in the state of Florida stopped writing hurricane coverage or they left the state all together to avoid writing wind coverage, Citizens would pick up the gap in coverage and write the wind coverage. In the case of homeowners, they wrote the entire policy & that is also true for condominium associations throughout Florida.

Since we are owned by a bank with 52 branches in mostly Palm Beach County, which write a lot of new residential and commercial loans for new construction and remodeling of homes and businesses we receive referrals for the builders risk coverage from a majority of these customers and have always been confident that we could help the customer.

When we received word that effective 7/15/06 Citizens would no longer be writing builders risk coverage for commercial or commercial residential, you can imagine our surprise and disappointment in the State of Florida!

After the last couple of years, we all thought that the government for the State of Florida would pull together and figure out a solution for the lack of companies and coverage's, before something drastic happened and we were left with HUGE gaps in coverage for our tax paying citizens! 

To our GREAT disappointment, the legislative session not only didn't address the problem, but it seems that the bureaucratic/bipartisan rhetoric in our state failed miserably to help the people who have been increasingly hit with high costs! 

People who are working are having a difficult time making ends meet and cannot pay the premiums that they are being hit with. The fact that the people on a fixed income are having to decide between taxes and insurance, as opposed to food and shelter, is something that your office and government body should be ashamed of! 

I use to be proud to help people with their insurance needs, but I am ashamed to be affiliated with it now as the industry is bleeding people dry and you are the only one that can fix the situation.

I STRONGLY recommend that you hold a special session and fix this situation before it goes into effect 7/15/06. 

The lack of urgency in amending the wind insurance problem in Florida is having a profound effect on our economy, with tens of thousands of home up for sale, forfeitures, businesses out of business and soon our entire economy will collapse! Anyone in the Florida government should be thrown out and left with no option to ever run for a governmental position again, if they cannot stand behind one of the proposals (like a federal program for wind coverage like the flood program) that the insurance companies have been discussing for several years!

Please set a special session to stop this atrocity from happening on 7/15/06 and put a good plan into effect before we all lose our homes, businesses and all leave the state of Florida!

Thank you in advance-A concerned citizen, tax payer and VOTER in Florida,

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush: 

We have received  the issue that NO BUILDER RISK for Commercial business will being written via The CITIZENS INSURANCE after JULY 15,2006. 

I am here to oppose against this statute. As an underwriter being in this business over 20 years, this is by far the most frightening

Matter that I have encountered.We  in this industry already find it very difficult to market a risk in an admitted carrier's- It is possing a tremendous problem with our clients who at this point are not happy being told of this situation.  

I got to admit we are failing as long time floridians & the future for florida is not a good one! 
I don't think that you will gain a majority of voters if this statute is not changed.  
  
Please if you could, help make the decision for Citizens Property to retain this service as it very 
Important and necessary market. 

Hope that you will reconsider the potential damage now that it doing to all business.

Subject:	Condo elevator generator bill

Dear Governor Bush,

I'm writing about the recent House bill you signed requiring condominiums over 620 ft. tall ... that's usually about seven floors, to have generators for at least one elevator. The Sun-Sentinel also wrote that you had serious concerns about other condo law bills so you vetoed them.  Apparently this condominium generator bill didn't set off any alarm bells for you, but it should have. 

Any condo building of more than one story should be required to have a generator. Do you think the lawmakers who crafted this law thought all the people who use wheelchairs and walkers and scooters or have limited mobility would be OK as long as they just lived below the seventh floor? I can't wait for karma to kick in for every one of those legislators who voted to approve this law the way it was written, so they can get a taste of their own short-sightedness.

I think you should have vetoed the generator bill and sent it back to the House and told them to rewrite it so it would help all condo owners ... not just those on the upper floors.

I just moved to Florida last year and this upcoming election will be the first one since I arrived. I've already registered and received my voter's card so I'm armed and loaded (so to speak) to vote in the next election. 

 

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter in the near future.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I wish to express my deep concern for the events unfolding next week with Citizens Property Insurance Corporation. 

I work in an agency located in Palm Beach County that is owned by a Bank and write a lot of Builder's Risk business. 
I am sure you are aware that most of Palm Beach & Broward County (our client base) is located in the wind pool.  
Many of our customers are building homes (as are many people all over the State of Florida) and are located in the wind pool. 

With bank requirements demanding windstorm coverage where are these people to turn!  

Citizens is suppose to be "Insurer of Last Resort".  If a Florida resident cannot find coverage from our "Insurer of Last Resort" what are they suppose to do, move to another State!  What would that do for our economy!

Please call a special session before next Friday, July 14, 2006 that day Citizens will stop offering the builder's risk product.  

Your Florida residents need you to intervene. 

Remember you are OUR Governor, The residents Governor and WE NEED YOUR HELP!! Protect us! 

Sincerely,

In my 51 years as a loyal Republican, Florida resident, homeowner, former business owner, you qualify as the lamest lame duck Governor that I can remember.  I am ashamed to admit that I voted for you twice, particularly after you approved over one half million dollars to be distributed among a legislature, "for a job well done", after, under your leadership, the biggest crisis of this state was completely ignored.  That crisis, since you don't seem to recognize it, is the Homeowners Insurance Crisis, which is driving good citizens from the state, hurting the economy and driving many homeowners into foreclosure or bankruptcy. Your non-action along with your two Republican Governor "want to be's"; one with a terrible track record and the other who hasn't even mentioned the insurance crisis are heading for a big surprise come election day.  Incumbent politicians better start looking for new employment along with your appointed Insurance Commissioner.  I'm sure your brother in Washington will be proud when you hand over the state of Florida to the Democrats.
 
Why don't you personally respond to this?  I have written you many times begging you, as many others have, to do something about this crisis and all we get is a stupid reply from some third rate flunky.  Incidentally, I belong to a large group gathering a large number of signatures on petitions demanding action on this crisis and there are several other large groups doing the same, plus some looking into a class action suit.  Don't you think it is time you show that you care about this State even if you are on the way out.  Right now you are on the way of leaving a bad taste in a lot of mouths (some that are short of food because of your in-action).

We are expecting an immediate response from Messrs.

The problems do not stop there as owners of rental
properties will pass along these costs to tenants, if
such potential renters are willing to pay the

from the State who will decide that, notwithstanding
the coming depression of the real estate market based

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
	My name is Alyce Lewis.  I am a homeowner in Pasco County and I
am writing to you to ask you to PLEASE address the insurance crisis in
the state.  I' m sure you have heard all of this before, but I hope that
you can listen to it again.  I am a single parent of 3 lovely teenagers
(15, 13 and 12).  I make a decent living in the medical field - I
currently work for the Dept of VA affairs and part time for a local
hospital.  I have Citizens and my insurance premium went from $1800 in
2005 to $3986 in 2006.  I can not afford to put my insurance in escrow,(
if I  escrowed my insurance my mortgage would be more than one of my
paychecks), so I opt to pay with my income tax return.  I can tell you
that I was in tears in April when I had to write the check and send it
to Citizens.  My house was Built in 1975 and is in need of repairs.  I
can not fix the house when I am working to keep food on the table and
gas in the car so that I can work.  I was told by my insurance agent
that handles my Citizens account that they are going to raise my premium
by 70%.   How can this be?  I have to now try and sell that only asset
that I have - MY HOME- because I can no longer afford to keep it and
raise my children.  There lies the real problem, selling my house in
PASCO COUNTY, where no one can afford that insurance.  I am asking you
to please ask for a fiscal review of CITIZENS insurance.  I am tired of
hearing the same excuse - sinkholes are the problem.  NO ONE IN MY
NEIGHBORHOOD  has had a sink hole.  I don't even need flood insurance.
I want to thank you for your time.

My insurance company "Safeway" dropped me to lesser THEIR risk to hurricanes.  Now I will be FORCED to go to Citizen's and pay a premium of $1,400.00 whereas I was ONLY paying $382.00.  I am on disability and JUST DON'T HAVE THIS MONEY.

Subject:	Property taxes

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I thank you again for appointing me as Property Appraiser in 2003, I was elected in 2004.

My reason for writing you today is to thank you for creating a committee to study what to

do about property taxes.  There were several good bills before the legislature this session,

homestead portability, cap on all property until sale, increase homestead exemption, I think 

there was also an amendment to cap the amount a taxing authority can increase their budget

each year, I could not believe some of these bills failed to pass.

 

Using Bay County as an example, values and revenues have doubled in the past two years.

I’ve had several conversations with Commissioners and School Board members asking them to

consider lowering their millage rates, it seems to fall on deaf ears, I even sent each taxing

authority a letter, asking them to consider lowering millage rates. The response was

mostly, it’s none of my business.

 

Bay County has finally become a Republican majority, all County Commissioners are Republican

and all School Board members are Republicans; I think we are sending the wrong type of message,

forgetting we are suppose to be the Conservative Party.

 

Taxing authorities increasing their budgets to the max will most likely set themselves up for having to

Increase their millage rates in the coming years, especially if the values continue to adjust downward.

The tax burden on many properties in Bay County will most likely place many more properties on the

market and drive values downward, resulting in fewer revenues in the future.

 

Another thought is when legislatures look at property tax legislation they should get input from 

Property Appraisers, via their associations, it would simplify laws and give them a better understanding

of the system.

 

Sincerely,

 

Rick Barnett

Subject:	Homestead Exemption not keeping up with home price

Governor,
I moved to Florida in 1997 as an active military member stationed at MacDill AFB, in Tampa.  We purchased a nice house for $92,000 and the homestead exemption was $25,000.  In 2000, I transferred to other state.  Now I am retired military and have moved back to Florida.  Our home value at $343,000 - $25,000 homestead - $5,000 for disability = $313,000. My property tax is over $6,000/yr and it will go up again next year.  This $25,000 exemption was good ten years ago.  Today, with the average home price is over $200,000 the standard exemption is just not keeping up with the home price.  I would like to see the change and increasing the exemption to 25% of the appraise value.
Thank you for reading this.

Dear Governor John Ellis Bush:	
 	
On March 1, NAMI released "Grading the States: A Report on America's Health Care System for Serious Mental Illness." The report includes specific information on our state and I believe you will find the report helpful as you and your colleagues consider legislation and policy that impacts our state mental health system. A copy of the report is available online at: www.nami.org/grades. As you review this report, there are some key points that I hope you keep in mind. -- No state received an "A". We have significant room for improvement. We would not tolerate any grade but an "A" for cancer or cardiac care. Therefore, we cannot accept any other grade for our mental healthcare system either. -- A quality system must include a recovery focus and emphasis on consumer and family involvement. -- The grades represent a system-wide grade, not just a grade on our mental health agency. Treatment of mental illness requires a broad- based solution that reaches beyond agency boundaries. Our state recieved a low C B in some areas F in others. We are as astate making some progress but Our number of mentally ill are increasing faster. -- Please pay close attention to the urgent needs section of our state narrative. These are priority concerns and should be addressed quickly. Each state, including ours, is also credited for innovations. These are important and provide templates for improving our system of care. Medicaid now accounts for a majority of publicly- funded mental health services. Changes to our state Medicaid program can have negative consequences on people living with mental illness. As a constituent, I am counting on you to give serious attention to this report. The findings cannot be taken lightly. When quality treatment is available, people recover. When the system fails, lives are lost,And the state spends more on hospital stays and time spent in jails for those who fall through the cracks Our state must do better and I am asking you to take leadership in helping meet the challenges outlined in this report.Please have this report considered as one of your focuses

Subject:	Tax free shopping

Governor Bush,
 
As a teacher in Volusia County, I appreciate the tax free days for shopping.  However, it is very frustrating when students get to school (after the tax free days July 22-30) to pick up their schedules and supply lists only to find out the supplies they purchased are not the ones they need for classes.  It then becomes a burden on the parents to have to go out and purchase more supplies after the tax free days have passed. 
 
Since schools start in August, maybe we need to have one tax free week for clothes shopping and another one the week the majority of schools are opening for school supplies.  
 
Thank you,

Subject:	Home Owners Insurance/How to Cut Cost

Sir:
      There are two different ways you could handle the Insurance Problem in Fl.
 
(1) Change the Citizen Insurance to a Tax Home Owners Insurance Company. By doing this the Home Owner would be able to recover his insurance cost off his federal taxes. By making it a Tax for home owners to pay and also private company 's who would also get the deduction.
 
(2)
      The second way would be to legalize Gambling so that Casino's could be built  in Fl , Places like  Orlando, Tampa,  and so on. This way you would take in over $1,000.000.00 a day like in NJ and and maybe even more and have the money go to the Citizen Insurance Company .The State Of Florida would be set. You would be able to cut the rates back to where they should be and save our homes  and  Business in Florida. If not the next thing you will lose is that Private business will move out because insurance will put them out.
As far as the Casino go you would have State workers control different type of jobs like they do in NY and set up a Gaming Comm. The public would vote for this to save their homes. Also, the Private insurance company would gome back knowing they could get help from the State Insurance also.

I would very much like you to look into the problems with the insurance company above.
I know you are leving office, but we very much need your help while you are still in office.
 
I live in a condominium in Port Richey, Fl. which is approx 30 years old.  We had insurance with Allstate until they pulled out of Florida and therefore were forced into Citizens.
We are a 55 and older community and consist of 152 units.
We were just advised that our insurance went from 60,000 dollars a year to 355,000 a year.
Everyone is being forced with an assessment of 2100 dollars and our monthly charges will be increased from 212.00 monthly to 425.00 monthly
There are many people here living on social security of 800.00 a month and just cannot pay those charges.
I realize that insurance companys have to increase their rates, but a 700% increase is outrageous.  
Many people are trying to sell their units and leave the state but the property value has dropped so low because of what Citizens has been allowed to do.
Please Mr. Bush do whatever you have to do so that we can stay in the state.
I am fortunate enough to still work, but I myself cannot afford the increases.
I would greatly appreciate your reply to us so that we might have some brightness in our lives.
 
Thank you

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I am hereby filing a petition/complaint pertaining to bill 466 which states  a Trainee appraisers course requirements be increased from 75 hours to 100 hours.   I am currently enrolled in that class at Miami Dade College.  We were informed just yesterday that we will not be getting our license until we complete the additional 30 hours and pay an additional fee of $295.00.      The state and the school has made it practically impossible for me to complete this course as I can not afford the additional fee or abide by their new schedule of Mon-Fri  6:30-10:30 pm.   I don’t understand why the state has made this bill effective July 1st already towards the end of the class ( ends August 1st ) and did not even consider to grandfather us in. 

 

I have contacted the school to at least request waiving of the fee and/or extending our current class and they have refused.

You are our only hope to resolve this matter.   Please feel free to contact me via e-mail at gnoa74@yahoo.com or my phone at 786-303-4662.

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
I got the news yestersday by my professor that you signed the State Bill 400 into law effective on July 1, 2006. This changed has affected not only myself but hundreds of student who are currently in the Trainee-AB1 course and are about to finish the 75 requirement. Making this last minute change and extending the hours from 75 to 100 during the end of the course has cause a great disapointment. Why couldn't you make this law into effective for the fall term or maybe starting Jan. 2007 and let those students who are currently in class complete the course with 75 hours as I/we originally signed up for. This is not fair! Now we are FORCE to take the ADII for 30 hours which is going to cause many students at  Miami Dade College $295.00 more out of pocket. I agree with continueing education, but not like this. Not only I have to pass my AB1 exam, I also now have to consider passing ABII exam in order to get my Trainee license. Please make a change on the effective date or make a Grandfather clause for those students who are effected because of this July 1st change and let us complete our AB1 for 75 hours since we are almost done.

Subject:	[*] Grant money for hurricane assistance

Good Afternoon,
Its not often I voice my opinion but in this case I felt strongly about the Grant program that I had not heard about prior to an article in the Naples Daily News this past week.
After reading the article I went on the web-site (myfloridahome.com.) for more information.   
I was informed that the program was approved in May and that you cannot make application until August.   After the application and process of an inspector to determine the homeowners ability to qualify, a determination of what funds will be allocated to the homeowner will be reviewed  and processed.    I am a widow who could qualify for the Grant, except, that very day I started to purchase material to secure my home which I have lived in for 32 yrs.   Some material had to be ordered and will not arrive for another 5 to 6 weeks.    If I wait until August to start securing my home and have to wait for Labor and Material to get started the Hurricane Season will be Over.    As a Governor who has undergone some of the worst Hurricane Season during his terms in office, I find it hard to believe this program was not started earlier.
I understand thru the program if you have any required work done to your home prior to receiving your inspection etc. you do not qualify.    There are many people in my situation that are honest, hard working citizens who could use a little monetary assistance that, who could prove with receipts and an inspection, that work has been done during this time should be able to quality for the Grand money available.  Many of my friends started in June the beginning of HURRICANE SEASON to take advantage of the no sales tax week to secure equipment, material, shutters etc.   Why wasn't this program started about the same time, so those that could use a little help, would be eligible?????????
I would like to know who the program was suppose to help if we have a Hurricane prior to the program.
My friends and I would probably do more to secure our homes with a little Grand Money, but we will have to do less since we will not be eligible for the program and have had  to get started as soon as possible to secure our homes which are not up to the new codes enforced after Hurricane Andrew.

Subject:	State Monopoly

Please be advised the insurance agents licensed in the State of Florida are NOT looking forward to working for a State Monopoly, namely Citizens Property Insurance Company. 
 
Florida's current policy of barring any new insurance companies from selling homeowners policies in Florida is a fraudulent scam and terrible injustice perpetrated on the property owners in Florida that is already causing a terrible and repulsive stench, the effects of which will be reflected in the next election, if not before. The news of these unfair business practices being implemented by our own government against our citizens is not being reported by the media, but I suspect that will have to change soon. 
 
The latest company to fall victim to Florida's Government scam is First Fidelity, a new and well-funded company who planned to sell auto and property insurance, with Homeowners rates far below those charged by Citizens Property Insurance Company. No reason was given for the State's denial to First Fidelity, but a company spokesperson writes, 
 
"After 10 months of exceedingly hard work accomplishing the nearly impossible tasks of obtaining significant capital commitments approaching $50 million dollars, obtaining reinsurance in a tough property market, designing competitive property and casualty products with a state of the art software backbone, contracting with the most qualified vendors to provide the best service possible to our customers  --  all in a market where a carrier offering to write new homeowner policies is desperately needed; we can no longer proceed as Office of Insurance Regulation would not approve First Fidelity's certificate of authority."
 
If the State wishes Citizens Property Insurance Company to become a regular insurance company, as was reported by the St Petersburg Times, the State can practice the same rules and guidelines it enforces on all regulated professional service companies and licensed professionals. We will not stand by while our elected officials use unfair business practices to create this monopoly on property insurance and scam the citizens of Florida.

Subject:	The One Big Crisis!

Governor Bush: 
   Today's St Petersburg Times business section added more evidence that the Florida homeowner's insurance mess is the biggest crisis you have faced in your near 8 years as Governor. 
   First there's the article, "Another insurer asks for huge hike". Nationwide has joined the few remaining insurance companies in asking for a 71.4% increase while it refuses to renew 25,000 policies. I'm sure you will tell those Floridians with Nationwide policies how you feel their pain. My, what a consolation that will be to those who can't afford the increase, or get dumped into Citizens with its unaffordable high rates, the result of your compassionate do nothing position.
   Then there's the article, "State takes over policies from insurer Florida Select" which included within it that Tom Gallagher, a member of your do nothing team, says the policyholders take first priority in making sure they have coverage during the hurricane season. He, like you, says nothing about where they are to get the money to pay the exhorbitant premiums that they will eventually have to pay hapless Citizens. Nor do either of you mention the poor slob who has had to cancel his homeowner's insurance protection because of the uncalled for high premiums.
   As I said, this is the one and only real crisis faced by the people of Florida and your Administration since you've been in office. The people of Florida have been waiting for you to do what's right, but you have failed them. You put out statements and figures on a State Catastrophe Property Insurance Program that are at the very least misleading, some would say they are deliberately meant to mislead.
   Anyone who understands the purpose of insurance, functions of an actuary, the job of an underwriter, and the workings of insurance companies knows that what you are saying is not so, and knows that the feeble offerings you make to solve the problem will accomplish nothing. You and your staff can't be that much in the dark not to realize that a State Cateastrophe Property Insurance Program with a flat per $1,000 of value insured throughout the state is the only viable solution. No, you refuse to admit to it solely because the Democrats proposed it. My what a destructive force pride can be.
   I've been a Republican for 50 plus years and lived under many Governors, Republican and Democrat, in four different states, but I have never seen an administration fail the people like your's has in such a serious crisis.

Dear Governor Bush,

I have a home in north Walton County, more than 30 miles from the coast and 200 feet above sea level.   Hurricane insurance on my home has "gone thru the roof" this year.  

While I have no real beef with those willing to risk their own money in extravagant construction on the uncertain sands of south Walton, I do raise a hackle when I'm forced to help subsidize their folly.   

Citizens Property Insurance has become a scam on Florida's more prudent homeowners.    Please do something to rein it in.

An Unwise Growth Subsidy?
Insurance
By Mike Vogel

Citizens insures $5 billion worth of construction projects in places many believe are unwise to build. Should Florida homeowners be on the hook for a $74-million condo project?

 

Most attention to Citizens Property Insurance focuses on the insurance coverage it provides to home and condo owners who can’t get insurance in the private market.
Citizens also provides other types of insurance, however — including a type of insurance to developers that critics say stimulates building in high-risk areas and will leave residential policyholders all over the state on the hook for the bill if a storm strikes the projects.

That “builders risk” insurance provides coverage to developers while their buildings are under construction. And the exposure Citizens has under those builders risk policies is growing rapidly — up by some $800 million this year alone. At the end of May, Citizens was covering 5,723 construction projects — condos, single-family homes, commercial buildings — with a total exposure of $5.1 billion.Without Citizens’ writing builders risk coverage, the state could see some of that $5.1 billion in development, and its jobs and economic opportunity, curtailed.

But critics say that by writing coverage in areas that private insurers find too risky, Citizens encourages development where it shouldn’t occur. And it all but guarantees that when the projects are done, the owners will wind up having to get their homeowners insurance from Citizens. That thwarts, rather than advances, the state’s goal of shrinking what has become Florida’s largest insurer.

In addition, because Citizens can assess non-Citizens policyholders everywhere in Florida to cover its losses, inland homeowners could pay more than what they already do to cover losses of coastal developers building projects the private market won’t cover.As with Citizens windstorm homeowners policies, the builders risk coverage involves properties in high-risk coastal areas. One builders risk policy covers a $74-million condo under construction on the beach. (Citizens is prohibited by law from identifying its customers.) Earlier this year, 1,000 of Citizens’ policies were for more than $1 million each, and the 10 biggest projects Citizens insures total $447 million in exposure.Geographically, Citizens’ heaviest risk is in southeast Florida, where it has $2.1 billion in vulnerabilities, and northwest Florida, where it has $1.3 billion in exposure. Typically required by lenders, builders risk has a sliding scale of vulnerability for an insurer — almost nothing when a project is just coming out of the ground but a large risk in the final days of construction.Like traditional homeowners insurance [“Breaking Point,” June, FloridaTrend.com], builders risk has gotten expensive and scarce after eight Florida hurricanes in two years. “It’s not so much that they won’t write, but the pricing is … there’s sticker shock,” says Matt Wester, agent relations administrator for the Florida Surplus Lines Service Office, a state-mandated non-profit association of agents who sell the specialty insurance products that fall under the surplus lines designation. High-priced projects, for which insurers turn to the reinsurance markets for support, are particularly tough to insure, he says.Pat Chouinard, a vice president and insurance broker with Amwins Brokerage of Florida in Tampa, says private carrrier coverage that cost 30 to 40 cents per $100 of value a year ago now costs as much as $1.50 per $100. A few carriers have stopped writing new builders risk coverage that includes windstorm insurance in Southeastern coastal states. Noting the condo buildings proposed for Tampa, Chouinard says, “You just wonder, who’s going to write the coverage on those?”

Unlike Citizens, with its $74-million exposure on a single property, private sector insurers usually layer coverage on large projects, with different carriers taking different pieces of the risk — one taking, say, the first $5 million in losses, another the next $5 million.The Florida Insurance Council, an insurance industry group, has urged the state to get Citizens out of the builders risk business in high-hazard areas. “If Citizens is the only source for this coverage, it will be the only insurer available for the homes or businesses when they are completed,” according to a Florida Insurance Council report in February. “These are structures that are essentially uninsurable and should not be built.”The state’s insurance consumer advocate, Steve Burgess, says Citizens might want to consider the advisability of continuing builders risk insurance. “I would like to see the policymakers take a look at it and let every stakeholder bring forward their arguments. When you talk about $5 billion of exposure, I think it’s worth a look.”There is precedent for Citizens to leave a market in which the surplus lines industry offers coverage. The Legislature this year required Citizens, beginning in 2008, to stop insuring homes that are valued at more than $1 million. The state was trying to lower Citizens’ exposure to expensive properties [“Too Many Mansions?” February 2005, FloridaTrend.com].Citizens’ board supported eliminating coverage for the $1 million-and-up market and in a meeting in late June was scheduled to consider getting out of the builders risk business in high-risk areas. Citizens spokesman Justin Glover acknowledges that “eliminating coverage would be a way to reduce exposure.”

I understand that you have authorized close to $1 million to study some of
the effects of various proposals that were floated in Tallahassee this
spring in regards to the Homestead Exemption and portability of the Save our
Homes amendment.  However, what I am asking is, at this particular point in
time, do you or do you not, support any of the options I have listed above.

A direct, Yes/No answer would be greatly appreciated.

Sir:

I do not understand how Florida's natural desaster is hurricanes and our 
representatives could leave us at the mercy of a couple of rouge Insurance 
Companys whose only purpose is profit at the expense of your constituents 
"American Dream" of homeownership.In 2004 /0 5 my insurance rose from just 
under $1700 to $2592;in 2005/06 it rose again to$3903and for2006/07 I am now 
faced with a bill of$7843.00. Pray tell me, am I paying for the city block? 
Nothing has changed in my home except proper maintenance ie a new roof ,storm 
shutters,properly trimmed
trees, no debris that can become misiles..etc..etc. Am I being punished for 
being a good citizen. If Floridians had 
gutts they would force change. Allstate and StateFarm were allowed to stop 
selling homeowners policies but allowed to continue to do the more lucrative 
business in other areas ie auto, life etc. They should be boycotted as for 
years they collected our premiums and squandered our moneys (this is where you 
come in) they should have been mandated to have reserves way above what they 
had..do the math..If they
had invested our money for its intended purpose instead of spending it and 
hoping for the best...(I should be allowed to do that and not be penalized by 
my mtg company because I
cant afford the present premium) Hurricane Andrew and the supsequent ones would 
have been rough to handle but we
wouldnt have the delima we have now if the proper vision
was in place and it was florida law that if you cant offer all
insurance then you cant do business in the state.. They should be made to take 
the bad with the good just like all the rest of us., Before hurricane Andrew 
what was the last
catastrophe the Insurance Companies had to deal with?
So where are the premiums that they had collected...and dont tell me that the 
premiums were smaller because so were the payouts and they got increase after 
increase and then dumped us because the people whom we have elected
failed to stop them. Serious consideration has to be given to
what is happening inSouth Florida as a lot of little people
are going to be losing their homes to foreclosue. Gas is at its highest,
insurance is causing increases in mortgage payments in the hundreds of dollars, 
everything is costing one to five hundred percent more,yet wages are low. 
Employers are giving
increases of pennies per hour. How many more hours can families work how many 
more jobs can they get? there are only twentyfour hours in a day. Who is 
raising the children the television because Mom can,t come homeand Dad doesn't
come home he's at work. The social impact of all of this pressure is going to 
be huge.

In summary all I am saying is that Florida law makers /
our representatives must do a better job when it comes to things like 
insurance..lets face it the hurricanes are not going to stop.. we have no 
control over them. So since we can't relocate Florida... PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO 
PROTECT FLORIDIANS..from the scoundrels in the Insurance Industry,and please 
tell me if you authorised the kind of rate increase that I got.Thank You, Enid 
Clarke

Anyway, if MS Keels happens across this, I would like to say hello, also, I am doing very well, I am a commercial semi driver, well, I guess I should get to my point here.
 
I applied for restoration of my civil rights a while ago, two years ago, I believe and was wondering how that may have went, I would like very much to be able to vote as well as get a passport, it would expand some of my goals, I am going to flight school if I get the restoration of rights, but would still stay in transport as I like the work, Thanks for your time, Lisa

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I am an RN married to a police officer.  We have both lived in Florida for more than 20y.  We have worked long and hard both at our jobs and with our own hands to build our dream home here in Florida.  Today we received the devastating news that we could lose everything we have worked for.  That news came with the announcement that Nationwide plans to ask for a 71.4% increase in our homeowner's insurance tomorrow.  As I'm sure you know we are not in high paying professions.  However, we do provide very necessary services to the people of Florida.  With the rising cost of homes in Florida, increases in property taxes and now extreme increases in insurance, soon working people like us will no longer be able to afford to live in this state.  Then, who will protect it's population?  Who will care for the sick and injured?  These are questions no one seems to think about.  My income has not increased over the past 10 years.  My husband's income has barely increased enough to cover our rising health insurance coverage costs.  If the insurance company gets their increase we very likely will no longer be able to afford our home.  If we are able to hang on, what happens if there are more hurricanes this year?  Prices go up again and where does that leave us?  Will we be forced, along with many others, to move out of state?  While insurance companies report large profits and pay their executives millions will the rest of us go homeless?  What has happened to America?
 
Sincerely,
Karen Try, RN

Hey Mr.Bush I am a home owner in Polk County Fl. I just heard on the ( Fox 13) news that Nation Wide 
Insurance is wanting to raise their premiums 71% if you and the state let this go through our house payments
will go through the sky. My mortgage payment went up the first of this year already. From $680.00 up to
$716.00 a month and I only get $715.00 a month. I am on a fixed income like most folks in this state
that you run. We can not pay the mortgage we will lose what little we have. How are the people to live here
if the property taxes and insurance keeps going up???. If you want all the AMERICAN people to leave 
your state just tell us to leave don't try to push us out. We will sell you our homes and let you have the 
whole place we can go to a state that will be happy to have our tax money. yes I under stand the hurricanes
done a lot of damage Polk County was the cross track of 4 in 2004. where is all the money that was payed to
them in the past years that no clams was payed out when we had no storms I want to know. I can tell you
it went in all the of the people's pockets in Tallahassee and to pay for the fancy homes that the
white collar people live in. I don't like this at all we elected you to protect the tax payers in the state from
the GOVERMENT screwing us like this. This is the way I see things going on here THE RICH GETS
RICHER WHILE THE POOR DIE from paying taxes and insurance payments. Its got to the piont
that we have to decide to pay them or buy food this is the truth which would you do. Why dont you come down
and just try to live on our income just forget about that you have all your money just come and live the way the

Hello.  I emailed you approximately one month ago about tax free week for schools.  My child goes to a year round school which starts in two weeks (7/18).  You should consider moving up the tax free week so everyone can partake in it.  It is not fair to us that we don't get to save some money like everyone else.  We pay our taxes like everyone else!  We cannot wait for August as she has already needed her supplies since the middle of July.  Please let me know how you can help.

Dear Governor Bush;

 As the Director of a clinic for the primary care of persons with HIV/AIDS, I am very distressed by the signing of SB 1216 (HB 699) which no longer requires an HIV update for licensure renewal for physicians.

While we have made progress in the care and treatment of this illness, we have made none in the area of public education and removal of the stigma associated with HIV.  Medical personnel are not exempt form this prejudice and we often have great difficulty getting medical care for our patients because physicians will not treat them.

The reasons for physicians to be updated on HIV/AIDS go beyond a CME requirement.  The CDC has begun a campaign to make HIV testing a part of routine medical care.  If physicians are not aware of the newest information, they will pass on the outdated information they have.  The new medications available to treat HIV/AIDS can have serious drug interactions, potentially fatal, with medications routinely prescribed in other specialties.  HIV testing is done during prenatal care, physicians who are not updated on the latest treatment for HIV positive pregnant women will not refer and we will see a rise in positive babies born in Florida.

Florida is number one in the US for heterosexual transmission, number two in pediatric AIDS cases and number one, of the states who report, in HIV cases.  The counties represented by the sponsors of this bill are Title I Ryan White providers, the most heavily impacted by this epidemic, and yet, they have failed to recognize the need for HIV education, especially in the medical community.

Every physician in Florida has treated persons with HIV, whether they knew it at the time or not.  Physicians who are responsible enough to stay current on HIV trends will seek out the education they need.  Those who only attend “required” programs will not, and they are the ones who need it the most.

This bill has done a great disservice to the HIV/AIDS community.

Sincerely,

Sharon Murphy, RN, ACRN

Subject:	unfair property taxes

Florida will be ruined by this homestead act that went into effect in 1995. I know when it was passed no one expected the prices to go up so much which is causing the real estate taxes to go up.
 
It is making it impossible for new people to buy homes.  Their taxes will be too high and u will loose families to the carolinas and other areas that dont have this problem..  There is no reason for equal homes to be paying unequal taxes.  It is grossly unfair.  Taxes should be equalized and maybe lower income people should be getting a break and retired people that have lowered incomes.  
 
But as it stands now a millionaire could be paying almost nothing if they r in a house a long time and a new person buying is paying so much more.
 
And homesteaders now want to port their homestead exemption.  That only makes it worse for the snowbirds.  
And they want snowbirds to pay higher insurance so they can pay lower insurance.
 
I am 65 and bought a home in 2000 so that i could retire but now cant afford the real estate taxes.  I am paying almost 3x my neighbors who have the exact house.  this is not fair.  this does not exist in other states.  everyone pays the same but if it is your primary residence you get $776 off your school tax or $1250 if you r a senior and your income is below a certain amount.  Called a star exemption.
 
I cant vote as a snowbird so how can this inequity be changed.  it is getting worse and worse.  I am very upset. I didn't know about this when I bought my house.

July 5, 2006
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
Please call a Special Session of the Florida legislature to resolve our insurance crisis before the Florida economy disintegrates further.  The condominium I own, at Spinnaker Cove, in Tampa, has seen an increase in the hazard insurance rate from $36,000 in 2005 to $350,000 in June, 2006.  That is an increase of over 900%.  Citizen's was our only option for coverage.  We had no coverage while we were awaiting Citizen's slow response.
 
We expect our elected officials to come up with a way to offer financially viable options for insurance of condominiums, such as ours, which has been insured since 1978 with no large claims.  Ignoring this problem will have disasterous effects on the Florida economy.  
 
Feel free to contact me at 813-889-8207 or by email.
 
Yours truly,

Subject:	Grant Recipients Barred from Lobbying

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I recently reviewed a Call For Grant Proposal issued by your administration that prohibits grant recipients from lobbying the executive or legislative branches on any topic related to the granting authority, even if no grant funds are used for that purpose.  Here is the specific language used in the CGP:

"No grantee, including its employees, board members or volunteers may lobby any officials of the executive or legislative branch regarding the (Granting Authority) while also receiving funds under this CGP, even if no grant funds are utilized for that purpose."

I am familiar with the usual prohibition contained in the CGP against using grant funds for lobbying purposes.  This provision goes far beyond the standard prohibition.
 
My concern is that a not-for-profit entity, for which I do volunteer work, decided to not respond to this CGP because of the prohibition against lobbying regarding the Granting Authority, even if the lobbying was unrelated to the grant.  This not-for-profit entity is eminently qualified to produce superior results as called for by the CGP.  This not-for-profit entity, its Board members and volunteers do a great deal of advocacy work, both collectively and individually, with both the executive and legislative branches regarding a wide variety of needs in our community.  The above language in the CGP is so broadly written that we did not feel it prudent to take the chance that, had we been awarded a grant, a volunteer not familiar with the prohibition, might inadvertently violate the provision and put the grant and the not-for-profit entity at risk.
 
I would like to know if you concur in this use of this restriction.  Also, since I've not seen this kind of restriction elsewhere, I'm curious if it is in frequent use in Florida.
 
Based on your track record, I doubt that is the way you expect Florida's government to operate.  In this case, the prohibition had the effect of driving a well-qualified organization away from submitting a grant proposal.  That is a loss for the State and people of Florida.
 
Thank you.

Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor:
 
Thank you for your veto of HB 391.  With respect to the ADR portion of the bill, and particularly the Mediation section: please be advised that any modification or amendment to Mediation requirements should, in some way, require association boards and their attorneys to make a good faith effort to mediate disputes brought before an appointed mediator.  It has been my experience that association/board retained attorneys have no interest in mediating homeowner disputes. Further, their attitude is akin to "what are you going to do about it (?)" when mediation reaches an impasse due to the association/board's attorney's refusal to mediate.  In addition to amending mediation requirements, it is clear that attorneys retained by the board of directors to represent the "association" believe that they represent the board of directors and not the "association".  The "association" is merely an entity (vehicle for operations) which if not financially supported by the membership will no longer exist.  Ergo, boards retain attorneys to represent the membership (which IS the "association") and NOT the members of the board of directors either individually or collectively.  We also understand that attorneys vehemently oppose defining their representation because the numbers of lawsuits may be reduced which, in turn, reduces the attorneys' income stream generated by lawsuits resulting from the basic misunderstanding of who is the "client".  When this basic foundational understanding is statutorially expressed in 718, 719, and 720 F.S. then we can begin to move forward with more meaningful resolutions of the monumental problems facing Florida common interest community homeowners.

Subject:	[*] Emergency Room overcrowding

Dear Govenor Bush, It would appear you are being drafted for an attempt to solve a problem involving waiting times in Emergency Rooms in Florida.Please have your staff access the July 2 commentary from the Tampa Tribune.They broached the rhetorical question--"What other ideas are out there".
                              I suggest that the Florida legislature enact legislation that requires that health insurance companies operating in the state of Florida pay primary care physicians(PCPS)for the following ICD-9 codes:99058--emergent visits disrupts schedule,99050 after hours visit closed schedule,99051 after hours visit  regular schedule.Personally I would recommend these codes be paid only to PCPS, not specialists,not walk-in clinics.Recognise that the few insurance companies that pay for these codes do so at such paltry levels as to make no discernable impact on the practice patterns of PCPS.The managed care companies will reply that they pay according to the Medicare fee schedule and that these codes are not paid by Medicare. That is a remarkably lame argument and should be promptly ignored.It matters not one twit what or what not Medicare will pay.The reimbursement on these codes must be high enough to induce PCPS to change practice patterns.
                                Furthermore enact legislation that requires payment of laboratory and procedures needed to adequately evaluate urgent care patients. For example if a patient comes to my office with typical managed care insurance and shortness of breath the following Clia waved bedside tests would not be paid for : D-Dimer(a test for pulmonary embolism),CPK isoenzymes(a heart attack blood test),BNP(a congestive heart failure blood test).These tests may be very helpful and are available for rapid in office testing.Enact legislation that requires insurance companies operating in the state of  Florida to  pay for certain tests ordered in evaluation of urgent care. These patients would easily be identified by the 99058,99051,99050 codes.To determine what the reimbursement rates and what laboratory and procedures to pay for would require about 3  focus groups of 8 PCPS(family practioners and general internists). I guarantee they could knock this out in about 3 or 4 hours.These are working men and women and have patients to see.
                                   If as well the state could somehow coerce the same considerations from medicare and enact the same changes in Florida medicaid this would increase the impact even further.This legislation certainly does not address multiple problems ,such as lack of insurance but requires no change in the infrastructure or input of tax payer dollars.
                                The proposal has the following added benefits:1)priced accordingly it will encourage PCPS to see their urgent care patients 2)place badly needed revenue into the primary care stream 3)reward PCPS for doing what they do best--treating their sick patients.
                                                                     Sincerely,

Subject:	Suggestion to help teachers

Governor Bush,
 
I am a teacher in Martin County and have been trying to purchase a home.  It is nearly impossible to afford.  I have an idea of how the state can help.
 
First let me go over the affordability issue.  I it were possible to find a median priced home ($250K) which is not easy here, the monthly P&I would be about $1500.  Then the property tax would be about $4275 per year and insurance would be about $1500 per year.  The taxes and insurance works out to be about $500 per month.  This $500 added to the $1500 is what makes houses tough to afford.
 
So my idea is that the state increase homestead exemptions for teachers, firemen and police officers.  It would not cost the state or counties that much in annual revenues but might make attracting and retaining these professionals a little easier.  It would be nice if the exemption were really huge, but any would help.  This past year Martin county revenues increased by 18% due to the much higher cost of property.  I bet that a break to teachers, firemen and police officers would be barely noticable.
 
Please help and help fast.  We are suffering.

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
Please read forwarded email from a nationwide physician search firm.  The pessimistic tone of the recruiter depicts the serious difficulty I am having attracting a quality and qualified OBGYN physician to join my practice in Panama City.  This is in large part to the unaffordable cost of malpractice insurance that forces me and my three partners to "go bare" just to continue to practice in this state. Other pressures continue to make it annually more difficult to practice in this state.
     We still accept medicaid and medicare and are delivering an increasing number of no-pay, mostly Mexican, illegal aliens. But, we have been force to cut back.  We have laid off or lost 5 out of 6 certified nurse midwives in the past two years--the most recent midwife quit midwifery to work as a Labor and delivery nurse. It is clear that the method of  increasing volume of deliveries to increase revenue no longer keeps pace with the reimbursments and certainly no longer justifies the increased risk exposure.  We are always one suit away from having to close our doors.

Dear Governor John Bush:

I am writing today to respectfully request your support for SB 772.
The portion of this large education bill that most concerns me relates to childhood obesity. I know that you care about this issue, too, as evidenced by the task force you created and the resulting Obesity Summits.
As your task force recommended, this bill will empower parents to help improve their children’s health.
In addition, SB 772 will help improve academic achievement in Florida. Healthy students are better students – with increased test scores, concentration and attendance, and reduced discipline problems.


SB 772 will encourage parents, communities, students and schools to work together in the fight against childhood obesity.  
In the U.S., the percentage of overweight children has more than doubled, and the percentage of overweight adolescents has tripled in the past 30 years. In Florida, the trend is similar.
Almost 60% of these overweight children have at least one heart or stroke risk factor, and 25% had two or more risk factors.
The implications of childhood obesity are far-reaching. If childhood obesity continues to increase, the current generation of children and the ones behind them will face devastating health and economic consequences.
Many studies and reports support the connection between academic achievement and student health. We cannot expect our children to excel if they are not physically fit.


Gov. Bush, I know you care about our children. Please demonstrate your support by signing SB 772 into law and helping us all work together on the solutions to childhood obesity.
Thank you in advance for your support.

Governor Bush,
Recently, I received a letter from Broward County's Revenue Collection Division reference my property taxes. The property is currently tenant occupied and the Homestead Exemption has beed deleted. I have been informed that the property taxes have gone from $3362.20 with the Homestead to $7474.61 without it! As much as I try to comprehend why I have to pay such high taxes on a property I have owned since 1996 I can't seem to come up with an answer. I understand that the Homestead is lost once you move out even though you are not using it in any other property (which is another issue), I don't quite understand why the rate increases as if I were buying this property in 2006.  It just does not make since, I would really appreciate if you can explain why the huge difference if I have owned the property since 1996 with a purchase price of $165,000. 
I know I am not the only one that does not comprehend this concept. Many of us have downsized, have kept the property for retirement purposes and see ourselves having to sell because the taxes are unbearable. I understand if I were to buy a new property but as stated before, it does not make since on a property purchased years ago.
It's not a luxury any longer to own another property, it's called financial planning for retirement but now you are making it impossible for it to happen. We need something to be done about this because it's a very serious issue. 
I would really like an explanation that would make sense reference this issue.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I hope I'm still in time to voice my objection before the vote takes place:  I don't want to encourage allowing dogs (or pets of any kind) at outdoor dining areas.  My husband and I love to eat at outdoor dining areas, yet we often can't do that because the outdoor seating is already taken over by smokers.  So now the legislature wants to add still another impediment to our outdoor dining possibilities -- DOGS.  Give us a brake, for goodness sake.  I think dogs are great and my family always had one throughout my childhood.  However, I suffered a serious attack by a neighbor's German Shepherd when I was 18 and am certainly wary of dogs I don't know anywhere I go.  I certainly don't think it's fair to have to deal with them when I go to a restaurant (although some chain's, like Panera's, already allow pets in their outdoor areas.)  I also feel the sanitation issues are important and quite disgusting.
